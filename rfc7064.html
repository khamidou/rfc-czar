	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal Utilities
   for NAT (STUN) protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   STUN is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in
   dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be
   used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to
   it by a NAT, to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints,
   and as a keepalive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  RFC 5389
   [RFC5389] defines the specifics of the STUN protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes are used to designate a stand-
   alone STUN server or any Internet host performing the operations of a
   STUN server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 of RFC 5389
   [RFC5389]).  With the advent of standards such as WebRTC [WEBRTC], we
   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to
   identify and communicate with such a STUN server to carry out the
   STUN protocol.  This implies that endpoints and/or applications must
   be provisioned with the appropriate configuration to identify the
   STUN server. Having an inconsistent syntax adds ambiguity and can
   result in non-interoperable solutions and implementation limitations.
   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes help alleviate most of these
   issues by providing a consistent way to describe, configure, and
   exchange the information identifying a STUN server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such
   as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual English meanings and
   are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Definition of the "stun" or "stuns" URI</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   URI Scheme Syntax</h3></a>

   "stun" and "stuns" URIs have the following formal ABNF syntax
   [RFC5234]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   stunURI       = scheme ":" host [ ":" port ]
   scheme        = "stun" / "stuns"

   <host> and <port> are specified in [RFC3986].  While these two ABNF
   productions are defined in [RFC3986] as components of the generic
   hierarchical URI, this does not imply that the "stun" and "stuns" URI
   schemes are hierarchical URIs.  Developers MUST NOT use a generic
   hierarchical URI parser to parse a "stun" or "stuns" URI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   URI Scheme Semantics</h3></a>

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes are used to designate a stand-
   alone STUN server or any Internet host performing the operations of a
   STUN server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 of RFC 5389
   [RFC5389]).  The STUN protocol supports sending messages over UDP,
   TCP, or TLS-over-TCP.  The "stuns" URI scheme MUST be used when STUN
   is run over TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP), and the
   "stun" scheme MUST be used otherwise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The required <host> part of the "stun" URI denotes the STUN server
   host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the optional DNS discovery procedure mentioned in Section 9 of
   RFC 5389, the "stun" URI scheme implies UDP as the transport protocol
   for SRV lookup, and the "stuns" URI scheme indicates TCP as the
   transport protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As specified in [RFC5389], the <port> part, if present, denotes the
   port on which the STUN server is awaiting connection requests.  If it
   is absent, the default port is 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The
   default port for STUN over TLS is 5349 as per Section 9 of [RFC5389].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986].  These URI schemes are intended for use in specific
   environments that involve NAT traversal.  Users of the scheme need to
   carefully consider the security properties of the context in which
   they are using them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although a "stun" or "stuns" URI does not itself include the username
   or password that will be used to authenticate the STUN client, in
   certain environments, such as WebRTC, the username and password will
   almost certainly be provisioned remotely by an external agent at the
   same time as a "stuns" URI is sent to that client.  Thus, in such
   situations, if the username and password were received in the clear,
   there would be little or no benefit to using a "stuns" URI.  For this
   reason, a STUN client MUST ensure that the username, password,
   "stuns" URI, and any other security-relevant parameters are received
   with equivalent security before using the "stuns" URI.  Receiving
   those parameters over another TLS session can provide the appropriate
   level of security if both TLS sessions are similarly parameterized,
   e.g., with commensurate strength ciphersuites.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This section contains the registration information for the "stun" and
   "stuns" URI schemes (in accordance with [RFC4395]).  Note that these
   URI schemes are intended for use in very specific NAT traversal
   environments and should not be used otherwise on the open Web or
   Internet.

Appendix B.  Design Notes

   o  One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on the URI
      scheme and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g.,
      ";proto=tls").  We decided against this idea because the need for
      ";proto=" for the STUN URI cannot be sufficiently explained, and
      supporting it would render an incomplete specification.  This
      would also result in lost symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.

</p>   o  Following the advice of Section 2.2 of [RFC4395], and because the
      STUN URI does not describe a hierarchical structure, the STUN URIs
      are opaque.
