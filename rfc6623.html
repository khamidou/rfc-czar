   This document creates an IANA registry for the response codes for the
   MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control Package [RFC6231].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are no security considerations, other than those described in
   the MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control Package [RFC6231].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has created the "MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control
   Package Status Codes" registry per this document.  New status codes
   are assigned using the Standards Action process defined in RFC 5226
   [RFC5226].
