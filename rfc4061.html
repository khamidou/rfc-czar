	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   There is a growing interest in routing protocol convergence testing,
   with many people looking at various tests to determine how long it
   takes for a network to converge after various conditions occur.  The
   major problem with this sort of testing is that the framework of the
   tests has a major impact on the results; for instance, determining
   when a network is converged, what parts of the router's operation are
   considered within the testing, and other such things will have a
   major impact on the apparent performance that routing protocols
   provide.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document attempts to provide a framework for Open Shortest Path
   First [OSPF] performance testing, and to provide some tests for
   measuring some aspects of OSPF performance.  The motivation of the
   document is to provide a set of tests that can provide the user
   comparable data from various vendors with which to evaluate the OSPF
   protocol performance on the devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Specification of Requirements</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  RFC 2119
   key words in this document are used to ensure methodological control,
   which is very important in the specification of benchmarks.  This
   document does not specify a network-related protocol.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview and Scope</h2></a>

   Although this document describes a specific set of tests aimed at
   characterizing the single router control plane convergence
   performance of OSPF processes in routers or other boxes that
   incorporate OSPF functionality, a key objective is to propose
   methodologies that produce directly comparable convergence-related
   measurements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following considerations are outside the scope of this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The interactions of convergence and forwarding; testing is
      restricted to events occurring within the control plane.
      Forwarding performance is the primary focus in [INTERCONNECT], and
      it is expected to be dealt with in work that ensues from [FIB-
      TERM].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Inter-area route generation, AS-external route generation, and
      simultaneous traffic on the control and data paths within the DUT.
      Although the tests outlined in this document measure SPF time,
      flooding times, and other aspects of OSPF convergence performance,
      this document does not provide tests for measuring external or
      summary route generation, route translation, or other OSPF inter-
      area and external routing performance.  These areas are expected
      to be dealt with in a later document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The tests should be run more than once, since a single test run
      cannot be relied on to produce statistically sound results.  The
      number of test runs and any variations between the tests should be
      recorded in the test results (see [TERM] for more information on
      what items should be recorded in the test results).
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Reference Topologies</h2></a>

   Several reference topologies that are used throughout the tests are
   described in the remaining sections of this document.  All of the
   topologies have been collectively placed in one section to avoid
   repetition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reference Topology 1 (Emulated Topology)

                           (                   )
      DUT----Generator----(  emulated topology  )
                           (                   )

      A simple back-to-back configuration.  It's assumed that the link
      between the generator and the DUT is a point-to-point link, while
      the connections within the generator represent some emulated
      topology.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reference Topology 2 (Generator and Collector)

                                        (                   )
      Collector-----DUT-----Generator--(  emulated topology  )
             \              /           (                   )
              \------------/

      All routers are connected through point-to-point links.  The cost
      of all links is assumed to be the same unless otherwise noted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reference Topology 3 (Broadcast Network)

      DUT     R1     R2
       |      |      |
      -<pre>+------+------+
</pre>
-----.....

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Any number of routers could be included on the common broadcast
      network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reference Topology 4 (Parallel Links)

        /--(link 1)-----\           (                   )
      DUT               Generator--(  emulated topology  )
        \--(link 2)-----/           (                   )

   In all cases the tests and topologies are designed to allow
   performance measurements to be taken all on a single device, whether
   this is the DUT or some other device in the network.  This eliminates
   the need for synchronized clocks within the test networks.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Basic Performance Tests</h2></a>

   These tests will measure aspects of the OSPF implementation as a
   process on the device under test, including

   o  time required to process an LSA,

   o  flooding time, and

   o  Shortest Path First computation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Time Required to Process an LSA</h3></a>

   o  Using reference topology 1 (Emulated Topology), begin with all
      links up and a full adjacency established between the DUT and the
      generator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note: The generator does not have direct knowledge of the state of
      the adjacency on the DUT.  The fact that the adjacency may be in
      Full state on the generator does not mean that the DUT is ready.
      It may still (and is likely to) be requesting LSAs from the
      generator.  This process, involving processing of requested LSAs,
      will affect the results of the test.  The generator should either
      wait until it sees the DUT's router-LSA listing the adjacency with
      the generator or introduce a configurable delay before starting
      the test.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Send an LSA that is already in the DUT (a duplicate LSA), note the
      time difference between when the LSA is sent and when the ack is
      received.  This measures the time taken to propagate the LSA and
      the ack, as well as the processing time of the duplicate LSA.
      This is dupLSAprocTime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Send a new LSA from the generator to the DUT, followed immediately
      by a duplicate LSA (LSA that already resides in the database of
      DUT, but not the same as the one just sent).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The DUT will acknowledge this second LSA immediately; note the
      time of this acknowledgement.  This is newLSAprocTime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The amount of time required for an OSPF implementation to process
      the new LSA can be computed by subtracting dupLSAprocTime from
      newLSAprocTime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note: The duplicate LSA cannot be the same as the one just sent
      because of the MinLSInterval restriction [OSPF].  This test is
      taken from [BLACKBOX].
      Note: This time may or may not include the time required to
      perform flooding-related operations, depending on when the
      implementation sends the ack: before it floods the LSA further, or
      after it does, or anywhere in between.  In other words, this
      measurement may not mean the same thing in all implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Flooding Time</h3></a>

   o  Using reference topology 2 (Generator and Collector), enable OSPF
      on all links and allow the devices to build full adjacencies.
      Configure the collector so that it will block all flooding toward
      the DUT (but so that it continues receiving advertisements from
      the DUT).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Inject a new set of LSAs from the generator toward the collector
      and the DUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On the collector, note the time the flooding is complete across
      the link to the generator.  Also note the time the flooding is
      complete across the link from the DUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The time from when the last LSA is received on the collector from the
   generator to when the last LSA is received on the collector from the
   DUT should be measured during this test.  This time is important in
   link state protocols, since the loop-free nature of the network is
   reliant on the speed at which revised topology information is
   flooded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Depending on the number of LSAs flooded, the sizes of the LSAs, the
   number of LSUs, and the rate of flooding, these numbers could vary by
   some amount.  The settings and variances of these numbers should be
   reported with the test results.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Shortest Path First Computation Time</h3></a>

   o  Use reference topology 1 (Emulated Topology), beginning with the
      DUT and the generator fully adjacent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The default SPF timer on the DUT should be set to 0 so that any
      new LSA that arrives immediately results in the SPF calculation
      [BLACKBOX].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The generator should inject a set of LSAs toward the DUT; the DUT
      should be allowed to converge and install all best paths in the
      local routing table, etc.
   o  Send an LSA that is already in the DUT (a duplicate LSA), note the
      time difference between when the LSA is sent and when the ack is
      received.  This measures the time taken to propagate the LSA and
      the ack, as well as the processing time of the duplicate LSA.
      This is dupLSAprocTime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Change the link cost between the generator and the emulated
      network it is advertising, and transmit the new LSA to the DUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Immediately inject another LSA that is a duplicate of some other
      LSA the generator has previously injected (preferably a stub
      network someplace within the emulated network).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note: The generator should make sure that outbound LSA packing is
      not performed for the duplicate LSAs and that they are always sent
      in a separate Link-state Update packet.  Otherwise, if the LSA
      carrying the topology change and the duplicate LSA are in the same
      packet, the SPF starts after the duplicate LSA is acked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Measure the time between transmitting the second (duplicate) LSA
      and the acknowledgement for that LSA; this is the totalSPFtime.
      The total time required to run SPF can be computed by subtracting
      dupLSAprocTime from totalSPFtime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The accuracy of this test is crucially dependent on the amount of
   time between the transmissions of the first and second LSAs.  If too
   much time elapsed, the test is meaningless because the SPF run will
   complete before the second (duplicate) LSA is received.  If the time
   elapsed is less, then both LSAs will be handled before the SPF run is
   scheduled and started, and thus the measurement would only be for the
   handling of the duplicate LSA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This test is also specified in [BLACKBOX].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note: This test may not be accurate on systems that implement OSPF as
   a multithreaded process, where the flooding takes place in a separate
   process (or on a different processor) than shortest path first
   computations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is also possible to measure the SPF time using white box tests
   (using output supplied by the OSPF software implementer), such as the
   following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Using reference topology 1 (Emulated Topology), establish a full
      adjacency between the generator and the DUT.
   o  Inject a set of LSAs from the generator toward the DUT.  Allow the
      DUT to stabilize and install all best paths in the routing table,
      etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Change the link cost between the DUT and the generator (or the
      link between the generator and the emulated network it is
      advertising), such that a full SPF is required to run, although
      only one piece of information is changed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Measure the amount of time required for the DUT to compute a new
      shortest path tree as a result of the topology changes injected by
      the generator.  These measurements should be taken using available
      show and debug information on the DUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Several caveats MUST be mentioned when a white box method of
   measuring SPF time is used.  For instance, such white box tests are
   only applicable when testing various versions or variations within a
   single implementation of the OSPF protocol.  Further, the same set of
   commands MUST be used in each iteration of such a test to ensure
   consistent results.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is an interesting relationship between the SPF times reported
   by white box (internal) testing and black box (external) testing;
   each of these two types of tests may be used as a "sanity check" on
   the other by comparing results.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   See [CONSIDERATIONS] for further discussion.

   to the broadcast network, and with varying sets of LSAs being
   advertised to the DUT from the routers attached to the broadcast
   network.  Variations in the LSA sets and other factors should be
   noted in the test results.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The time required to elect a designated router, as measured in
   Section 6.4, above, may be subtracted from the results of this test
   to provide just the convergence time across a broadcast network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that although all the other tests in this document include route
   calculation time in the convergence time, as described in [TERM],
   this test may not include route calculation time in the resulting
   measured convergence time, because initial route calculation may
   occur after the first network LSA is flooded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.6"><h3>6.6   Initial Convergence Time on a Broadcast Network, Test 2</h3></a>

   o  Using reference topology 3 (Broadcast Network), begin with the DUT
      connected to the network with OSPF enabled.  OSPF should be
      enabled on R1, but the broadcast link should be disabled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Enable the broadcast link between R1 and the DUT.  Note the time
      of the first hello transmitted by the DUT with a designated router
      listed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Note the time when the first network LSA is flooded by the DUT at
      R1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The time difference between the first hello with a designated
      router lists and the first network LSA is the period required by
      the DUT to converge on this new topology.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.7"><h3>6.7   Link Down with Layer 2 Detection</h3></a>

   o  Using reference topology 4 (Parallel Links), begin with OSPF in
      the Full state between the generator and the DUT.  Both links
      should be point-to-point links with the ability to notify the
      operating system immediately upon link failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Disable link 1; this should be done in such a way that the
      keepalive timers at the data link layer will have no impact on the
      DUT recognizing the link failure (the operating system in the DUT
      should recognize this link failure immediately).  Disconnecting
      the cable on the generator end would be one possibility; shutting
      the link down would be another.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Note the time of the link failure on the generator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  At the generator, note the time of the receipt of the new router
      LSA from the DUT notifying the generator of the link 2 failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The difference in the time between the initial link failure and
      the receipt of the LSA on the generator across link 2 should be
      taken as the time required for an OSPF implementation to recognize
      and process a link failure, including the time required to
      generate and flood an LSA describing the link down event to an
      adjacent neighbor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.8"><h3>6.8   Link Down with Layer 3 Detection</h3></a>

   o  Using reference topology 4 (Parallel Links), begin with OSPF in
      the Full state between the generator and the DUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Disable OSPF processing on link 1 from the generator.  This should
      be done in such a way that it does not affect link status; the DUT
      MUST note the failure of the adjacency through the dead interval.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  At the generator, note the time of the receipt of the new router
      LSA from the DUT notifying the generator of the link 2 failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The difference in the time between the initial link failure and the
   receipt of the LSA on the generator across link 2 should be taken as
   the time required for an OSPF implementation to recognize and process
   an adjacency failure.
