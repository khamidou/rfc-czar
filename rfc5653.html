      Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   offers application programmers uniform access to security services
   atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  This document
   updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in
   "Generic Security Service API Version 2 : Java Bindings" (RFC 2853).
   This document obsoletes RFC 2853 by making specific and incremental
   clarifications and corrections to it in response to identification of
   transcription errors and implementation experience.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level
   in "Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2,
   Update 1" (RFC 2743).  The GSS-API allows a caller application to
   authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and
   to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a
   per-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-
   API are "The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism" (RFC 2025) and "The
   Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program
   Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2" (RFC 4121).</h1>
                  <h2>Status of This Memo</h2>

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

   This document specifies Java language bindings for the Generic
   Security Services Application Programming Interface version 2 (GSS-
   API).  GSS-API version 2 is described in a language-independent
   format in RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE].  The GSS-API allows a caller
   application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights
   to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and
   integrity on a per-message basis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document and its predecessor, RFC 2853 [RFC2853], leverage the
   work done by the working group (WG) in the area of RFC 2743
   [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] and the C-bindings of RFC 2744 [GSSAPI-Cbind].
   Whenever appropriate, text has been used from the C-bindings document
   (RFC 2744) to explain generic concepts and provide direction to the
   implementors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The design goals of this API have been to satisfy all the
   functionality defined in RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] and to provide
   these services in an object-oriented method.  The specification also
   aims to satisfy the needs of both types of Java application
   developers, those who would like access to a "system-wide" GSS-API
   implementation, as well as those who would want to provide their own
   "custom" implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A system-wide implementation is one that is available to all
   applications in the form of a library package.  It may be the
   standard package in the Java runtime environment (JRE) being used or
   it may be additionally installed and accessible to any application
   via the CLASSPATH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A custom implementation of the GSS-API, on the other hand, is one
   that would, in most cases, be bundled with the application during
   distribution.  It is expected that such an implementation would be
   meant to provide for some particular need of the application, such as
   support for some specific mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The design of this API also aims to provide a flexible framework to
   add and manage GSS-API mechanisms.  GSS-API leverages the Java

   plugability of mechanisms.  Mechanisms can be added on a system-wide
   basis, where all users of the framework will have them available.
   The specification also allows for the addition of mechanisms per-
   instance of the GSS-API.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Lastly, this specification presents an API that will naturally fit
   within the operation environment of the Java platform.  Readers are
   assumed to be familiar with both the GSS-API and the Java platform.

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   GSS-API Operational Paradigm</h2></a>

   "Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface, Version
   2" [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] defines a generic security API to calling
   applications.  It allows a communicating application to authenticate
   the user associated with another application, to delegate rights to
   another application, and to apply security services such as
   confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are four stages to using GSS-API:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) The application acquires a set of credentials with which it may
      prove its identity to other processes.  The application's
      credentials vouch for its global identity, which may or may not be
      related to any local username under which it may be running.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) A pair of communicating applications establish a joint security
      context using their credentials.  The security context
      encapsulates shared state information, which is required in order
      that per-message security services may be provided.  Examples of
      state information that might be shared between applications as
      part of a security context are cryptographic keys and message
      sequence numbers.  As part of the establishment of a security
      context, the context initiator is authenticated to the responder,
      and may require that the responder is authenticated back to the
      initiator.  The initiator may optionally give the responder the
      right to initiate further security contexts, acting as an agent or
      delegate of the initiator.  This transfer of rights is termed
      "delegation", and is achieved by creating a set of credentials,
      similar to those used by the initiating application, but which may
      be used by the responder.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A GSSContext object is used to establish and maintain the shared
      information that makes up the security context.  Certain
      GSSContext methods will generate a token, which applications treat
      as cryptographically protected, opaque data.  The caller of such a
      GSSContext method is responsible for transferring the token to the
      peer application, encapsulated if necessary in an application-to-
      application protocol.  On receipt of such a token, the peer
      application should pass it to a corresponding GSSContext method
      which will decode the token and extract the information, updating
      the security context state information accordingly.
   3) Per-message services are invoked on a GSSContext object to apply
      either:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      integrity and data origin authentication, or

      confidentiality, integrity and data origin authentication

      to application data, which are treated by GSS-API as arbitrary
      octet-strings.  An application transmitting a message that it
      wishes to protect will call the appropriate GSSContext method
      (getMIC or wrap) to apply protection, and send the resulting token
      to the receiving application.  The receiver will pass the received
      token (and, in the case of data protected by getMIC, the
      accompanying message-data) to the corresponding decoding method of
      the GSSContext interface (verifyMIC or unwrap) to remove the
      protection and validate the data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4) At the completion of a communications session (which may extend
      across several transport connections), each application uses a
      GSSContext method to invalidate the security context and release
      any system or cryptographic resources held.  Multiple contexts may
      also be used (either successively or simultaneously) within a
      single communications association, at the discretion of the
      applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Additional Controls</h2></a>

   This section discusses the optional services that a context initiator
   may request of the GSS-API before the context establishment.  Each of
   these services is requested by calling the appropriate mutator method
   in the GSSContext object before the first call to init is performed.
   Only the context initiator can request context flags.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The optional services defined are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Delegation: The (usually temporary) transfer of rights from
      initiator to acceptor, enabling the acceptor to authenticate
      itself as an agent of the initiator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Mutual Authentication: In addition to the initiator authenticating
      its identity to the context acceptor, the context acceptor should
      also authenticate itself to the initiator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Replay Detection: In addition to providing message integrity
      services, GSSContext per-message operations of getMIC and wrap
      should include message numbering information to enable verifyMIC
      and unwrap to detect if a message has been duplicated.
      Out-of-Sequence Detection: In addition to providing message
      integrity services, GSSContext per-message operations (getMIC and
      wrap) should include message sequencing information to enable
      verifyMIC and unwrap to detect if a message has been received out
      of sequence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Anonymous Authentication: The establishment of the security
      context should not reveal the initiator's identity to the context
      acceptor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some mechanisms may not support all optional services, and some
   mechanisms may only support some services in conjunction with others.
   The GSSContext interface offers query methods to allow the
   verification by the calling application of which services will be
   available from the context when the establishment phase is complete.
   In general, if the security mechanism is capable of providing a
   requested service, it should do so even if additional services must
   be enabled in order to provide the requested service.  If the
   mechanism is incapable of providing a requested service, it should
   proceed without the service leaving the application to abort the
   context establishment process if it considers the requested service
   to be mandatory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some mechanisms may specify that support for some services is
   optional, and that implementors of the mechanism need not provide it.
   This is most commonly true of the confidentiality service, often
   because of legal restrictions on the use of data-encryption, but may
   apply to any of the services.  Such mechanisms are required to send
   at least one token from acceptor to initiator during context
   establishment when the initiator indicates a desire to use such a
   service, so that the initiating GSS-API can correctly indicate
   whether the service is supported by the acceptor's GSS-API.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Delegation</h3></a>

   The GSS-API allows delegation to be controlled by the initiating
   application via the requestCredDeleg method before the first call to
   init has been issued.  Some mechanisms do not support delegation, and
   for such mechanisms, attempts by an application to enable delegation
   are ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The acceptor of a security context, for which the initiator enabled
   delegation, can check if delegation was enabled by using the
   getCredDelegState method of the GSSContext interface.  In cases when
   it is enabled, the delegated credential object can be obtained by
   calling the getDelegCred method.  The obtained GSSCredential object
   may then be used to initiate subsequent GSS-API security contexts as
   an agent or delegate of the initiator.  If the original initiator's
   identity is "A" and the delegate's identity is "B", then, depending
   on the underlying mechanism, the identity embodied by the delegated
   credential may be either "A" or "B acting for A".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For many mechanisms that support delegation, a simple boolean does
   not provide enough control.  Examples of additional aspects of
   delegation control that a mechanism might provide to an application
   are duration of delegation, network addresses from which delegation
   is valid, and constraints on the tasks that may be performed by a
   delegate.  Such controls are presently outside the scope of the GSS-
   API.  GSS-API implementations supporting mechanisms offering
   additional controls should provide extension routines that allow
   these controls to be exercised (perhaps by modifying the initiator's
   GSS-API credential object prior to its use in establishing a
   context).  However, the simple delegation control provided by GSS-API
   should always be able to override other mechanism-specific delegation
   controls.  If the application instructs the GSSContext object that
   delegation is not desired, then the implementation must not permit
   delegation to occur.  This is an exception to the general rule that a
   mechanism may enable services even if they are not requested --
   delegation may only be provided at the explicit request of the
   application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Mutual Authentication</h3></a>

   Usually, a context acceptor will require that a context initiator
   authenticate itself so that the acceptor may make an access-control
   decision prior to performing a service for the initiator.  In some
   cases, the initiator may also request that the acceptor authenticate
   itself.  GSS-API allows the initiating application to request this
   mutual authentication service by calling the requestMutualAuth method
   of the GSSContext interface with a "true" parameter before making the
   first call to init.  The initiating application is informed as to
   whether or not the context acceptor has authenticated itself.  Note
   that some mechanisms may not support mutual authentication, and other
   mechanisms may always perform mutual authentication, whether or not
   the initiating application requests it.  In particular, mutual
   authentication may be required by some mechanisms in order to support
   replay or out-of-sequence message detection, and for such mechanisms,
   a request for either of these services will automatically enable
   mutual authentication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Replay and Out-of-Sequence Detection</h3></a>

   The GSS-API may provide detection of mis-ordered messages once a
   security context has been established.  Protection may be applied to
   messages by either application, by calling either getMIC or wrap
   methods of the GSSContext interface, and verified by the peer
   application by calling verifyMIC or unwrap for the peer's GSSContext
   object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The getMIC method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an
   application message, and returns that checksum in a token.  The
   application should pass both the token and the message to the peer
   application, which presents them to the verifyMIC method of the
   peer's GSSContext object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The wrap method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an application
   message, and places both the checksum and the message inside a single
   token.  The application should pass the token to the peer
   application, which presents it to the unwrap method of the peer's
   GSSContext object to extract the message and verify the checksum.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Either pair of routines may be capable of detecting out-of-sequence
   message delivery or the duplication of messages.  Details of such
   mis-ordered messages are indicated through supplementary query
   methods of the MessageProp object that is filled in by each of these
   routines.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A mechanism need not maintain a list of all tokens that have been
   processed in order to support these status codes.  A typical
   mechanism might retain information about only the most recent "N"
   tokens processed, allowing it to distinguish duplicates and missing
   tokens within the most recent "N" messages; the receipt of a token
   older than the most recent "N" would result in the isOldToken method
   of the instance of MessageProp to return "true".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Anonymous Authentication</h3></a>

   In certain situations, an application may wish to initiate the
   authentication process to authenticate a peer, without revealing its
   own identity.  As an example, consider an application providing
   access to a database containing medical information and offering
   unrestricted access to the service.  A client of such a service might
   wish to authenticate the service (in order to establish trust in any
   information retrieved from it), but might not wish the service to be
   able to obtain the client's identity (perhaps due to privacy concerns
   about the specific inquiries, or perhaps simply to avoid being placed
   on mailing-lists).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In normal use of the GSS-API, the initiator's identity is made
   available to the acceptor as a result of the context establishment
   process.  However, context initiators may request that their identity
   not be revealed to the context acceptor.  Many mechanisms do not
   support anonymous authentication, and for such mechanisms, the
   request will not be honored.  An authentication token will still be
   generated, but the application is always informed if a requested
   service is unavailable, and has the option to abort context
   establishment if anonymity is valued above the other security
   services that would require a context to be established.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to informing the application that a context is
   established anonymously (via the isAnonymous method of the GSSContext
   class), the getSrcName method of the acceptor's GSSContext object
   will, for such contexts, return a reserved internal-form name,
   defined by the implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The toString method for a GSSName object representing an anonymous
   entity will return a printable name.  The returned value will be
   syntactically distinguishable from any valid principal name supported
   by the implementation.  The associated name-type object identifier
   will be an oid representing the value of NT_ANONYMOUS.  This name-
   type oid will be defined as a public, static Oid object of the
   GSSName class.  The printable form of an anonymous name should be
   chosen such that it implies anonymity, since this name may appear in,
   for example, audit logs.  For example, the string "<anonymous>" might
   be a good choice, if no valid printable names supported by the
   implementation can begin with "<" and end with ">".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using the equal method of the GSSName interface, and one of the
   operands is a GSSName instance representing an anonymous entity, the
   method must return "false".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Confidentiality</h3></a>

   If a GSSContext supports the confidentiality service, wrap method may
   be used to encrypt application messages.  Messages are selectively
   encrypted, under the control of the setPrivacy method of the
   MessageProp object used in the wrap method.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   Inter-process Context Transfer</h3></a>

   GSS-APIv2 provides functionality that allows a security context to be
   transferred between processes on a single machine.  These are
   implemented using the export method of GSSContext and a byte array
   constructor of the same class.  The most common use for such a
   feature is a client-server design where the server is implemented as
   a single process that accepts incoming security contexts, which then
   launches child processes to deal with the data on these contexts.  In
   such a design, the child processes must have access to the security
   context object created within the parent so that they can use per-
   message protection services and delete the security context when the
   communication session ends.
   Since the security context data structure is expected to contain
   sequencing information, it is impractical in general to share a
   context between processes.  Thus, the GSSContext interface provides
   an export method that the process, which currently owns the context,
   can call to declare that it has no intention to use the context
   subsequently, and to create an inter-process token containing
   information needed by the adopting process to successfully recreate
   the context.  After successful completion of export, the original
   security context is made inaccessible to the calling process by GSS-
   API, and any further usage of this object will result in failures.
   The originating process transfers the inter-process token to the
   adopting process, which creates a new GSSContext object using the
   byte array constructor.  The properties of the context are equivalent
   to that of the original context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The inter-process token may contain sensitive data from the original
   security context (including cryptographic keys).  Applications using
   inter-process tokens to transfer security contexts must take
   appropriate steps to protect these tokens in transit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
   transfer of security contexts.  Calling the isTransferable method of
   the GSSContext interface will indicate if the context object is
   transferable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.7"><h3>4.7   The Use of Incomplete Contexts</h3></a>

   Some mechanisms may allow the per-message services to be used before
   the context establishment process is complete.  For example, a
   mechanism may include sufficient information in its initial context-
   level tokens for the context acceptor to immediately decode messages
   protected with wrap or getMIC.  For such a mechanism, the initiating
   application need not wait until subsequent context-level tokens have
   been sent and received before invoking the per-message protection
   services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An application can invoke the isProtReady method of the GSSContext
   class to determine if the per-message services are available in
   advance of complete context establishment.  Applications wishing to
   use per-message protection services on partially established contexts
   should query this method before attempting to invoke wrap or getMIC.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Calling Conventions</h2></a>

   Java provides the implementors with not just a syntax for the
   language, but also an operational environment.  For example, memory
   is automatically managed and does not require application
   intervention.  These language features have allowed for a simpler API
   and have led to the elimination of certain GSS-API functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Moreover, the JCA defines a provider model that allows for
   implementation-independent access to security services.  Using this
   model, applications can seamlessly switch between different
   implementations and dynamically add new services.  The GSS-API
   specification leverages these concepts by the usage of providers for
   the mechanism implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Package Name</h3></a>

   The classes and interfaces defined in this document reside in the
   package called "org.ietf.jgss".  Applications that wish to make use
   of this API should import this package name as shown in section 8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Provider Framework</h3></a>

   The Java security API's use a provider architecture that allows
   applications to be implementation independent and security API
   implementations to be modular and extensible.  The
   java.security.Provider class is an abstract class that a vendor
   extends.  This class maps various properties that represent different
   security services that are available to the names of the actual
   vendor classes that implement those services.  When requesting a
   service, an application simply specifies the desired provider and the
   API delegates the request to service classes available from that
   provider.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Using the Java security provider model insulates applications from
   implementation details of the services they wish to use.
   Applications can switch between providers easily and new providers
   can be added as needed, even at runtime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GSS-API may use providers to find components for specific
   underlying security mechanisms.  For instance, a particular provider
   might contain components that will allow the GSS-API to support the
   Kerberos v5 mechanism [RFC4121] and another might contain components
   to support the Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM) [RFC2025].
   By delegating mechanism-specific functionality to the components
   obtained from providers, the GSS-API can be extended to support an
   arbitrary list of mechanism.
   How the GSS-API locates and queries these providers is beyond the
   scope of this document and is being deferred to a Service Provider
   Interface (SPI) specification.  The availability of such an SPI
   specification is not mandatory for the adoption of this API
   specification nor is it mandatory to use providers in the
   implementation of a GSS-API framework.  However, by using the
   provider framework together with an SPI specification, one can create
   an extensible and implementation-independent GSS-API framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Integer Types</h3></a>

   All numeric values are declared as "int" primitive Java type.  The
   Java specification guarantees that this will be a 32-bit two's
   complement signed number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Throughout this API, the "boolean" primitive Java type is used
   wherever a boolean value is required or returned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   Opaque Data Types</h3></a>

   Java byte arrays are used to represent opaque data types that are
   consumed and produced by the GSS-API in the form of tokens.  Java
   arrays contain a length field that enables the users to easily
   determine their size.  The language has automatic garbage collection
   that alleviates the need by developers to release memory and
   simplifies buffer ownership issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   Strings</h3></a>

   The String object will be used to represent all textual data.  The
   Java String object transparently treats all characters as two-byte
   Unicode characters, which allows support for many locals.  All
   routines returning or accepting textual data will use the String
   object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6   Object Identifiers</h3></a>

   An Oid object will be used to represent Universal Object Identifiers
   (Oids).  Oids are ISO-defined, hierarchically globally interpretable
   identifiers used within the GSS-API framework to identify security
   mechanisms and name formats.  The Oid object can be created from a
   string representation of its dot notation (e.g., "1.3.6.1.5.6.2") as
   well as from its ASN.1 DER encoding.  Methods are also provided to
   test equality and provide the DER representation for the object.
   An important feature of the Oid class is that its instances are
   immutable -- i.e., there are no methods defined that allow one to
   change the contents of an Oid.  This property allows one to treat
   these objects as "statics" without the need to perform copies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Certain routines allow the usage of a default oid.  A "null" value
   can be used in those cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.7"><h3>5.7   Object Identifier Sets</h3></a>

   The Java bindings represent object identifier sets as arrays of Oid
   objects.  All Java arrays contain a length field, which allows for
   easy manipulation and reference.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to support the full functionality of RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-
   UPDATE], the Oid class includes a method that checks for existence of
   an Oid object within a specified array.  This is equivalent in
   functionality to gss_test_oid_set_member.  The use of Java arrays and
   Java's automatic garbage collection has eliminated the need for the
   following routines: gss_create_empty_oid_set, gss_release_oid_set,
   and gss_add_oid_set_member.  Java GSS-API implementations will not
   contain them.  Java's automatic garbage collection and the immutable
   property of the Oid object eliminates the memory management issues of
   the C counterpart.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Whenever a default value for an Object Identifier Set is required, a
   "null" value can be used.  Please consult the detailed method
   description for details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.8"><h3>5.8   Credentials</h3></a>

   GSS-API credentials are represented by the GSSCredential interface.
   The interface contains several constructs to allow for the creation
   of most common credential objects for the initiator and the acceptor.
   Comparisons are performed using the interface's "equals" method.  The
   following general description of GSS-API credentials is included from
   the C-bindings specification:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      GSS-API credentials can contain mechanism-specific principal
      authentication data for multiple mechanisms.  A GSS-API credential
      is composed of a set of credential-elements, each of which is
      applicable to a single mechanism.  A credential may contain at
      most one credential-element for each supported mechanism.  A
      credential-element identifies the data needed by a single
      mechanism to authenticate a single principal, and conceptually
      contains two credential-references that describe the actual
      mechanism-specific authentication data, one to be used by GSS-API
      for initiating contexts, and one to be used for accepting
      contexts.  For mechanisms that do not distinguish between acceptor
      and initiator credentials, both references would point to the same
      underlying mechanism-specific authentication data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Credentials describe a set of mechanism-specific principals, and give
   their holder the ability to act as any of those principals.  All
   principal identities asserted by a single GSS-API credential should
   belong to the same entity, although enforcement of this property is

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.9"><h3>5.9   Contexts</h3></a>

   The GSSContext interface is used to represent one end of a GSS-API
   security context, storing state information appropriate to that end
   of the peer communication, including cryptographic state information.
   The instantiation of the context object is done differently by the
   initiator and the acceptor.  After the context has been instantiated,
   the initiator may choose to set various context options that will
   determine the characteristics of the desired security context.  When
   all the application-desired characteristics have been set, the
   initiator will call the initSecContext method, which will produce a
   token for consumption by the peer's acceptSecContext method.  It is
   the responsibility of the application to deliver the authentication
   token(s) between the peer applications for processing.  Upon
   completion of the context-establishment phase, context attributes can
   be retrieved, by both the initiator and acceptor, using the accessor
   methods.  These will reflect the actual attributes of the established
   context.  At this point, the context can be used by the application
   to apply cryptographic services to its data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.10"><h3>5.10   Authentication Tokens</h3></a>

   A token is a caller-opaque type that GSS-API uses to maintain
   synchronization between each end of the GSS-API security context.
   The token is a cryptographically protected octet-string, generated by
   the underlying mechanism at one end of a GSS-API security context for
   use by the peer mechanism at the other end.  Encapsulation (if
   required) within the application protocol and transfer of the token
   are the responsibility of the peer applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Java GSS-API uses byte arrays to represent authentication tokens.
   Overloaded methods exist that allow the caller to supply input and
   output streams that will be used for the reading and writing of the
   token data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.11"><h3>5.11   Inter-Process Tokens</h3></a>

   Certain GSS-API routines are intended to transfer data between
   processes in multi-process programs.  These routines use a caller-
   opaque octet-string, generated by the GSS-API in one process for use
   by the GSS-API in another process.  The calling application is
   responsible for transferring such tokens between processes.  Note
   that, while GSS-API implementors are encouraged to avoid placing
   sensitive information within inter-process tokens, or to
   cryptographically protect them, many implementations will be unable
   to avoid placing key material or other sensitive data within them.
   It is the application's responsibility to ensure that inter-process
   tokens are protected in transit, and transferred only to processes
   that are trustworthy.  An inter-process token is represented using a
   byte array emitted from the export method of the GSSContext
   interface.  The receiver of the inter-process token would initialize
   an GSSContext object with this token to create a new context.  Once a
   context has been exported, the GSSContext object is invalidated and
   is no longer available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.12"><h3>5.12   Error Reporting</h3></a>

   RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] defined the usage of major and minor
   status values for the signaling of GSS-API errors.  The major code,
   also called GSS status code, is used to signal errors at the GSS-API
   level, independent of the underlying mechanism(s).  The minor status
   value or Mechanism status code, is a mechanism-defined error value
   indicating a mechanism-specific error code.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Java GSS-API uses exceptions implemented by the GSSException class to
   signal both minor and major error values.  Both mechanism-specific
   errors and GSS-API level errors are signaled through instances of
   this class.  The usage of exceptions replaces the need for major and
   minor codes to be used within the API calls.  The GSSException class
   also contains methods to obtain textual representations for both the
   major and minor values, which is equivalent to the functionality of
   gss_display_status.
	<a name="section-5.12.1"><h4>5.12.1   GSS Status Codes</h4></a>

   GSS status codes indicate errors that are independent of the
   underlying mechanism(s) used to provide the security service.  The
   errors that can be indicated via a GSS status code are generic API
   routine errors (errors that are defined in the GSS-API
   specification).  These bindings take advantage of the Java exceptions
   mechanism, thus, eliminating the need for calling errors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A GSS status code indicates a single fatal generic API error from the
   routine that has thrown the GSSException.  Using exceptions announces
   that a fatal error has occurred during the execution of the method.
   The GSS-API operational model also allows for the signaling of
   supplementary status information from the per-message calls.  These
   need to be handled as return values since using exceptions is not
   appropriate for informatory or warning-like information.  The methods
   that are capable of producing supplementary information are the two
   per-message methods GSSContext.verifyMIC() and GSSContext.unwrap().
   These methods fill the supplementary status codes in the MessageProp

   A name is used to identify a person or entity.  GSS-API authenticates
   the relationship between a name and the entity claiming the name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since different authentication mechanisms may employ different
   namespaces for identifying their principals, GSS-API's naming support
   is necessarily complex in multi-mechanism environments (or even in
   some single-mechanism environments where the underlying mechanism
   supports multiple namespaces).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two distinct conceptual representations are defined for names:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) A GSS-API form represented by implementations of the GSSName
      interface: A single GSSName object may contain multiple names from
      different namespaces, but all names should refer to the same
      entity.  An example of such an internal name would be the name
      returned from a call to the getName method of the GSSCredential
      interface, when applied to a credential containing credential
      elements for multiple authentication mechanisms employing
      different namespaces.  This GSSName object will contain a distinct
      name for the entity for each authentication mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For GSS-API implementations supporting multiple namespaces,
      GSSName implementations must contain sufficient information to
      determine the namespace to which each primitive name belongs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) Mechanism-specific contiguous byte array and string forms:
      Different GSSName initialization methods are provided to handle
      both byte array and string formats and to accommodate various
      calling applications and name types.  These formats are capable of
      containing only a single name (from a single namespace).
      Contiguous string names are always accompanied by an object
      identifier specifying the namespace to which the name belongs, and
      their format is dependent on the authentication mechanism that
      employs that name.  The string name forms are assumed to be
      printable, and may therefore be used by GSS-API applications for
      communication with their users.  The byte array name formats are
      assumed to be in non-printable formats (e.g., the byte array
      returned from the export method of the GSSName interface).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A GSSName object can be converted to a contiguous representation by
   using the toString method.  This will guarantee that the name will be
   converted to a printable format.  Different initialization methods in
   the GSSName interface are defined allowing support for multiple
   syntaxes for each supported namespace, and allowing users the freedom
   to choose a preferred name representation.  The toString method
   should use an implementation-chosen printable syntax for each
   supported name type.  To obtain the printable name type,
   getStringNameType method can be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no guarantee that calling the toString method on the GSSName
   interface will produce the same string form as the original imported
   string name.  Furthermore, it is possible that the name was not even
   constructed from a string representation.  The same applies to
   namespace identifiers, which may not necessarily survive unchanged
   after a journey through the internal name form.  An example of this
   might be a mechanism that authenticates X.500 names, but provides an
   algorithmic mapping of Internet DNS names into X.500.  That
   mechanism's implementation of GSSName might, when presented with a
   DNS name, generate an internal name that contained both the original
   DNS name and the equivalent X.500 name.  Alternatively, it might only
   store the X.500 name.  In the latter case, the toString method of
   GSSName would most likely generate a printable X.500 name, rather
   than the original DNS name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The context acceptor can obtain a GSSName object representing the
   entity performing the context initiation (through the usage of
   getSrcName method).  Since this name has been authenticated by a
   single mechanism, it contains only a single name (even if the
   internal name presented by the context initiator to the GSSContext
   object had multiple components).  Such names are termed internal-
   mechanism names (or MNs), and the names emitted by GSSContext
   interface in the getSrcName and getTargName are always of this type.
   Since some applications may require MNs without wanting to incur the
   overhead of an authentication operation, creation methods are
   provided that take not only the name buffer and name type, but also
   the mechanism oid for which this name should be created.  When
   dealing with an existing GSSName object, the canonicalize method may
   be invoked to convert a general internal name into an MN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GSSName objects can be compared using their equal method, which
   returns "true" if the two names being compared refer to the same
   entity.  This is the preferred way to perform name comparisons
   instead of using the printable names that a given GSS-API
   implementation may support.  Since GSS-API assumes that all primitive
   names contained within a given internal name refer to the same
   entity, equal can return "true" if the two names have at least one
   primitive name in common.  If the implementation embodies knowledge
   of equivalence relationships between names taken from different
   namespaces, this knowledge may also allow successful comparisons of
   internal names containing no overlapping primitive elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When used in large access control lists, the overhead of creating a
   GSSName object on each name and invoking the equal method on each
   name from the Access Control List (ACL) may be prohibitive.  As an
   alternative way of supporting this case, GSS-API defines a special
   form of the contiguous byte array name, which may be compared
   directly (byte by byte).  Contiguous names suitable for comparison
   are generated by the export method.  Exported names may be re-
   imported by using the byte array constructor and specifying the
   NT_EXPORT_NAME as the name type object identifier.  The resulting
   GSSName name will also be a MN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GSSName interface defines public static Oid objects representing
   the standard name types.  Structurally, an exported name object
   consists of a header containing an OID identifying the mechanism that
   authenticated the name, and a trailer containing the name itself,
   where the syntax of the trailer is defined by the individual
   mechanism specification.  Detailed description of the format is
   specified in the language-independent GSS-API specification
   [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the results obtained by using the equals method will in
   general be different from those obtained by invoking canonicalize and
   export, and then comparing the byte array output.  The first series
   of operation determines whether two (unauthenticated) names identify
   the same principal; the second whether a particular mechanism would
   authenticate them as the same principal.  These two operations will
   in general give the same results only for MNs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is important to note that the above are guidelines as to how
   GSSName implementations should behave, and are not intended to be
   specific requirements of how name objects must be implemented.  The
   mechanism designers are free to decide on the details of their
   implementations of the GSSName interface as long as the behavior
   satisfies the above guidelines.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.14"><h3>5.14   Channel Bindings</h3></a>

   GSS-API supports the use of user-specified tags to identify a given
   context to the peer application.  These tags are intended to be used
   to identify the particular communications channel that carries the
   context.  Channel bindings are communicated to the GSS-API using the
   ChannelBinding object.  The application may use byte arrays to
   specify the application data to be used in the channel binding as
   well as using instances of the InetAddress.  The InetAddress for the
   initiator and/or acceptor can be used within an instance of a
   ChannelBinding.  ChannelBinding can be set for the GSSContext object
   using the setChannelBinding method before the first call to init or
   accept has been performed.  Unless the setChannelBinding method has
   been used to set the ChannelBinding for a GSSContext object, "null"
   ChannelBinding will be assumed.  InetAddress is currently the only
   address type defined within the Java platform and as such, it is the
   only one supported within the ChannelBinding class.  Applications
   that use other types of addresses can include them as part of the
   application-specific data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Conceptually, the GSS-API concatenates the initiator and acceptor
   address information, and the application-supplied byte array to form
   an octet-string.  The mechanism calculates a Message Integrity Code
   (MIC) over this octet-string and binds the MIC to the context
   establishment token emitted by the init method of the GSSContext
   interface.  The same bindings are set by the context acceptor for its
   GSSContext object and during processing of the accept method, a MIC
   is calculated in the same way.  The calculated MIC is compared with
   that found in the token, and if the MICs differ, accept will throw a
   GSSException with the major code set to BAD_BINDINGS, and the context
   will not be established.  Some mechanisms may include the actual
   channel binding data in the token (rather than just a MIC);
   applications should therefore not use confidential data as channel-
   binding components.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Individual mechanisms may impose additional constraints on addresses
   that may appear in channel bindings.  For example, a mechanism may
   verify that the initiator address field of the channel binding
   contains the correct network address of the host system.  Portable
   applications should therefore ensure that they either provide correct
   information for the address fields, or omit the setting of the
   addressing information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.15"><h3>5.15   Stream Objects</h3></a>

   The context object provides overloaded methods that use input and
   output streams as the means to convey authentication and per-message
   GSS-API tokens.  It is important to note that the streams are
   expected to contain the usual GSS-API tokens, which would otherwise
   be handled through the usage of byte arrays.  The tokens are expected
   to have a definite start and an end.  The callers are responsible for
   ensuring that the supplied streams will not block, or expect to block
   until a full token is processed by the GSS-API method.  Only a single
   GSS-API token will be processed per invocation of the stream-based
   method.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The usage of streams allows the callers to have control and
   management of the supplied buffers.  Because streams are non-
   primitive objects, the callers can make the streams as complicated or
   as simple as desired simply by using the streams defined in the
   java.io package or creating their own through the use of inheritance.
   This will allow for the application's greatest flexibility.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.16"><h3>5.16   Optional Parameters</h3></a>

   GSS becomes part of the standard Java APIs, then these classes will
   be available by default on all systems as part of the JRE's system
   classes.

	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Detailed GSS-API Class Description</h2></a>

   This section lists a detailed description of all the public methods
   that each of the GSS-API classes and interfaces must provide.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   public abstract class GSSManager</h3></a>

   The GSSManager class is an abstract class that serves as a factory
   for three GSS interfaces: GSSName, GSSCredential, and GSSContext.  It
   also provides methods for applications to determine what mechanisms
   are available from the GSS implementation and what name types these
   mechanisms support.  An instance of the default GSSManager subclass
   may be obtained through the static method getInstance(), but
   applications are free to instantiate other subclasses of GSSManager.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All but one method in this class are declared abstract.  This means
   that subclasses have to provide the complete implementation for those
   methods.  The only exception to this is the static method
   getInstance(), which will have platform-specific code to return an
   instance of the default subclass.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Platform providers of GSS are required not to add any constructors to
   this class, private, public, or protected.  This will ensure that all
   subclasses invoke only the default constructor provided to the base
   class by the compiler.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A subclass extending the GSSManager abstract class may be implemented
   as a modular provider-based layer that utilizes some well-known
   service provider specification.  The GSSManager API provides the
   application with methods to set provider preferences on such an
   implementation.  These methods also allow the implementation to throw
   a well-defined exception in case provider-based configuration is not
   supported.  Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
   of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
   providers will be used:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) The application does not care about what provider is used (the
      default case).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) The application wants a particular provider to be used
      preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the time,
      irrespective of the mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3) The application wants to use the locally configured providers as
      far as possible, but if support is missing for one or more
      mechanisms, then it wants to fall back on its own provider.
   The GSSManager class has two methods that enable these modes of
   usage: addProviderAtFront() and addProviderAtEnd().  These methods
   have the effect of creating an ordered list of <provider, oid> pairs
   where each pair indicates a preference of provider for a given oid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of these methods does not require any knowledge of whatever
   service provider specification the GSSManager subclass follows.  It
   is hoped that these methods will serve the needs of most
   applications.  Additional methods may be added to an extended
   GSSManager that could be part of a service provider specification
   that is standardized later.

   This interface encapsulates the GSS-API security context and provides
   the security services (wrap, unwrap, getMIC, verifyMIC) that are
   available over the context.  Security contexts are established
   between peers using locally acquired credentials.  Multiple contexts
   may exist simultaneously between a pair of peers, using the same or
   different set of credentials.  GSS-API functions in a manner
   independent of the underlying transport protocol and depends on its
   calling application to transport its tokens between peers.
   Before the context establishment phase is initiated, the context
   initiator may request specific characteristics desired of the
   established context.  These can be set using the set methods.  After
   the context is established, the caller can check the actual
   characteristic and services offered by the context using the query
   methods.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The context establishment phase begins with the first call to the
   init method by the context initiator.  During this phase, the
   initSecContext and acceptSecContext methods will produce GSS-API
   authentication tokens, which the calling application needs to send to
   its peer.  If an error occurs at any point, an exception will get
   thrown and the code will start executing in a catch block.  If not,
   the normal flow of code continues and the application can make a call
   to the isEstablished() method.  If this method returns "false" it
   indicates that a token is needed from its peer in order to continue
   the context establishment phase.  A return value of "true" signals
   that the local end of the context is established.  This may still
   require that a token be sent to the peer, if one is produced by GSS-
   API.  During the context establishment phase, the isProtReady()
   method may be called to determine if the context can be used for the
   per-message operations.  This allows applications to use per-message
   operations on contexts that aren't fully established.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After the context has been established or the isProtReady() method
   returns "true", the query routines can be invoked to determine the
   actual characteristics and services of the established context.  The
   application can also start using the per-message methods of wrap and
   getMIC to obtain cryptographic operations on application supplied
   data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the context is no longer needed, the application should call
   dispose to release any system resources the context may be using.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This method deactivates the security context and creates an inter-
   process token which, when passed to the byte array constructor of the
   GSSContext interface in another process, will re-activate the context
   in the second process.  Only a single instantiation of a given
   context may be active at any one time; a subsequent attempt by a
   context exporter to access the exported security context will fail.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The implementation may constrain the set of processes by which the

   security policy, or as a result of implementation decisions.  For

   only between processes that run under the same account, or which are
   part of the same process group.

	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The Java language security model allows platform providers to have
   policy-based fine-grained access control over any resource that an
   application wants.  When using a Java security manager (such as, but
   not limited to, the case of applets running in browsers) the
   application code is in a sandbox by default.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Administrators of the platform JRE determine what permissions, if
   any, are to be given to source from different codebases.  Thus, the
   administrator has to be aware of any special requirements that the
   GSS provider might have for system resources.  For instance, a
   Kerberos provider might wish to make a network connection to the Key
   Distribution Center (KDC) to obtain initial credentials.  This would
   not be allowed under the sandbox unless the administrator had granted
   permissions for this.  Also, note that this granting and checking of
   permissions happens transparently to the application and is outside
   the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Java language allows administrators to pre-configure a list of
   security service providers in the <JRE>/lib/security/java.security
   file.  At runtime, the system approaches these providers in order of
   preference when looking for security related services.  Applications
   have a means to modify this list through methods in the "Security"
   class in the "java.security" package.  However, since these
   modifications would be visible in the entire Java Virtual Machine
   (JVM) and thus affect all code executing in it, this operation is not
   available in the sandbox and requires special permissions to perform.
   Thus, when a GSS application has special needs that are met by a
   particular security provider, it has two choices:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) To install the provider on a JVM-wide basis using the
      java.security.Security class and then depend on the system to find
      the right provider automatically when the need arises.  (This
      would require the application to be granted a "insertProvider
      SecurityPermission".)

   2) To pass an instance of the provider to the local instance of
      GSSManager so that only factory calls going through that
      GSSManager use the desired provider.  (This would not require any
      permissions.)

   This proposed API leverages earlier work performed by the IETF's CAT
   WG as outlined in both RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] and RFC 2744
   [GSSAPI-Cbind].  Many conceptual definitions, implementation
   directions, and explanations have been included from these documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   Changes since RFC 2853</h2></a>

   This document has following changes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) Major GSS Status Code Constant Values

      RFC 2853 listed all the GSS status code values in two different
      sections: section 4.12.1 defined numeric values for them, and
      section 6.8.1 defined them as static constants in the GSSException
      class without assigning any values.  Due to an inconsistent
      ordering between these two sections, all of the GSS major status
      codes resulted in misalignment, and a subsequent disagreement
      between deployed implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This document defines the numeric values of the GSS status codes
      in both sections, while maintaining the original ordering from
      section 6.8.1 of RFC 2853 [RFC2853], and obsoletes the GSS status
      code values defined in section 4.12.1.  The relevant sections in
      this document are sections 5.12.1 and 7.8.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) GSS Credential Usage Constant Values

      RFC 2853 section 6.3.2 defines static constants for the
      GSSCredential usage flags.  However, the values of these constants
      were not defined anywhere in RFC 2853 [RFC2853].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This document defines the credential usage values in section
<a href="#section-7.3.2" class="indent-2">7.3.2. The original ordering of these values from section 6.3</a><br>
      of RFC 2853 [RFC2853] is maintained.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3) GSS Host-Based Service Name

      RFC 2853 [RFC2853], section 6.2.2, defines the static constant for
      the GSS host-based service OID NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE, using a
      deprecated OID value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This document updates the NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE OID value in
      section 7.2.2 to be consistent with the C-bindings in RFC 2744
      [GSSAPI-Cbind].
