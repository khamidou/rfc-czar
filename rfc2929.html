	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides replicated distributed secure
   hierarchical databases which hierarchically store "resource records"
   (RRs) under domain names.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This data is structured into CLASSes and zones which can be
   independently maintained.  See [RFC 1034, 1035, 2136, 2181, 2535]
   familiarity with which is assumed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document covers, either directly or by reference, general IANA
   parameter assignment considerations applying across DNS query and
   response headers and all RRs.  There may be additional IANA
   considerations that apply to only a particular RR type or
   query/response opcode.  See the specific RFC defining that RR type or
   query/response opcode for such considerations if they have been
   defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IANA currently maintains a web page of DNS parameters.  See
   <http://www.iana.org/numbers.htm>.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "IETF Standards Action", "IETF Consensus", "Specification Required",
   and "Private Use" are as defined in [RFC 2434].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  DNS Query/Response Headers</h2></a>

   The header for DNS queries and responses contains field/bits in the
   following diagram taken from [RFC 2136, 2535]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                           1  1  1  1  1  1

            |                    ARCOUNT                    |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The ID field identifies the query and is echoed in the response so
   they can be matched.
   The QR bit indicates whether the header is for a query or a response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, and CD bits are each theoretically meaningful
   only in queries or only in responses, depending on the bit.  However,
   many DNS implementations copy the query header as the initial value
   of the response header without clearing bits.  Thus any attempt to
   use a "query" bit with a different meaning in a response or to define
   a query meaning for a "response" bit is dangerous given existing
   implementation.  Such meanings may only be assigned by an IETF
   Standards Action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The unsigned fields query count (QDCOUNT), answer count (ANCOUNT),
   authority count (NSCOUNT), and additional information count (ARCOUNT)
   express the number of records in each section for all opcodes except
   Update.  These fields have the same structure and data type for
   Update but are instead the counts for the zone (ZOCOUNT),
   prerequisite (PRCOUNT), update (UPCOUNT), and additional information
   (ARCOUNT) sections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1  One Spare Bit?</h3></a>

   There have been ancient DNS implementations for which the Z bit being
   on in a query meant that only a response from the primary server for
   a zone is acceptable.  It is believed that current DNS
   implementations ignore this bit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Assigning a meaning to the Z bit requires an IETF Standards Action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2  Opcode Assignment</h3></a>

   New OpCode assignments require an IETF Standards Action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Currently DNS OpCodes are assigned as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       OpCode Name                      Reference

        0     Query                     [RFC 1035]

       6-15   available for assignment
	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3  RCODE Assignment</h3></a>

   It would appear from the DNS header above that only four bits of
   RCODE, or response/error code are available.  However, RCODEs can
   appear not only at the top level of a DNS response but also inside
   OPT RRs [RFC 2671], TSIG RRs [RFC 2845], and TKEY RRs [RFC 2930].
   The OPT RR provides an eight bit extension resulting in a 12 bit
   RCODE field and the TSIG and TKEY RRs have a 16 bit RCODE field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Error codes appearing in the DNS header and in these three RR types
   all refer to the same error code space with the single exception of
   error code 16 which has a different meaning in the OPT RR from its
   meaning in other contexts.  See table below.

   NAME is an owner name, i.e., the name of the node to which this
   resource record pertains.  NAMEs are specific to a CLASS as described
   in section 3.2.  NAMEs consist of an ordered sequence of one or more
   labels each of which has a label type [RFC 1035, 2671].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TYPE is a two octet unsigned integer containing one of the RR TYPE
   codes.  See section 3.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CLASS is a two octet unsigned integer containing one of the RR CLASS
   codes.  See section 3.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TTL is a four octet (32 bit) bit unsigned integer that specifies the
   number of seconds that the resource record may be cached before the
   source of the information should again be consulted.  Zero is
   interpreted to mean that the RR can only be used for the transaction
   in progress.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RDLENGTH is an unsigned 16 bit integer that specifies the length in
   octets of the RDATA field.
   RDATA is a variable length string of octets that constitutes the
   resource.  The format of this information varies according to the
   TYPE and in some cases the CLASS of the resource record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  RR TYPE IANA Considerations</h3></a>

   There are three subcategories of RR TYPE numbers: data TYPEs, QTYPEs,
   and MetaTYPEs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Data TYPEs are the primary means of storing data.  QTYPES can only be
   used in queries.  Meta-TYPEs designate transient data associated with
   an particular DNS message and in some cases can also be used in
   queries.  Thus far, data TYPEs have been assigned from 1 upwards plus
   the block from 100 through 103 while Q and Meta Types have been
   assigned from 255 downwards (except for the OPT Meta-RR which is
   assigned TYPE 41).  There have been DNS implementations which made
   caching decisions based on the top bit of the bottom byte of the RR
   TYPE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are currently three Meta-TYPEs assigned: OPT [RFC 2671], TSIG
   [RFC 2845], and TKEY [RFC 2930].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are currently five QTYPEs assigned: * (all), MAILA, MAILB,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.1"><h4>3.1.1  Special Note on the OPT RR</h4></a>

   The OPT (OPTion) RR, number 41, is specified in [RFC 2671].  Its
   primary purpose is to extend the effective field size of various DNS
   fields including RCODE, label type, flag bits, and RDATA size.  In
   particular, for resolvers and servers that recognize it, it extends
   the RCODE field from 4 to 12 bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  RR CLASS IANA Considerations</h3></a>

   DNS CLASSes have been little used but constitute another dimension of
   the DNS distributed database.  In particular, there is no necessary
   relationship between the name space or root servers for one CLASS and
   those for another CLASS.  The same name can have completely different
   meanings in different CLASSes although the label types are the same
   and the null label is usable only as root in every CLASS.  However,
   as global networking and DNS have evolved, the IN, or Internet, CLASS
   has dominated DNS use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two subcategories of DNS CLASSes: normal data containing
   classes and QCLASSes that are only meaningful in queries or updates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3  RR NAME Considerations</h3></a>

   DNS NAMEs are sequences of labels [RFC 1035].  The last label in each
   NAME is "ROOT" which is the zero length label.  By definition, the
   null or ROOT label can not be used for any other NAME purpose.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At the present time, there are two categories of label types, data
   labels and compression labels.  Compression labels are pointers to
   data labels elsewhere within an RR or DNS message and are intended to
   shorten the wire encoding of NAMEs.  The two existing data label
   types are sometimes referred to as Text and Binary.  Text labels can,
   in fact, include any octet value including zero octets but most
   current uses involve only [US-ASCII].  For retrieval, Text labels are
   defined to treat ASCII upper and lower case letter codes as matching.
   Binary labels are bit sequences [RFC 2673].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IANA considerations for label types are given in [RFC 2671].
   NAMEs are local to a CLASS.  The Hesiod [Dyer 1987] and Chaos [Moon
   1981] CLASSes are essentially for local use.  The IN or Internet
   CLASS is thus the only DNS CLASS in global use on the Internet at
   this time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A somewhat dated description of name allocation in the IN Class is
   given in [RFC 1591].  Some information on reserved top level domain
   names is in Best Current Practice 32 [RFC 2606].
