This document is a snapshot of the work of the Router Requirements
working group as of November 1991.  At that time, the working group had
essentially finished its task.  There were some final technical matters
to be nailed down, and a great deal of editing needed to be done in
order to get the document ready for publication.  Unfortunately, these
tasks were never completed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">At the request of the Internet Area Director, the current editor took
the last draft of the document and, after consulting the mailing list
archives, meeting minutes, notes, and other members of the working
group, edited the document to its current form.  This effort included
the following tasks: 1) Deleting all the parenthetical material (such as
editor's comments). Useful information was turned into DISCUSSION
sections, the rest was deleted.  2) Completing the tasks listed in the
last draft's To be Done sections. As a part of this task, a new "to be
done" list was developed and included as an appendix to the current
document.  3) Rolling Philip Almquist's "Ruminations on the Next Hop"
and "Ruminations on Route Leaking" into this document.  These represent
significant work and should be kept.  4) Fulfilling the last intents of
the working group as determined from the archival material.  The intent
of this effort was to get the document into a form suitable for
publication as an Historical RFC so that the significant work which went
into the creation of this document would be preserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The content and form of this document are due, in large part, to the
working group's chair, and document's original editor and author: Philip
Almquist.  Without his efforts, this document would not exist.
	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   INTRODUCTION</h2></a>

The goal of this work is to replace RFC-1009, Requirements for Internet
Gateways ([INTRO:1]) with a new document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This memo is an intermediate step toward that goal. It defines and
discusses requirements for devices which perform the network layer
forwarding function of the Internet protocol suite.  The Internet
community usually refers to such devices as IP routers or simply
routers; The OSI community refers to such devices as intermediate
systems.  Many older Internet documents refer to these devices as
gateways, a name which more recently has largely passed out of favor to
avoid confusion with application gateways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">An IP router can be distinguished from other sorts of packet switching
devices in that a router examines the IP protocol header as part of the
switching process.  It generally has to modify the IP header and to
strip off and replace the Link Layer framing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The authors of this memo recognize, as should its readers, that many
routers support multiple protocol suites, and that support for multiple
protocol suites will be required in increasingly large parts of the
Internet in the future.  This memo, however, does not attempt to specify
Internet requirements for protocol suites other than TCP/IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This document enumerates standard protocols that a router connected to
the Internet must use, and it incorporates by reference the RFCs and
other documents describing the current specifications for these
protocols.  It corrects errors in the referenced documents and adds
additional discussion and guidance for an implementor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">For each protocol, this final version of this memo also contains an
explicit set of requirements, recommendations, and options.  The reader
must understand that the list of requirements in this memo is incomplete
by itself; the complete set of requirements for an Internet protocol
router is primarily defined in the standard protocol specification
documents, with the corrections, amendments, and supplements contained
in this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This memo should be read in conjunction with the Requirements for
Internet Hosts RFCs ([INTRO:2] and [INTRO:3]).  Internet hosts and
routers must both be capable of originating IP datagrams and receiving
IP datagrams destined for them.  The major distinction between Internet
hosts and routers is that routers are required to implement forwarding
algorithms and Internet hosts do not require forwarding capabilities.
Any Internet host acting as a router must adhere to the requirements
contained in the final version of this memo.
The goal of open system interconnection dictates that routers must
function correctly as Internet hosts when necessary.  To achieve this,
this memo provides guidelines for such instances.  For simplification
and ease of document updates, this memo tries to avoid overlapping
discussions of host requirements with [INTRO:2] and [INTRO:3] and
incorporates the relevant requirements of those documents by reference.
In some cases the requirements stated in [INTRO:2] and [INTRO:3] are
superseded by the final version of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A good-faith implementation of the protocols produced after careful
reading of the RFCs, with some interaction with the Internet technical
community, and that follows good communications software engineering
practices, should differ from the requirements of this memo in only
minor ways.  Thus, in many cases, the requirements in this document are
already stated or implied in the standard protocol documents, so that
their inclusion here is, in a sense, redundant.  However, they were
included because some past implementation has made the wrong choice,
causing problems of interoperability, performance, and/or robustness.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This memo includes discussion and explanation of many of the
requirements and recommendations.  A simple list of requirements would
be dangerous, because:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">o  Some required features are more important than others, and some
   features are optional.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">o  Some features are critical in some applications of routers but
   irrelevant in others.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">o  There may be valid reasons why particular vendor products that are
   designed for restricted contexts might choose to use different
   specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">However, the specifications of this memo must be followed to meet the
general goal of arbitrary router interoperation across the diversity and
complexity of the Internet.  Although most current implementations fail
to meet these requirements in various ways, some minor and some major,
this specification is the ideal towards which we need to move.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">These requirements are based on the current level of Internet
architecture.  This memo will be updated as required to provide
additional clarifications or to include additional information in those
areas in which specifications are still evolving.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Reading this Document</h3></a>


	<a name="section-1.1.1"><h4>1.1.1   Organization</h4></a>

      This memo emulates the layered organization used by [INTRO:2] and
      [INTRO:3].  Thus, Chapter 2 describes the layers found in the
      Internet architecture.  Chapter 3 covers the Link Layer.  Chapters
      4 and 5 are concerned with the Internet Layer protocols and
      forwarding algorithms.  Chapter 6 covers the Transport Layer.
      Upper layer protocols are divided between Chapter 7, which
      discusses the protocols which routers use to exchange routing
      information with each other, Chapter 8, which discusses network
      management, and Chapter 9, which discusses other upper layer
      protocols.  The final chapter covers operations and maintenance
      features.  This organization was chosen for simplicity, clarity,
      and consistency with the Host Requirements RFCs.  Appendices to
      this memo include a bibliography, a glossary, and some conjectures
      about future directions of router standards.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In describing the requirements, we assume that an implementation
      strictly mirrors the layering of the protocols.  However, strict
      layering is an imperfect model, both for the protocol suite and
      for recommended implementation approaches.  Protocols in different
      layers interact in complex and sometimes subtle ways, and
      particular functions often involve multiple layers.  There are
      many design choices in an implementation, many of which involve
      creative breaking of strict layering.  Every implementor is urged
      to read [INTRO:4] and [INTRO:5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In general, each major section of this memo is organized into the
      following subsections:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  Introduction<br>

      (2)  Protocol Walk-Through - considers the protocol specification<br>
           documents section-by-section, correcting errors, stating
           requirements that may be ambiguous or ill-defined, and
           providing further clarification or explanation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (3)  Specific Issues - discusses protocol design and<br>
           implementation issues that were not included in the walk-
           through.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Under many of the individual topics in this memo, there is
      parenthetical material labeled DISCUSSION or IMPLEMENTATION. This
      material is intended to give a justification, clarification or
      explanation to the preceding requirements text.  The
      implementation material contains suggested approaches that an
      implementor may want to consider.  The DISCUSSION and
      IMPLEMENTATION sections are not part of the standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1.2"><h4>1.1.2   Requirements</h4></a>

      In this memo, the words that are used to define the significance
      of each particular requirement are capitalized.  These words are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  MUST
         This word means that the item is an absolute requirement of the
         specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  MUST IMPLEMENT
         This phrase means that this specification requires that the
         item be implemented, but does not require that it be enabled by
         default.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  MUST NOT
         This phrase means that the item is an absolute prohibition of
         the specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  SHOULD
         This word means that there may exist valid reasons in
         particular circumstances to ignore this item, but the full
         implications should be understood and the case carefully
         weighed before choosing a different course.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  SHOULD IMPLEMENT
         This phrase is similar in meaning to SHOULD, but is used when
         we recommend that a particular feature be provided but does not
         necessarily recommend that it be enabled by default.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  SHOULD NOT
         This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in
         particular circumstances when the described behavior is
         acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be
         understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing
         any behavior described with this label.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  MAY
         This word means that this item is truly optional.  One vendor
         may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace
         requires it or because it enhances the product, for example;
         another vendor may omit the same item.
	<a name="section-1.1.3"><h4>1.1.3   Compliance</h4></a>

      Some requirements are applicable to all routers.  Other
      requirements are applicable only to those which implement
      particular features or protocols.  In the following paragraphs,
      Relevant refers to the union of the requirements applicable to all
      routers and the set of requirements applicable to a particular
      router because of the set of features and protocols it has
      implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that not all Relevant requirements are stated directly in
      this memo.  Various parts of this memo incorporate by reference
      sections of the Host Requirements specification, [INTRO:2] and
      [INTRO:3].  For purposes of determining compliance with this memo,
      it does not matter whether a Relevant requirement is stated
      directly in this memo or merely incorporated by reference from one
      of those documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An implementation is said to be conditionally compliant if it
      satisfies all of the Relevant MUST, MUST IMPLEMENT, and MUST NOT
      requirements.  An implementation is said to be unconditionally
      compliant if it is conditionally compliant and also satisfies all
      of the Relevant SHOULD, SHOULD IMPLEMENT, and SHOULD NOT
      requirements.  An implementation is not compliant if it is not
      conditionally compliant (i.e., it fails to satisfy one or more of
      the Relevant MUST, MUST IMPLEMENT, or MUST NOT requirements).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For any of the SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements, a router may
      provide a configuration option that will cause the router to act
      other than as specified by the requirement.  Having such a
      configuration option does not void a router's claim to
      unconditional compliance as long as the option has a default
      setting, and that leaving the option at its default setting causes
      the router to operate in a manner which conforms to the
      requirement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Likewise, routers may provide, except where explicitly prohibited
      by this memo, options which cause them to violate MUST or MUST NOT
      requirements.  A router which provides such options is compliant
      (either fully or conditionally) if and only if each such option
      has a default setting which causes the router to conform to the
      requirements of this memo.  Please note that the authors of this
      memo, although aware of market realities, strongly recommend
      against provision of such options.  Requirements are labeled MUST
      or MUST NOT because experts in the field have judged them to be
      particularly important to interoperability or proper functioning
      in the Internet.  Vendors should weigh carefully the customer
      support costs of providing options which violate those rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Of course, this memo is not a complete specification of an IP
      router, but rather is closer to what in the OSI world is called a
      profile.  For example, this memo requires that a number of
      protocols be implemented.  Although most of the contents of their
      protocol specifications are not repeated in this memo,
      implementors are nonetheless required to implement the protocols
      according to those specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Relationships to Other Standards</h3></a>

   current status of protocol specifications and standardization:

	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   General Considerations</h3></a>

   There are several important lessons that vendors of Internet software
   have learned and which a new vendor should consider seriously.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3.1"><h4>1.3.1   Continuing Internet Evolution</h4></a>

      The enormous growth of the Internet has revealed problems of
      management and scaling in a large datagram-based packet
      communication system.  These problems are being addressed, and as
      a result there will be continuing evolution of the specifications
      described in this memo.  New routing protocols, algorithms, and
      architectures are constantly being developed.  New and additional
      internet-layer protocols are also constantly being devised.
      Because routers play such a crucial role in the Internet, and
      because the number of routers deployed in the Internet is much
      smaller than the number of hosts, vendors should expect that
      router standards will continue to evolve much more quickly than
      host standards.  These changes will be carefully planned and
      controlled since there is extensive participation in this planning
      by the vendors and by the organizations responsible for operation
      of the networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Development, evolution, and revision are characteristic of
      computer network protocols today, and this situation will persist
      for some years.  A vendor who develops computer communications
      software for the Internet protocol suite (or any other protocol
      suite!) and then fails to maintain and update that software for
      changing specifications is going to leave a trail of unhappy
      customers.  The Internet is a large communication network, and the
      users are in constant contact through it.  Experience has shown
      that knowledge of deficiencies in vendor software propagates
      quickly through the Internet technical community.
	<a name="section-1.3.2"><h4>1.3.2   Robustness Principle</h4></a>

      At every layer of the protocols, there is a general rule (from
      [TRANS:2] by Jon Postel) whose application can lead to enormous
      benefits in robustness and interoperability:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                       Be conservative in what you do,
                  be liberal in what you accept from others.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Software should be written to deal with every conceivable error,
      no matter how unlikely; sooner or later a packet will come in with
      that particular combination of errors and attributes, and unless
      the software is prepared, chaos can ensue.  In general, it is best
      to assume that the network is filled with malevolent entities that
      will send packets designed to have the worst possible effect.
      This assumption will lead to suitably protective design.  The most
      serious problems in the Internet have been caused by unforeseen
      mechanisms triggered by low probability events; mere human malice
      would never have taken so devious a course!

      Adaptability to change must be designed into all levels of router
      software.  As a simple example, consider a protocol specification
      that contains an enumeration of values for a particular header
      field - e.g., a type field, a port number, or an error code; this
      enumeration must be assumed to be incomplete.  If the protocol
      specification defines four possible error codes, the software must
      not break when a fifth code shows up.  An undefined code might be
      logged, but it must not cause a failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The second part of the principle is almost as important: software
      on hosts or other routers may contain deficiencies that make it
      unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features.  It is
      unwise to stray far from the obvious and simple, lest untoward
      effects result elsewhere.  A corollary of this is watch out for
      misbehaving hosts; router software should be prepared to survive
      in the presence of misbehaving hosts.  An important function of
      routers in the Internet is to limit the amount of disruption such
      hosts can inflict on the shared communication facility.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3.3"><h4>1.3.3   Error Logging</h4></a>

      The Internet includes a great variety of systems, each
      implementing many protocols and protocol layers, and some of these
      contain bugs and misfeatures in their Internet protocol software.
      As a result of complexity, diversity, and distribution of
      function, the diagnosis of problems is often very difficult.
      Problem diagnosis will be aided if routers include a carefully
      designed facility for logging erroneous or strange events.  It is
      important to include as much diagnostic information as possible
      when an error is logged.  In particular, it is often useful to
      record the header(s) of a packet that caused an error.  However,
      care must be taken to ensure that error logging does not consume
      prohibitive amounts of resources or otherwise interfere with the
      operation of the router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There is a tendency for abnormal but harmless protocol events to
      overflow error logging files; this can be avoided by using a
      circular log, or by enabling logging only while diagnosing a known
      failure.  It may be useful to filter and count duplicate
      successive messages.  One strategy that seems to work well is to
      both:
      o  Always count abnormalities and make such counts accessible
         through the management protocol (see Chapter 8); and
      o  Allow the logging of a great variety of events to be
         selectively enabled.  For example, it might useful to be able
         to log everything or to log everything for host X.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This topic is further discussed in [MGT:5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3.4"><h4>1.3.4   Configuration</h4></a>

      In an ideal world, routers would be easy to configure, and perhaps
      even entirely self-configuring.  However, practical experience in
      the real world suggests that this is an impossible goal, and that
      in fact many attempts by vendors to make configuration easy
      actually cause customers more grief than they prevent.  As an
      extreme example, a router designed to come up and start routing
      packets without requiring any configuration information at all
      would almost certainly choose some incorrect parameter, possibly
      causing serious problems on any networks unfortunate enough to be
      connected to it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Often this memo requires that a parameter be a configurable
      option.  There are several reasons for this.  In a few cases there
      currently is some uncertainty or disagreement about the best value
      and it may be necessary to update the recommended value in the
      future.  In other cases, the value really depends on external
      factors - e.g., the distribution of its communication load, or the
      speeds and topology of nearby networks - and self-tuning
      algorithms are unavailable and may be insufficient.  In some
      cases, configurability is needed because of administrative
      requirements.
      Finally, some configuration options are required to communicate
      with obsolete or incorrect implementations of the protocols,
      distributed without sources, that persist in many parts of the
      Internet.  To make correct systems coexist with these faulty
      systems, administrators must occasionally misconfigure the correct
      systems.  This problem will correct itself gradually as the faulty
      systems are retired, but cannot be ignored by vendors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When we say that a parameter must be configurable, we do not
      intend to require that its value be explicitly read from a
      configuration file at every boot time.  For many parameters, there
      is one value that is appropriate for all but the most unusual
      situations.  In such cases, it is quite reasonable that the
      parameter default to that value if not explicitly set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This memo requires a particular value for such defaults in some
      cases.  The choice of default is a sensitive issue when the
      configuration item controls accommodation of existing, faulty,
      systems.  If the Internet is to converge successfully to complete
      interoperability, the default values built into implementations
      must implement the official protocol, not misconfigurations to
      accommodate faulty implementations.  Although marketing
      considerations have led some vendors to choose misconfiguration
      defaults, we urge vendors to choose defaults that will conform to
      the standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Finally, we note that a vendor needs to provide adequate
      documentation on all configuration parameters, their limits and
      effects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4"><h3>1.4   Algorithms</h3></a>

   In several places in this memo, specific algorithms that a router
   ought to follow are specified.  These algorithms are not, per se,
   required of the router.  A router need not implement each algorithm
   as it is written in this document.  Rather, an implementation must
   present a behavior to the external world that is the same as a
   strict, literal, implementation of the specified algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Algorithms are described in a manner that differs from the way a good
   implementor would implement them.  For expository purposes, a style
   that emphasizes conciseness, clarity, and independence from
   implementation details has been chosen.  A good implementor will
   choose algorithms and implementation methods which produce the same
   results as these algorithms, but may be more efficient or less
   general.
   We note that the art of efficient router implementation is outside of
   the scope of this memo.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   INTERNET ARCHITECTURE</h2></a>

This chapter does not contain any requirements.  However, it does
contain useful background information on the general architecture of the
Internet and of routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">General background and discussion on the Internet architecture and
supporting protocol suite can be found in the DDN Protocol Handbook
[ARCH:1]; for background see for example [ARCH:2], [ARCH:3], and
[ARCH:4].  The Internet architecture and protocols are also covered in
an ever-growing number of textbooks, such as [ARCH:5] and [ARCH:6].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Introduction</h3></a>

   The Internet system consists of a number of interconnected packet
   networks supporting communication among host computers using the
   Internet protocols.  These protocols include the Internet Protocol
   (IP), the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Internet
   Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and a variety transport and
   application protocols that depend upon them.  As was described in
   Section [1.2], the Internet Engineering Steering Group periodically
   releases an Official Protocols memo listing all of the Internet
   protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All Internet protocols use IP as the basic data transport mechanism.
   IP is a datagram, or connectionless, internetwork service and
   includes provision for addressing, type-of-service specification,
   fragmentation and reassembly, and security.  ICMP and IGMP are
   considered integral parts of IP, although they are architecturally
   layered upon IP.  ICMP provides error reporting, flow control,
   first-hop router redirection, and other maintenance and control
   functions.  IGMP provides the mechanisms by which hosts and routers
   can join and leave IP multicast groups.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reliable data delivery is provided in the Internet protocol suite by
   Transport Layer protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP), which provides end-end retransmission, resequencing and
   connection control.  Transport Layer connectionless service is
   provided by the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Elements of the Architecture</h3></a>


	<a name="section-2.2.1"><h4>2.2.1   Protocol Layering</h4></a>

      To communicate using the Internet system, a host must implement
      the layered set of protocols comprising the Internet protocol
      suite.  A host typically must implement at least one protocol from
      each layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The protocol layers used in the Internet architecture are as
      follows [ARCH:7]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Application Layer
         The Application Layer is the top layer of the Internet protocol
         suite.  The Internet suite does not further subdivide the
         Application Layer, although some application layer protocols do
         contain some internal sub-layering.  The application layer of
         the Internet suite essentially combines the functions of the
         top two layers - Presentation and Application - of the OSI
         Reference Model [ARCH:8].  The Application Layer in the
         Internet protocol suite also includes some of the function
         relegated to the Session Layer in the OSI Reference Model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         We distinguish two categories of application layer protocols:
         user protocols that provide service directly to users, and
         support protocols that provide common system functions.  The
         most common Internet user protocols are:
         - Telnet (remote login)
         - FTP (file transfer)
         - SMTP (electronic mail delivery)

         There are a number of other standardized user protocols and
         many private user protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Support protocols, used for host name mapping, booting, and
         management, include SNMP, BOOTP, TFTP, the Domain Name System
         (DNS) protocol, and a variety of routing protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Application Layer protocols relevant to routers are discussed
         in chapters 7, 8, and 9 of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Transport Layer
         The Transport Layer provides end-to-end communication services.
         This layer is roughly equivalent to the Transport Layer in the
         OSI Reference Model, except that it also incorporates some of
         OSI's Session Layer establishment and destruction functions.
         There are two primary Transport Layer protocols at present:
         - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
         - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

         TCP is a reliable connection-oriented transport service that
         provides end-to-end reliability, resequencing, and flow
         control.  UDP is a connectionless (datagram) transport service.
         Other transport protocols have been developed by the research
         community, and the set of official Internet transport protocols
         may be expanded in the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Transport Layer protocols relevant to routers are discussed in

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Internet Layer
         All Internet transport protocols use the Internet Protocol (IP)
         to carry data from source host to destination host.  IP is a
         connectionless or datagram internetwork service, providing no
         end-to-end delivery guarantees. IP datagrams may arrive at the
         destination host damaged, duplicated, out of order, or not at
         all.  The layers above IP are responsible for reliable delivery
         service when it is required.  The IP protocol includes
         provision for addressing, type-of-service specification,
         fragmentation and reassembly, and security.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The datagram or connectionless nature of IP is a fundamental

         protocol that is considered to be an integral part of IP,
         although it is architecturally layered upon IP, i.e., it uses
         IP to carry its data end-to-end.  ICMP provides error
         reporting, congestion reporting, and first-hop router
         redirection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is an Internet

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Link Layer
         To communicate on its directly-connected network, a host must
         implement the communication protocol used to interface to that
         network.  We call this a Link Layer layer protocol.
         Some older Internet documents refer to this layer as the
         Network Layer, but it is not the same as the Network Layer in
         the OSI Reference Model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Protocols in this Layer are generally outside the scope of

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.2"><h4>2.2.2   Networks</h4></a>

      The constituent networks of the Internet system are required to
      provide only packet (connectionless) transport.  According to the
      IP service specification, datagrams can be delivered out of order,
      be lost or duplicated, and/or contain errors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For reasonable performance of the protocols that use IP (e.g.,

      networks providing connection-oriented service, the extra
      reliability provided by virtual circuits enhances the end-end
      robustness of the system, but is not necessary for Internet
      operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Constituent networks may generally be divided into two classes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        o  Local-Area Networks (LANs)
           LANs may have a variety of designs.  In general, a LAN will
           cover a small geographical area (e.g., a single building or
           plant site) and provide high bandwidth with low delays.  LANs
           may be passive (similar to Ethernet) or they may be active
           (such as ATM).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        o  Wide-Area Networks (WANs)
           Geographically-dispersed hosts and LANs are interconnected by
           wide-area networks, also called long-haul networks.  These
           networks may have a complex internal structure of lines and
           packet-switches, or they may be as simple as point-to-point
           lines.
	<a name="section-2.2.3"><h4>2.2.3   Routers</h4></a>

      In the Internet model, constituent networks are connected together
      by IP datagram forwarders which are called routers or IP routers.
      In this document, every use of the term router is equivalent to IP
      router.  Many older Internet documents refer to routers as
      gateways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Historically, routers have been realized with packet-switching
      software executing on a general-purpose CPU.  However, as custom
      hardware development becomes cheaper and as higher throughput is
      required, but special-purpose hardware is becoming increasingly
      common.  This specification applies to routers regardless of how
      they are implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A router is connected to two or more networks, appearing to each
      of these networks as a connected host.  Thus, it has (at least)
      one physical interface and (at least) one IP address on each of
      the connected networks (this ignores the concept of un-numbered
      links, which is discussed in section [2.2.7]).  Forwarding an IP
      datagram generally requires the router to choose the address of
      the next-hop router or (for the final hop) the destination host.
      This choice, called routing, depends upon a routing database
      within the router.  The routing database is also sometimes known
      as a routing table or forwarding table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The routing database should be maintained dynamically to reflect
      the current topology of the Internet system.  A router normally
      accomplishes this by participating in distributed routing and
      reachability algorithms with other routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Routers provide datagram transport only, and they seek to minimize
      the state information necessary to sustain this service in the
      interest of routing flexibility and robustness.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Packet switching devices may also operate at the Link Layer; such
      devices are usually called bridges. Network segments which are
      connected by bridges share the same IP network number, i.e., they
      logically form a single IP network.  These other devices are
      outside of the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Another variation on the simple model of networks connected with
      routers sometimes occurs: a set of routers may be interconnected
      with only serial lines, to form a network in which the packet
      switching is performed at the Internetwork (IP) Layer rather than
      the Link Layer.
	<a name="section-2.2.4"><h4>2.2.4   Autonomous Systems</h4></a>

      For technical, managerial, and sometimes political reasons, the
      routers of the Internet system are grouped into collections called
      autonomous systems.  The routers included in a single autonomous
      system (AS) are expected to:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Be under the control of a single operations and maintenance
         (O&M) organization;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Employ common routing protocols among themselves, to
         dynamically maintain their routing databases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A number of different dynamic routing protocols have been
      developed (see Section [7.2]); the routing protocol within a
      single AS is generically called an interior gateway protocol or
      IGP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An IP datagram may have to traverse the routers of two or more ASs
      to reach its destination, and the ASs must provide each other with
      topology information to allow such forwarding.  An exterior
      gateway protocol (generally BGP or EGP) is used for this purpose.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.5"><h4>2.2.5   Addresses and Subnets</h4></a>

      An IP datagram carries 32-bit source and destination addresses,
      each of which is partitioned into two parts - a constituent
      network number and a host number on that network.  Symbolically:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         IP-address  ::=  { <Network-number>, <Host-number> }

      To finally deliver the datagram, the last router in its path must
      map the Host-number (or rest) part of an IP address into the
      physical address of a host connection to the constituent network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This simple notion has been extended by the concept of subnets,
      which were introduced in order to allow arbitrary complexity of
      interconnected LAN structures within an organization, while
      insulating the Internet system against explosive growth in network
      numbers and routing complexity.  Subnets essentially provide a
      multi-level hierarchical routing structure for the Internet
      system.  The subnet extension, described in [INTERNET:2], is now a
      required part of the Internet architecture.  The basic idea is to
      partition the <Host-number> field into two parts: a subnet number,
      and a true host number on that subnet:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         IP-address  ::=
           { <Network-number>, <Subnet-number>, <Host-number> }

      The interconnected physical networks within an organization will
      be given the same network number but different subnet numbers.
      The distinction between the subnets of such a subnetted network is
      normally not visible outside of that network.  Thus, routing in
      the rest of the Internet will be based only upon the <Network-
      number> part of the IP destination address; routers outside the
      network will combine <Subnet-number> and <Host-number> together to
      form an uninterpreted rest part of the 32-bit IP address.  Within
      the subnetted network, the routers must route on the basis of an
      extended network number:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         { <Network-number>, <Subnet-number> }

      Under certain circumstances, it may be desirable to support
      subnets of a particular network being interconnected only via a
      path which is not part of the subnetted network.  Even though many
      IGP's and no EGP's currently support this configuration
      effectively, routers need to be able to support this configuration
      of subnetting (see Section [4.2.3.4]).  In general, routers should
      not make assumptions about what are subnets and what are not, but
      simply ignore the concept of Class in networks, and treat each
      route as a { network, mask }-tuple.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         It is becoming clear that as the Internet grows larger and
         larger, the traditional uses of Class A, B, and C networks will
         be modified in order to achieve better use of IP's 32-bit
         address space.  Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)
         [INTERNET:15] is a method currently being deployed in the
         Internet backbones to achieve this added efficiency.  CIDR
         depends on the ability of assigning and routing to networks
         that are not based on Class A, B, or C networks.  Thus, routers
         should always treat a route as a network with a mask.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Furthermore, for similar reasons, a subnetted network need not
      have a consistent subnet mask through all parts of the network.
      For example, one subnet may use an 8 bit subnet mask, another 10
      bit, and another 6 bit.  Routers need to be able to support this
      type of configuration (see Section [4.2.3.4]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The bit positions containing this extended network number are
      indicated by a 32-bit mask called the subnet mask; it is
      recommended but not required that the <Subnet-number> bits be
      contiguous and fall between the <Network-number> and the <Host-
      number> fields.  No subnet should be assigned the value zero or -1
      (all one bits).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Although the inventors of the subnet mechanism probably expected
      that each piece of an organization's network would have only a
      single subnet number, in practice it has often proven necessary or
      useful to have several subnets share a single physical cable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There are special considerations for the router when a connected
      network provides a broadcast or multicast capability; these will
      be discussed later.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.6"><h4>2.2.6   IP Multicasting</h4></a>

      IP multicasting is an extension of Link Layer multicast to IP
      internets.  Using IP multicasts, a single datagram can be
      addressed to multiple hosts. This collection of hosts is called a
      multicast group.  Each multicast group is represented as a Class D
      IP address.  An IP datagram sent to the group is to be delivered
      to each group member with the same best-effort delivery as that
      provided for unicast IP traffic.  The sender of the datagram does
      not itself need to be a member of the destination group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The semantics of IP multicast group membership are defined in
      [INTERNET:4].  That document describes how hosts and routers join
      and leave multicast groups.  It also defines a protocol, the
      Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), that monitors IP
      multicast group membership.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Forwarding of IP multicast datagrams is accomplished either
      through static routing information or via a multicast routing
      protocol.  Devices that forward IP multicast datagrams are called
      multicast routers. They may or may not also forward IP unicasts.
      In general, multicast datagrams are forwarded on the basis of both
      their source and destination addresses.  Forwarding of IP
      multicast packets is described in more detail in Section [5.2.1].
      Appendix D discusses multicast routing protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.7"><h4>2.2.7   Unnumbered Lines and Networks and Subnets</h4></a>

      Traditionally, each network interface on an IP host or router has
      its own IP address.  Over the years, people have observed that
      this can cause inefficient use of the scarce IP address space,
      since it forces allocation of an IP network number, or at least a
      subnet number, to every point-to-point link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To solve this problem, a number of people have proposed and
      implemented the concept of unnumbered serial lines.  An unnumbered
      serial line does not have any IP network or subnet number
      associated with it.  As a consequence, the network interfaces
      connected to an unnumbered serial line do not have IP addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Because the IP architecture has traditionally assumed that all
      interfaces had IP addresses, these unnumbered interfaces cause
      some interesting dilemmas.  For example, some IP options (e.g.
      Record Route) specify that a router must insert the interface
      address into the option, but an unnumbered interface has no IP
      address.  Even more fundamental (as we shall see in chapter 5) is
      that routes contain the IP address of the next hop router.  A
      router expects that that IP address will be on an IP (sub)net that
      the router is connected to.  That assumption is of course violated
      if the only connection is an unnumbered serial line.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To get around these difficulties, two schemes have been invented.
      The first scheme says that two routers connected by an unnumbered
      serial line aren't really two routers at all, but rather two
      half-routers which together make up a single (virtual) router.
      The unnumbered serial line is essentially considered to be an
      internal bus in the virtual router.  The two halves of the virtual
      router must coordinate their activities in such a way that they
      act exactly like a single router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This scheme fits in well with the IP architecture, but suffers
      from two important drawbacks.  The first is that, although it
      handles the common case of a single unnumbered serial line, it is
      not readily extensible to handle the case of a mesh of routers and
      unnumbered serial lines.  The second drawback is that the
      interactions between the half routers are necessarily complex and
      are not standardized, effectively precluding the connection of
      equipment from different vendors using unnumbered serial lines.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Because of these drawbacks, this memo has adopted an alternative
      scheme, which has been invented multiple times but which is
      probably originally attributable to Phil Karn.  In this scheme, a
      router which has unnumbered serial lines also has a special IP
      address, called a router-id in this memo.  The router-id is one of
      the router's IP addresses (a router is required to have at least
      one IP address).  This router-id is used as if it is the IP
      address of all unnumbered interfaces.

         A router may be a stand-alone computer system, dedicated to its
         IP router functions.  Alternatively, it is possible to embed
         router functions within a host operating system which supports
         connections to two or more networks.  The best-known example of
         an operating system with embedded router code is the Berkeley
         BSD system.  The embedded router feature seems to make
         internetting easy, but it has a number of hidden pitfalls:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (1)  If a host has only a single constituent-network interface,<br>
              it should not act as a router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              For example, hosts with embedded router code that
              gratuitously forward broadcast packets or datagrams on the
              same net often cause packet avalanches.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (2)  If a (multihomed) host acts as a router, it must implement<br>
              ALL the relevant router requirements contained in this

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              For example, the routing protocol issues and the router
              control and monitoring problems are as hard and important
              for embedded routers as for stand-alone routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              Since Internet router requirements and specifications may
              change independently of operating system changes, an
              administration that operates an embedded router in the
              Internet is strongly advised to have the ability to
              maintain and update the router code (e.g., this might
              require router code source).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (3)  Once a host runs embedded router code, it becomes part of<br>

         There are two basic models for interconnecting local-area
         networks and wide-area (or long-haul) networks in the Internet.
         In the first, the local-area network is assigned a network
         number and all routers in the Internet must know how to route
         to that network.  In the second, the local-area network shares
         (a small part of) the address space of the wide-area network.
         Routers that support this second model are called address
         sharing routers or transparent routers.  The focus of this memo
         is on routers that support the first model, but this is not
         intended to exclude the use of transparent routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The basic idea of a transparent router is that the hosts on the
         local-area network behind such a router share the address space
         of the wide-area network in front of the router.  In certain
         situations this is a very useful approach and the limitations
         do not present significant drawbacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The words in front and behind indicate one of the limitations
         of this approach: this model of interconnection is suitable
         only for a geographically (and topologically) limited stub
         environment.  It requires that there be some form of logical
         addressing in the network level addressing of the wide-area
         network.  All of the IP addresses in the local environment map
         to a few (usually one) physical address in the wide-area
         network.  This mapping occurs in a way consistent with the { IP
         address <-> network address } mapping used throughout the
         wide-area network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Multihoming is possible on one wide-area network, but may
         present routing problems if the interfaces are geographically
         or topologically separated.  Multihoming on two (or more)
         wide-area networks is a problem due to the confusion of
         addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The behavior that hosts see from other hosts in what is
         apparently the same network may differ if the transparent
         router cannot fully emulate the normal wide-area network
         service.  For example, the ARPANET used a Link Layer protocol
         that provided a Destination Dead indication in response to an
         attempt to send to a host which was powered off.  However, if
         there were a transparent router between the ARPANET and an
         Ethernet, a host on the ARPANET would not receive a Destination
         Dead indication if it sent a datagram to a host that was
         powered off and was connected to the ARPANET via the
         transparent router instead of directly.

      these areas are expected, as the research community is actively
      working on these issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  High Availability

      These routers need to be highly reliable, providing 24 hours a
      day, 7 days a week service.  Equipment and software faults can
      have a wide-spread (sometimes global) effect.  In case of failure,
      they must recover quickly.  In any environment, a router must be
      highly robust and able to operate, possibly in a degraded state,
      under conditions of extreme congestion or failure of network
      resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Advanced O&M Features

      Internet routers normally operate in an unattended mode.  They

      and measuring traffic and other events and for diagnosing faults.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  High Performance

      Long-haul lines in the Internet today are most frequently 56 Kbps,
      DS1 (1.4Mbps), and DS3 (45Mbps) speeds.  LANs are typically
      Ethernet (10Mbps) and, to a lesser degree, FDDI (100Mbps).
      However, network media technology is constantly advancing and even
      higher speeds are likely in the future.  Full-duplex operation is
      provided at all of these speeds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The requirements for routers used in the LAN fringe (e.g., campus
   networks) depend greatly on the demands of the local networks.  These
   may be high or medium-performance devices, probably competitively
   procured from several different vendors and operated by an internal
   organization (e.g., a campus computing center).  The design of these
   routers should emphasize low average latency and good burst
   performance, together with delay and type-of-service sensitive
   resource management. In this environment there may be less formal O&M
   but it will not be less important.  The need for the routing
   mechanism to be highly dynamic will become more important as networks
   become more complex and interconnected.  Users will demand more out
   of their local connections because of the speed of the global
   interconnects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As networks have grown, and as more networks have become old enough

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Architectural Assumptions</h3></a>

   The current Internet architecture is based on a set of assumptions
   about the communication system.  The assumptions most relevant to
   routers are as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Internet is a network of networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Each host is directly connected to some particular network(s); its
      connection to the Internet is only conceptual.  Two hosts on the
      same network communicate with each other using the same set of
      protocols that they would use to communicate with hosts on distant
      networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Routers don't keep connection state information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To improve the robustness of the communication system, routers are
      designed to be stateless, forwarding each IP packet independently
      of other packets.  As a result, redundant paths can be exploited
      to provide robust service in spite of failures of intervening
      routers and networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      All state information required for end-to-end flow control and
      reliability is implemented in the hosts, in the transport layer or
      in application programs.  All connection control information is
      thus co-located with the end points of the communication, so it
      will be lost only if an end point fails.  Routers effect flow
      control only indirectly, by dropping packets or increasing network
      delay.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that future protocol developments may well end up putting
      some more state into routers.  This is especially likely for
      resource reservation and flows.
   o  Routing complexity should be in the routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Routing is a complex and difficult problem, and ought to be
      performed by the routers, not the hosts.  An important objective
      is to insulate host software from changes caused by the inevitable
      evolution of the Internet routing architecture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The system must tolerate wide network variation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A basic objective of the Internet design is to tolerate a wide
      range of network characteristics - e.g., bandwidth, delay, packet
      loss, packet reordering, and maximum packet size.  Another
      objective is robustness against failure of individual networks,
      routers, and hosts, using whatever bandwidth is still available.
      Finally, the goal is full open system interconnection: an Internet
      router must be able to interoperate robustly and effectively with
      any other router or Internet host, across diverse Internet paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Sometimes implementors have designed for less ambitious goals.
      For example, the LAN environment is typically much more benign
      than the Internet as a whole; LANs have low packet loss and delay
      and do not reorder packets.  Some vendors have fielded
      implementations that are adequate for a simple LAN environment,
      but work badly for general interoperation.  The vendor justifies
      such a product as being economical within the restricted LAN
      market.  However, isolated LANs seldom stay isolated for long;
      they are soon connected to each other, to organization-wide
      internets, and eventually to the global Internet system.  In the
      end, neither the customer nor the vendor is served by incomplete
      or substandard routers.

Although  [INTRO:1] covers Link Layer standards (IP over foo, ARP,

      originate trailer encapsulated packets.  A router MUST NOT
      originate trailer encapsulated packets without first verifying,
      using the mechanism described in section 2.3.1 of [INTRO:2], that
      the immediate destination of the packet is willing and able to

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.4"><h4>3.3.4   Maximum Transmission Unit - MTU</h4></a>

      The MTU of each logical interface MUST be configurable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Many Link Layer protocols define a maximum frame size that may be
      sent.  In such cases, a router MUST NOT allow an MTU to be set
      which would allow sending of frames larger than those allowed by
      the Link Layer protocol.  However, a router SHOULD be willing to
      receive a packet as large as the maximum frame size even if that
      is larger than the MTU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         Note that this is a stricter requirement than imposed on hosts
         by [INTRO:2], which requires that the MTU of each physical
         interface be configurable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         If a network is using an MTU smaller than the maximum frame
         size for the Link Layer, a router may receive packets larger

      Contrary to [INTRO:1], the Internet does have a standard serial

      [LINK:2], [LINK:3], [LINK:4], and [LINK:5].

         This section provides guidelines to router implementors so that
         they can ensure interoperability with other routers using PPP
         over either synchronous or asynchronous links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         It is critical that an implementor understand the semantics of
         the option negotiation mechanism.  Options are a means for a
         local device to indicate to a remote peer what the local device
         will *accept* from the remote peer, not what it wishes to send.
         It is up to the remote peer to decide what is most convenient
         to send within the confines of the set of options that the
         local device has stated that it can accept.  Therefore it is
         perfectly acceptable and normal for a remote peer to ACK all
         the options indicated in an LCP Configuration Request (CR) even
         if the remote peer does not support any of those options.
         Again, the options are simply a mechanism for either device to
         indicate to its peer what it will accept, not necessarily what
         it will send.
<a name="section-3.3.5.2"><h4>3.3.5.2   Link Control Protocol (LCP) Options</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1716.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

         The PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) offers a number of options
         that may be negotiated.  These options include (among others)
         address and control field compression, protocol field
         compression, asynchronous character map, Maximum Receive Unit
         (MRU), Link Quality Monitoring (LQM), magic number (for
         loopback detection), Password Authentication Protocol (PAP),
         Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), and the
         32-bit Frame Check Sequence (FCS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router MAY do address/control field compression on either
         synchronous or asynchronous links.  A router MAY do protocol
         field compression on either synchronous or asynchronous links.
         A router MAY indicate that it can accept these compressions,
         but MUST be able to accept uncompressed PPP header information
         even if it has indicated a willingness to receive compressed
         PPP headers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            These options control the appearance of the PPP header.
            Normally the PPP header consists of the address field (one
            byte containing the value 0xff), the control field (one byte
            containing the value 0x03), and the two-byte protocol field
            that identifies the contents of the data area of the frame.
            If a system negotiates address and control field compression
            it indicates to its peer that it will accept PPP frames that
            have or do not have these fields at the front of the header.
            It does not indicate that it will be sending frames with
            these fields removed.  The protocol field may also be
            compressed from two to one byte in most cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
         IMPLEMENTATION:
            Some hardware does not deal well with variable length header
            information.  In those cases it makes most sense for the
            remote peer to send the full PPP header.  Implementations
            may ensure this by not sending the address/control field and
            protocol field compression options to the remote peer.  Even
            if the remote peer has indicated an ability to receive
            compressed headers there is no requirement for the local
            router to send compressed headers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router MUST negotiate the Async Control Character Map (ACCM)
         for asynchronous PPP links, but SHOULD NOT negotiate the ACCM
         for synchronous links.  If a router receives an attempt to
         negotiate the ACCM over a synchronous link, it MUST ACKnowledge
         the option and then ignore it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            There are implementations that offer both sync and async
            modes of operation and may use the same code to implement
            the option negotiation.  In this situation it is possible
            that one end or the other may send the ACCM option on a
            synchronous link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router SHOULD properly negotiate the maximum receive unit
         (MRU).  Even if a system negotiates an MRU smaller than 1,500
         bytes, it MUST be able to receive a 1,500 byte frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router SHOULD negotiate and enable the link quality
         monitoring (LQM) option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            This memo does not specify a policy for deciding whether the
            link's quality is adequate.  However, it is important (see
            Section [3.3.6]) that a router disable failed links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router SHOULD implement and negotiate the magic number option
         for loopback detection.

         authentication protocol, and/or CHAP - challenge handshake
         authentication protocol).

         A router MAY offer to perform IP address negotiation.  A router
         MUST accept a refusal (REJect) to perform IP address
         negotiation from the peer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router SHOULD NOT perform Van Jacobson header compression of
         TCP/IP packets if the link speed is in excess of 64 Kbps.
         Below that speed the router MAY perform Van Jacobson (VJ)
         header compression.  At link speeds of 19,200 bps or less the
         router SHOULD perform VJ header compression.
	<a name="section-3.3.6"><h4>3.3.6   Interface Testing</h4></a>

      A router MUST have a mechanism to allow routing software to
      determine whether a physical interface is available to send
      packets or not.  A router SHOULD have a mechanism to allow routing
      software to judge the quality of a physical interface.  A router
      MUST have a mechanism for informing the routing software when a
      physical interface becomes available or unavailable to send
      packets because of administrative action.  A router MUST have a

      Link level interface has become available or unavailable, for any
      reason.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         It is crucial that routers have workable mechanisms for
         determining that their network connections are functioning

   This chapter and chapter 5 discuss the protocols used at the Internet
   Layer: IP, ICMP, and IGMP.  Since forwarding is obviously a crucial
   topic in a document discussing routers, chapter 5 limits itself to
   the aspects of the protocols which directly relate to forwarding.

      a result.  However, for diagnosis of problems a router SHOULD
      provide the capability of logging the error (see Section [1.3.3]),

         In datagrams received by the router itself, the IP layer MUST

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              DISCUSSION:
                 Note that the security options described in

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (b)  Stream Identifier Option

              This option is obsolete; routers SHOULD NOT place this

              option MUST be ignored in datagrams received by the
              router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (c)  Source Route Options

              A router MUST be able to act as the final destination of a
              source route.  If a router receives a packet containing a
              completed source route (i.e., the pointer points beyond
              the last field and the destination address in the IP
              header addresses the router), the packet has reached its
              final destination; the option as received (the recorded
              route) MUST be passed up to the transport layer (or to
              ICMP message processing).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              In order to respond correctly to source-routed datagrams
              it receives, a router MUST provide a means whereby
              transport protocols and applications can reverse the
              source route in a received datagram and insert the
              reversed source route into datagrams they originate (see
              Section 4 of [INTRO:2] for details).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              Some applications in the router MAY require that the user

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              A router MUST NOT originate a datagram containing multiple

              is described in Section [5.2.4.1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              When a source route option is created, it MUST be

              (see case (B) in the discussion below).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              DISCUSSION:
                 Suppose a source routed datagram is to be routed from
                 source S to destination D via routers G1, G2, ... Gn.
                 Source S constructs a datagram with G1's IP address as
                 its destination address, and a source route option to
                 get the datagram the rest of the way to its
                 destination.  However, there is an ambiguity in the
                 specification over whether the source route option in a
                 datagram sent out by S should be (A) or (B):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 (A):  {>>G2, G3, ... Gn, D}     <--- CORRECT

                 (B):  {S, >>G2, G3, ... Gn, D}  <---- WRONG
                 (where >> represents the pointer).  If (A) is sent, the
                 datagram received at D will contain the option: {G1,
                 G2, ... Gn >>}, with S and D as the IP source and
                 destination addresses.  If (B) were sent, the datagram
                 received at D would again contain S and D as the same
                 IP source and destination addresses, but the option
                 would be: {S, G1, ...Gn >>}; i.e., the originating host
                 would be the first hop in the route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (d)  Record Route Option

              Routers MAY support the Record Route option in datagrams
              originated by the router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (e)  Timestamp Option

              Routers MAY support the timestamp option in datagrams
              originated by the router.  The following rules apply:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  When originating a datagram containing a Timestamp

                 - Its Internet address fields are not pre-specified or
                 - Its first pre-specified address is the IP address of
                    the logical interface over which the datagram is
                    being sent (or the router's router-id if the
                    datagram is being sent over an unnumbered
                    interface).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  If the router itself receives a datagram containing a

                 in the option to do so) before passing the option to
                 the transport layer or to ICMP for processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  A timestamp value MUST follow the rules given in

                 To maximize the utility of the timestamps contained in
                 the timestamp option, it is suggested that the
                 timestamp inserted be, as nearly as practical, the time
                 at which the packet arrived at the router.  For
                 datagrams originated by the router, the timestamp
                 inserted should be, as nearly as practical, the time at
                 which the datagram was passed to the Link Layer for
                 transmission.

         When a router inserts its address into a Record Route, Strict
         Source and Record Route, Loose Source and Record Route, or
         Timestamp, it MUST use the IP address of the logical interface
         on which the packet is being sent.  Where this rule cannot be
         obeyed because the output interface has no IP address (i.e., is
         an unnumbered interface), the router MUST instead insert its
         router-id.  The router's router-id is one of the router's IP
         addresses.  Which of the router's addresses is used as the
         router-id MUST NOT change (even across reboots) unless changed
         by the network manager or unless the configuration of the
         router is changed such that the IP address used as the router-
         id ceases to be one of the router's IP addresses.  Routers with
         multiple unnumbered interfaces MAY have multiple router-id's.
         Each unnumbered interface MUST be associated with a particular
         router-id.  This association MUST NOT change (even across
         reboots) without reconfiguration of the router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            This specification does not allow for routers which do not
            have at least one IP address.  We do not view this as a
            serious limitation, since a router needs an IP address to
            meet the manageability requirements of Chapter [8] even if
            the router is connected only to point-to-point links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
         IMPLEMENTATION:
            One possible method of choosing the router-id that fulfills
            this requirement is to use the numerically smallest (or
            greatest) IP address (treating the address as a 32-bit
            integer) that is assigned to the router.

         The IP header contains two reserved bits: one in the Type of
         Service byte and the other in the Flags field.  A router MUST
         NOT set either of these bits to one in datagrams originated by
         the router.  A router MUST NOT drop (refuse to receive or
         forward) a packet merely because one or more of these reserved
         bits has a non-zero value.
         DISCUSSION:
            Future revisions to the IP protocol may make use of these
            unused bits.  These rules are intended to ensure that these
            revisions can be deployed without having to simultaneously

         As stated in Section [5.2.2], a router MUST verify the IP

         Fragmentation, as described in [INTERNET:1], MUST be supported
         by a router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         When a router fragments an IP datagram, it SHOULD minimize the
         number of fragments.  When a router fragments an IP datagram,
         it MUST send the fragments in order.  A fragmentation method
         which may generate one IP fragment which is significantly
         smaller than the other MAY cause the first IP fragment to be
         the smaller one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            There are several fragmentation techniques in common use in
            the Internet.  One involves splitting the IP datagram into
            IP fragments with the first being MTU sized, and the others
            being approximately the same size, smaller than the MTU.
            The reason for this is twofold.  The first IP fragment in
            the sequence will be the effective MTU of the current path
            between the hosts, and the following IP fragments are sized
            to hopefully minimize the further fragmentation of the IP
            datagram.  Another technique is to split the IP datagram
            into MTU sized IP fragments, with the last fragment being
            the only one smaller, as per page 26 of [INTERNET:1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            A common trick used by some implementations of TCP/IP is to
            fragment an IP datagram into IP fragments that are no larger
            than 576 bytes when the IP datagram is to travel through a
            router.  In general, this allows the resulting IP fragments
            to pass the rest of the path without further fragmentation.
            This would, though, create more of a load on the destination
            host, since it would have a larger number of IP fragments to
            reassemble into one IP datagram.  It would also not be
            efficient on networks where the MTU only changes once, and
            stays much larger than 576 bytes (such as an 802.5 network
            with a MTU of 2048 or an Ethernet network with an MTU of
            1536).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            One other fragmentation technique discussed was splitting
            the IP datagram into approximately equal sized IP fragments,
            with the size being smaller than the next hop network's MTU.
            This is intended to minimize the number of fragments that
            would result from additional fragmentation further down the
            path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            In most cases, routers should try and create situations that
            will generate the lowest number of IP fragments possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Work with slow machines leads us to believe that if it is
            necessary to send small packets in a fragmentation scheme,
            sending the small IP fragment first maximizes the chance of
            a host with a slow interface of receiving all the fragments.

                 { 0, 0 }.  Two examples are BOOTP and ICMP Mask

                 depends on the ability to receive datagrams whose
                 source address is { 0, 0 }.  For most protocols,
                 however, it is best to ignore datagrams having a source
                 address of { 0, 0 } since they were probably generated
                 by a misconfigured host or router.  Thus, if a router
                 knows how to deal with a given datagram having a { 0, 0
                 } source address, the router MUST accept it.

            subnetted.  In that case, the rules of the second bullet do

         An IP router SHOULD satisfy the Host Requirements with respect
         to IP multicasting, as specified in Section 3.3.7 of [INTRO:2].
         An IP router SHOULD support local IP multicasting on all
         connected networks for which a mapping from Class D IP
         addresses to link-layer addresses has been specified (see the
         various IP-over-xxx specifications), and on all connected
         point-to-point links.  Support for local IP multicasting
         includes originating multicast datagrams, joining multicast
         groups and receiving multicast datagrams, and leaving multicast
         groups.  This implies support for all of [INTERNET:4] including
         IGMP (see Section [4.4]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            Although [INTERNET:4] is entitled Host Extensions for IP
            Multicasting, it applies to all IP systems, both hosts and
            routers.  In particular, since routers may join multicast
            groups, it is correct for them to perform the host part of
            IGMP, reporting their group memberships to any multicast
            routers that may be present on their attached networks
            (whether or not they themselves are multicast routers).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Some router protocols may specifically require support for
            IP multicasting (e.g., OSPF [ROUTE:1]), or may recommend it
            (e.g., ICMP Router Discovery [INTERNET:13]).

         In order to eliminate fragmentation or minimize it, it is
         desirable to know what is the path MTU along the path from the
         source to destination.  The path MTU is the minimum of the MTUs
         of each hop in the path.  [INTERNET:14] describes a technique
         for dynamically discovering the maximum transmission unit (MTU)
         of an arbitrary internet path.  For a path that passes through
         a router that does not support [INTERNET:14], this technique
         might not discover the correct Path MTU, but it will always
         choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases more
         accurate than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by older
         techniques or the current practice.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         When a router is originating an IP datagram, it SHOULD use the
         scheme described in [INTERNET:14] to limit the datagram's size.
         If the router's route to the datagram's destination was learned
         from a routing protocol that provides Path MTU information, the
         scheme described in [INTERNET:14] is still used, but the Path
         MTU information from the routing protocol SHOULD be used as the
         initial guess as to the Path MTU and also as an upper bound on
         the Path MTU.

         Under certain circumstances, it may be desirable to support

         as discontiguous subnetwork support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         IMPLEMENTATION:

         DISCUSSION:
            The Internet has been growing at a tremendous rate of late.
            This has been placing severe strains on the IP addressing
            technology.  A major factor in this strain is the strict IP
            Address class boundaries.  These make it difficult to
            efficiently size network numbers to their networks and
            aggregate several network numbers into a single route
            advertisement.  By eliminating the strict class boundaries
            of the IP address and treating each route as a {network

         If an ICMP message of unknown type is received, it MUST be

         When originating an ICMP message, the router MUST initialize

         Every ICMP error message includes the Internet header and at
         least the first 8 data bytes of the datagram that triggered the
         error.  More than 8 bytes MAY be sent, but the resulting ICMP
         datagram SHOULD have a length of less than or equal to 576
         bytes.  The returned IP header (and user data) MUST be
         identical to that which was received, except that the router is
         not required to undo any modifications to the IP header that
         are normally performed in forwarding that were performed before
         the error was detected (e.g., decrementing the TTL, updating
         options).  Note that the requirements of Section [4.3.3.5]
         supersede this requirement in some cases (i.e., for a Parameter
         Problem message, if the problem  is in a modified field, the

         Except where this document specifies otherwise, the IP source
         address in an ICMP message originated by the router MUST be one
         of the IP addresses associated with the physical interface over
         which the ICMP message is transmitted.  If the interface has no

            These rules aim to prevent the broadcast storms that have
            resulted from routers or hosts returning ICMP error messages
            in response to broadcast packets.  For example, a broadcast
            UDP packet to a non-existent port could trigger a flood of
            ICMP Destination Unreachable datagrams from all devices that
            do not have a client for that destination port.  On a large
            Ethernet, the resulting collisions can render the network

            some devices violate this rule.  To be certain to detect
            broadcast packets, therefore, routers are required to check
            for a link-layer broadcast as well as an IP-layer address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">

            This requires that the link layer inform the IP layer when a

         A router which sends ICMP Source Quench messages MUST be able
         to limit the rate at which the messages can be generated.  A
         router SHOULD also be able to limit the rate at which it sends
         other sorts of ICMP error messages (Destination Unreachable,
         Redirect, Time Exceeded, Parameter Problem).  The rate limit
         parameters SHOULD be settable as part of the configuration of
         the router.  How the limits are applied (e.g., per router or
         per interface) is left to the implementor's discretion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            Two problems for a router sending ICMP error message are:
            (1)  The consumption of bandwidth on the reverse path, and<br>
            (2)  The use of router resources (e.g., memory, CPU time)<br>

            To help solve these problems a router can limit the
            frequency with which it generates ICMP error messages.  For
            similar reasons, a router may limit the frequency at which
            some other sorts of messages, such as ICMP Echo Replies, are
            generated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
         IMPLEMENTATION:
            Various mechanisms have been used or proposed for limiting
            the rate at which ICMP messages are sent:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            (1)  Count-based - for example, send an ICMP error message<br>
                 for every N dropped packets overall or per given source
                 host.  This mechanism might be appropriate for ICMP
                 Source Quench, but probably not for other types of ICMP
                 messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            (2)  Timer-based - for example, send an ICMP error message<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            (3)  Bandwidth-based - for example, limit the rate at which<br>

         the destination network specified in the packet but the TOS
         specified for the routes is neither the default TOS (0000) nor<br>
         the TOS of the packet that the router is attempting to route,

            or more paths to the destination, but none of those paths

         log the subnet mask and the sender's IP address.  A router MUST
         NOT use the contents of an ICMP Address Mask Reply to determine
         the correct subnet mask.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Because hosts may not be able to learn the subnet mask if a
         router is down when the host boots up, a router MAY broadcast a
         gratuitous ICMP Address Mask Reply on each of its logical
         interfaces after it has configured its own subnet masks.
         However, this feature can be dangerous in environments which
         use variable length subnet masks.  Therefore, if this feature
         is implemented, gratuitous Address Mask Replies MUST NOT be
         broadcast over any logical interface(s) which either:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         o  Are not configured to send gratuitous Address Mask Replies.
            Each logical interface MUST have a configuration parameter
            controlling this, and that parameter MUST default to not
            sending the gratuitous Address Mask Replies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         o  Share the same IP network number and physical interface but

         or the { <Network-number>, -1 } form (on non-subnetted

         broadcast Address Mask Replies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            The ability to disable sending Address Mask Replies by
            routers is required at a few sites which intentionally lie
            to their hosts about the subnet mask.  The need for this is
            expected to go away as more and more hosts become compliant
            with the Host Requirements standards.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            The reason for both the second bullet above and the
            requirement about which IP broadcast address to use is to

            use on the same physical network.

   This section describes the process of forwarding packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   FORWARDING WALK-THROUGH</h3></a>

   There is no separate specification of the forwarding function in IP.
   Instead, forwarding is covered by the protocol specifications for the
   internet layer protocols ([INTERNET:1], [INTERNET:2], [INTERNET:3],
   [INTERNET:8], and [ROUTE:11]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.1"><h4>5.2.1   Forwarding Algorithm</h4></a>

      Since none of the primary protocol documents describe the
      forwarding algorithm in any detail, we present it here.  This is
      just a general outline, and omits important details, such as
      handling of congestion, that are dealt with in later sections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      It is not required that an implementation follow exactly the
      algorithms given in sections [5.2.1.1], [5.2.1.2], and [5.2.1.3].
      Much of the challenge of writing router software is to maximize
      the rate at which the router can forward packets while still
      achieving the same effect of the algorithm.  Details of how to do
      that are beyond the scope of this document, in part because they
      are heavily dependent on the architecture of the router.  Instead,
      we merely point out the order dependencies among the steps:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  A router MUST verify the IP header, as described in section<br>
           [5.2.2], before performing any actions based on the contents
           of the header.  This allows the router to detect and discard
           bad packets before the expenditure of other resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  Processing of certain IP options requires that the router<br>
           insert its IP address into the option.  As noted in Section
           [5.2.4], the address inserted MUST be the address of the
           logical interface on which the packet is sent or the router's
           router-id if the packet is sent over an unnumbered interface.
           Thus, processing of these options cannot be completed until
           after the output interface is chosen.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (3)  The router cannot check and decrement the TTL before checking<br>
           whether the packet should be delivered to the router itself,
           for reasons mentioned in Section [4.2.2.9].
      (4)  More generally, when a packet is delivered locally to the<br>
           router, its IP header MUST NOT be modified in any way (except
           that a router may be required to insert a timestamp into any
           Timestamp options in the IP header).  Thus, before the router
           determines whether the packet is to be delivered locally to
           the router, it cannot update the IP header in any way that it
           is not prepared to undo.

         This section covers the general forwarding algorithm.  This
         algorithm applies to all forms of packets to be forwarded:
         unicast, multicast, and broadcast.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
         (1)  The router receives the IP packet (plus additional<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (2)  The router validates the IP header, as described in<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (3)  The router performs most of the processing of any IP<br>
              options.  As described in Section [5.2.4], some IP options
              require additional processing after the routing decision
              has been made.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (4)  The router examines the destination IP address of the IP<br>
              datagram, as described in Section [5.2.3], to determine
              how it should continue to process the IP datagram.  There
              are three possibilities:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  The IP datagram is destined for the router, and should
                 be queued for local delivery, doing reassembly if
                 needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  The IP datagram is not destined for the router, and
                 should be queued for forwarding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  The IP datagram should be queued for forwarding, but (a

         Since the local delivery case is well-covered by [INTRO:2], the

              in more detail in Section [5.2.4].  This procedure also

              If the router supports administrative constraints on
              forwarding, such as those described in Section [5.3.9],
              those constraints must be satisfied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (7)  The forwarder decrements (by at least one) and checks the<br>

              method for determining the proper receiving interface
              depends on the multicast routing algorithm(s) in use. In
              one of the simplest algorithms, reverse path forwarding

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (5)  The IP total length field must be at least 4 * IP header<br>

      despite the above rule, the router MAY respond with an ICMP
      Parameter Problem message, whose pointer points at the IP header
      length field (if it failed the fourth test) or the IP total length
      field (if it failed the fifth test).  However, it still MUST

      Furthermore, if a router can truly classify a packet as being some
      other version of IP then it ought not treat that packet as an
      error packet within the context of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      IMPLEMENTATION:
         It is desirable for purposes of error reporting, though not
         always entirely possible, to determine why a header was
         invalid.  There are four possible reasons:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         o  The Link Layer truncated the IP header

         o  The datagram is using a version of IP other than the
            standard one (version 4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         o  The IP header has been corrupted in transit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         o  The sender generated an illegal IP header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         It is probably desirable to perform the checks in the order
         listed, since we believe that this ordering is most likely to
         correctly categorize the cause of the error.  For purposes of
         error reporting, it may also be desirable to check if a packet
         which fails these tests has an IP version number equal to 6.
         If it does, the packet is probably an ST-II datagram and should
         be treated as such.  ST-II is described in [FORWARD:1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Additionally, the router SHOULD verify that the packet length
      reported by the Link Layer is at least as large as the IP total
      length recorded in the packet's IP header.  If it appears that the
      packet has been truncated, the packet MUST be discarded, the error
      SHOULD be logged, and the router SHOULD respond with an ICMP
      Parameter Problem message whose pointer points at the IP total
      length field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         Because any higher layer protocol which concerns itself with
         data corruption will detect truncation of the packet data when
         it reaches its final destination, it is not absolutely
         necessary for routers to perform the check suggested above in
         order to maintain protocol correctness.  However, by making
         this check a router can simplify considerably the task of
         determining which hop in the path is truncating the packets.
         It will also reduce the expenditure of resources down-stream
         from the router in that down-stream systems will not need to
         deal with the packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Finally, if the destination address in the IP header is not one of
      the addresses of the router, the router SHOULD verify that the
      packet does not contain a Strict Source and Record Route option.
      If a packet fails this test, the router SHOULD log the error and
      SHOULD respond with an ICMP Parameter Problem error with the
      pointer pointing at the offending packet's IP destination address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         Some people might suggest that the router should respond with a
         Bad Source Route message instead of a Parameter Problem
         message.  However, when a packet fails this test, it usually
         indicates a protocol error by the previous hop router, whereas
         Bad Source Route would suggest that the source host had
         requested a nonexistent or broken path through the network.

	<a name="section-5.2.3"><h4>5.2.3   Local Delivery Decision</h4></a>

      When a router receives an IP packet, it must decide whether the
      packet is addressed to the router (and should be delivered
      locally) or the packet is addressed to another system (and should
      be handled by the forwarder).  There is also a hybrid case, where
      certain IP broadcasts and IP multicasts are both delivered locally
      and forwarded.  A router MUST determine which of the these three
      cases applies using the following rules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  An unexpired source route option is one whose pointer value
         does not point past the last entry in the source route.  If the

         in the option is advanced until either the pointer does point
         past the last address in the option or else the next address is
         not one of the router's own addresses.  In the latter (normal)
         case, the  packet is forwarded (and not delivered locally)
         regardless of the rules below.

            associated with the physical interface on which the packet
            arrived is a member of the destination multicast group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The packet is delivered locally if the packet's destination
         address is an IP broadcast address (other than a limited
         broadcast address) that addresses at least one of the logical
         interfaces associated with the physical interface on which the
         packet arrived.  The packet is ALSO passed to the forwarder
         unless the link on which the packet arrived uses an IP
         encapsulation that does not encapsulate broadcasts differently
         than unicasts (e.g. by using different Link Layer destination
         addresses).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The packet is passed to the forwarder in all other cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         The purpose of the requirement in the last sentence of the
         fourth bullet is to deal with a directed broadcast to another
         net or subnet on the same physical cable.  Normally, this works
         as expected: the sender sends the broadcast to the router as a
         Link Layer unicast.  The router notes that it arrived as a
         unicast, and therefore must be destined for a different logical
         net (or subnet) than the sender sent it on.  Therefore, the
         router can safely send it as a Link Layer broadcast out the
         same (physical) interface over which it arrived.  However, if
         the router can't tell whether the packet was received as a Link
         Layer unicast, the sentence ensures that the router does the
         safe but wrong thing rather than the unsafe but right thing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
      IMPLEMENTATION:
         As described in Section [5.3.4], packets received as Link Layer
         broadcasts are generally not forwarded.  It may be advantageous
         to avoid passing to the forwarder packets it would later
         discard because of the rules in that section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Some Link Layers (either because of the hardware or because of
         special code in the drivers) can deliver to the router copies
         of all Link Layer broadcasts and multicasts it transmits.  Use
         of this feature can simplify the implementation of cases where
         a packet has to both be passed to the forwarder and delivered
         locally, since forwarding the packet will automatically cause
         the router to receive a copy of the packet that it can then
         deliver locally.  One must use care in these circumstances in
         order to prevent treating a received loop-back packet as a
         normal packet that was received (and then being subject to the
         rules of forwarding, etc etc).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Even in the absence of such a Link Layer, it is of course
         hardly necessary to make a copy of an entire packet in order to
         queue it both for forwarding and for local delivery, though
         care must be taken with fragments, since reassembly is
         performed on locally delivered packets but not on forwarded
         packets.  One simple scheme is to associate a flag with each
         packet on the router's output queue which indicates whether it
         should be queued for local delivery after it has been sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.4"><h4>5.2.4   Determining the Next Hop Address</h4></a>

      When a router is going to forward a packet, it must determine
      whether it can send it directly to its destination, or whether it
      needs to pass it through another router.  If the latter, it needs
      to determine which router to use.  This section explains how these
      determinations are made.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This section makes use of the following definitions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  LSRR - IP Loose Source and Record Route option

      o  SSRR - IP Strict Source and Record Route option

      o  Source Route Option - an LSRR or an SSRR

      o  Ultimate Destination Address - where the packet is being sent
         to: the last address in the source route of a source-routed
         packet, or the destination address in the IP header of a non-
         source-routed packet

      o  Adjacent - reachable without going through any IP routers

      o  Next Hop Address - the IP address of the adjacent host or
         router to which the packet should be sent next

      o  Immediate Destination Address - the ultimate destination
         address, except in source routed packets, where it is the next
         address specified in the source route

      o  Immediate Destination - the node, system, router, end-system,
         or whatever that is addressed by the Immediate Destination
         Address.

         If the destination address in the IP header is one of the
         addresses of the router and the packet contains a Source Route
         Option, the Immediate Destination Address is the address
         pointed at by the pointer in that option if the pointer does
         not point past the end of the option.  Otherwise, the Immediate
         Destination Address is the same as the IP destination address
         in the IP header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router MUST use the Immediate Destination Address, not the

         EDITOR'S COMMENTS:
            Note that this section has been extensively rewritten.  The
            original document indicated that Phil Almquist wished to
            revise this section to conform to his "Ruminations on the
            Next Hop" document.  I am under the assumption that the
            working group generally agreed with this goal; there was an
            editor's note from Phil that remained in this document to
            that effect, and the RoNH document contains a "mandatory
            RRWG algorithm".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            So, I have taken said algorithm from RoNH and moved it into
            here.
            Additional useful or interesting information from RoNH has
            been extracted and placed into an appendix to this note.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The router applies the algorithm in the previous section to
         determine if the Immediate Destination Address is adjacent.  If
         so, the next hop address is the same as the Immediate
         Destination Address.  Otherwise, the packet must be forwarded
         through another router to reach its Immediate Destination.  The
         selection of this router is the topic of this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         If the packet contains an SSRR, the router MUST discard the
         packet and reply with an ICMP Bad Source Route error.
         Otherwise, the router looks up the Immediate Destination
         Address in its routing table to determine an appropriate next
         hop address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            Per the IP specification, a Strict Source Route must specify
            a sequence of nodes through which the packet must traverse;
            the packet must go from one node of the source route to the
            next, traversing intermediate networks only.  Thus, if the
            router is not adjacent to the next step of the source route,
            the source route can not be fulfilled.  Therefore, the ICMP
            Bad Source Route error.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The goal of the next-hop selection process is to examine the
         entries in the router's Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and
         select the best route (if there is one) for the packet from
         those available in the FIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Conceptually, any route lookup algorithm starts out with a set
         of candidate routes which consists of the entire contents of
         the FIB.  The algorithm consists of a series of steps which
         discard routes from the set.  These steps are referred to as
         Pruning Rules.  Normally, when the algorithm terminates there
         is exactly one route remaining in the set.  If the set ever
         becomes empty, the packet is discarded because the destination
         is unreachable.  It is also possible for the algorithm to
         terminate when more than one route remains in the set.  In this
         case, the router may arbitrarily discard all but one of them,
         or may perform "load-splitting" by choosing whichever of the
         routes has been least recently used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         With the exception of rule 3 (Weak TOS), a router MUST use the
         following Pruning Rules when selecting a next hop for a packet.
         If a router does consider TOS when making next-hop decisions,
         the Rule 3 must be applied in the order indicated below.  These
         rules MUST be (conceptually) applied to the FIB in the order
         that they are presented.  (For some historical perspective,
         additional pruning rules, and other common algorithms in use,
         see Appendix E).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            Rule 3 is optional in that Section [5.3.2] says that a
            router only SHOULD consider TOS when making forwarding
            decisions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
         (1)  Basic Match<br>
              This rule discards any routes to destinations other than
              the Immediate Destination Address of the packet.  For
              example, if a packet's Immediate Destination Address is
              36.144.2.5, this step would discard a route to net
              128.12.0.0 but would retain any routes to net 36.0.0.0,
              any routes to subnet 36.144.0.0, and any default routes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              More precisely, we assume that each route has a
              destination attribute, called route.dest, and a
              corresponding mask, called route.mask, to specify which
              bits of route.dest are significant.  The Immediate
              Destination Address of the packet being forwarded is
              ip.dest.  This rule discards all routes from the set of
              candidate routes except those for which (route.dest &
              route.mask) = (ip.dest & route.mask).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (2)  Longest Match<br>
              Longest Match is a refinement of Basic Match, described
              above.  After Basic Match pruning is performed, the
              remaining routes are examined to determine the maximum
              number of bits set in any of their route.mask attributes.
              The step then discards from the set of candidate routes
              any routes which have fewer than that maximum number of
              bits set in their route.mask attributes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              For example, if a packet's Immediate Destination Address
              is 36.144.2.5 and there are  {route.dest, route.mask}
              pairs of {36.144.2.0, 255.255.255.0}, {36.144.0.5,
              255.255.0.255}, {36.144.0.0, 255.255.0.0}, and {36.0.0.0,
              255.0.0.0}, then this rule would keep only the first two
              pairs; {36.144.2.0, 255.255.255.0} and {36.144.0.5,
              255.255.0.255}.
         (3)  Weak TOS<br>
              Each route has a type of service attribute, called
              route.tos, whose possible values are assumed to be
              identical to those used in the TOS field of the IP header.
              Routing protocols which distribute TOS information fill in
              route.tos appropriately in routes they add to the FIB;
              routes from other routing protocols are treated as if they
              have the default TOS (0000).  The TOS field in the IP<br>
              header of the packet being routed is called ip.tos.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              The set of candidate routes is examined to determine if it
              contains any routes for which route.tos = ip.tos.  If so,
              all routes except those for which route.tos = ip.tos are
              discarded.  If not, all routes except those for which
              route.tos = 0000 are discarded from the set of candidate
              routes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              Additional discussion of routing based on Weak TOS may be
              found in [ROUTE:11].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              DISCUSSION:
                 The effect of this rule is to select only those routes
                 which have a TOS that matches the TOS requested in the
                 packet.  If no such routes exist then routes with the
                 default TOS are considered.  Routes with a non-default
                 TOS that is not the TOS requested in the packet are
                 never used, even if such routes are the only available
                 routes that go to the packet's destination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (4)  Best Metric<br>
              Each route has a metric attribute, called route.metric,
              and a routing domain identifier, called route.domain.
              Each member of the set of candidate routes is compared
              with each other member of the set.  If route.domain is
              equal for the two routes and route.metric is strictly
              inferior for one when compared with the other, then the
              one with the inferior metric is discarded from the set.
              The determination of inferior is usually by a simple
              arithmetic comparison, though some protocols may have
              structured metrics requiring more complex comparisons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (5)  Vendor Policy<br>
              Vendor Policy is sort of a catch-all to make up for the
              fact that the previously listed rules are often inadequate
              to chose from among the possible routes.  Vendor Policy
              pruning rules are extremely vendor-specific.  See section
              [5.2.4.4].
         This algorithm has two distinct disadvantages.  Presumably, a
         router implementor might develop techniques to deal with these
         disadvantages and make them a part of the Vendor Policy pruning
         rule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (1)  IS-IS and OSPF route classes are not directly handled.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         It is also worth noting a deficiency in the way that TOS is
         supported: routing protocols which support TOS are implicitly
         preferred when forwarding packets which have non-zero TOS
         values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The Basic Match and Longest Match pruning rules generalize the
         treatment of a number of particular types of routes.  These
         routes are selected in the following, decreasing, order of
         preference:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (1)  Host Route: This is a route to a specific end system.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (2)  Subnetwork Route: This is a route to a particular subnet<br>

         may still remain.  A router has several options when this

         routes from routing domains which are not considered

            all hosts on a specified remote network.  Using a network
            rather than a host Redirect may economize slightly on
            network traffic and on host routing table storage.  However,
            the savings are not significant, and subnets create an
            ambiguity about the subnet mask to be used to interpret a

         Code 3 redirects.  A router MUST send a Code 1 Redirect in

	<a name="section-5.3.1"><h4>5.3.1   Time to Live (TTL)</h4></a>

      The Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header is defined to be a
      timer limiting the lifetime of a datagram.  It is an 8-bit field
      and the units are seconds.  Each router (or other module) that
      handles a packet MUST decrement the TTL by at least one, even if
      the elapsed time was much less than a second.  Since this is very
      often the case, the TTL is effectively a hop count limit on how
      far a datagram can propagate through the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When a router forwards a packet, it MUST reduce the TTL by at
      least one.  If it holds a packet for more than one second, it MAY
      decrement the TTL by one for each second.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the TTL is reduced to zero (or less), the packet MUST be
      discarded, and if the destination is not a multicast address the
      router MUST send an ICMP Time Exceeded message, Code 0 (TTL
      Exceeded in Transit) message to the source.  Note that a router
      MUST NOT discard an IP unicast or broadcast packet with a non-zero
      TTL merely because it can predict that another router on the path
      to the packet's final destination will decrement the TTL to zero.
      However, a router MAY do so for IP multicasts, in order to more
      efficiently implement IP multicast's expanding ring search
      algorithm (see [INTERNET:4]).
      DISCUSSION:
         The IP TTL is used, somewhat schizophrenically, as both a hop
         count limit and a time limit.  Its hop count function is
         critical to ensuring that routing problems can't melt down the
         network by causing packets to loop infinitely in the network.
         The time limit function is used by transport protocols such as
         TCP to ensure reliable data transfer.  Many current
         implementations treat TTL as a pure hop count, and in parts of
         the Internet community there is a strong sentiment that the
         time limit function should instead be performed by the
         transport protocols that need it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         In this specification, we have reluctantly decided to follow
         the strong belief among the router vendors that the time limit
         function should be optional.  They argued that implementation
         of the time limit function is difficult enough that it is
         currently not generally done.  They further pointed to the lack
         of documented cases where this shortcut has caused TCP to
         corrupt data (of course, we would expect the problems created
         to be rare and difficult to reproduce, so the lack of
         documented cases provides little reassurance that there haven't
         been a number of undocumented cases).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         IP multicast notions such as the expanding ring search may not
         work as expected unless the TTL is treated as a pure hop count.
         The same thing is somewhat true of traceroute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         ICMP Time Exceeded messages are required because the traceroute
         diagnostic tool depends on them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Thus, the tradeoff is between severely crippling, if not

      The Type-of-Service byte in the IP header is divided into three

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A router MUST maintain a TOS value for each route in its routing

         is now mandated by the Requirements for Internet Hosts RFCs
         ([INTRO:2] and [INTRO:3]).  Support for TOS in routers may
         become a MUST in the future, but is a SHOULD for now until we
         get more experience with it and can better judge both its

	<a name="section-5.3.3"><h4>5.3.3   IP Precedence</h4></a>

      This section specifies requirements and guidelines for appropriate
      processing of the IP Precedence field in routers.  Precedence is a
      scheme for allocating resources in the network based on the
      relative importance of different traffic flows.  The IP
      specification defines specific values to be used in this field for
      various types of traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The basic mechanisms for precedence processing in a router are
      preferential resource allocation, including both precedence-
      ordered queue service and precedence-based congestion control, and
      selection of Link Layer priority features.  The router also
      selects the IP precedence for routing, management and control
      traffic it originates.  For a more extensive discussion of IP
      Precedence and its implementation see [FORWARD:6].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Precedence-ordered queue service, as discussed in this section,
      includes but is not limited to the queue for the forwarding
      process and queues for outgoing links.  It is intended that a
      router supporting precedence should also use the precedence
      indication at whatever points in its processing are concerned with
      allocation of finite resources, such as packet buffers or Link
      Layer connections.  The set of such points is implementation-
      dependent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         Although the Precedence field was originally provided for use
         in DOD systems where large traffic surges or major damage to
         the network are viewed as inherent threats, it has useful
         applications for many non-military IP networks.  Although the
         traffic handling capacity of networks has grown greatly in
         recent years, the traffic generating ability of the users has
         also grown, and network overload conditions still occur at
         times.  Since IP-based routing and management protocols have
         become more critical to the successful operation of the
         Internet, overloads present two additional risks to the
         network:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (1)  High delays may result in routing protocol packets being<br>
              lost.  This may cause the routing protocol to falsely
              deduce a topology change and propagate this false
              information to other routers.  Not only can this cause
              routes to oscillate, but an extra processing burden may be
              placed on other routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (2)  High delays may interfere with the use of network<br>
              management tools to analyze and perhaps correct or relieve
              the problem in the network that caused the overload
              condition to occur.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Implementation and appropriate use of the Precedence mechanism

         Routers SHOULD implement precedence-ordered queue service.
         Precedence-ordered queue service means that when a packet is
         selected for output on a (logical) link, the packet of highest
         precedence that has been queued for that link is sent.  Routers
         that implement precedence-ordered queue service MUST also have
         a configuration option to suppress precedence-ordered queue
         service in the Internet Layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Any router MAY implement other policy-based throughput
         management procedures that result in other than strict
         precedence ordering, but it MUST be configurable to suppress

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         As detailed in Section [5.3.6], routers that implement

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            Some research questions the workability of the priority

            have faulty implementations of the link layer priority

            in case such problems show up in a network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            On the other hand, there are proposals to use novel queueing
            strategies to implement special services such as low-delay

            support them need further research and experimentation
            before they are put into widespread use in the Internet.
            Since these requirements are intended to encourage (but not

                 only a problem if another path which is unaffected by
                 the cutoff exists between the communicating points.
                 Proposed ways of avoiding this problem include
                 providing some minimum bandwidth to all precedence

      There are two major types of IP broadcast addresses; limited
      broadcast and directed broadcast.  In addition, there are three
      subtypes of directed broadcast; a broadcast directed to a
      specified network, a broadcast directed to a specified subnetwork,
      and a broadcast directed to all subnets of a specified network.
      Classification by a router of a broadcast into one of these
      categories depends on the broadcast address and on the router's
      understanding (if any) of the subnet structure of the destination
      network.  The same broadcast will be classified differently by
      different routers.
      A limited IP broadcast address is defined to be all-ones: { -1, -1
      } or 255.255.255.255.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A net-directed broadcast is composed of the network portion of the
      IP address with a local part of all-ones, { <Network-number>, -1

      net.255.255.255, a Class B net broadcast address is
      net.net.255.255 and a Class C net broadcast address is
      net.net.net.255 where net is a byte of the network address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An all-subnets-directed broadcast is composed of the network part
      of the IP address with a subnet and a host part of all-ones, {
      <Network-number>, -1, -1 }.  For example, an all-subnets broadcast
      on a subnetted class B network is net.net.255.255.  A network must
      be known to be subnetted and the subnet part must be all-ones
      before a broadcast can be classified as all-subnets-directed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A subnet-directed broadcast address is composed of the network and
      subnet part of the IP address with a host part of all-ones, {

      directed broadcast to subnet 2 of a class B network might be

            with an understanding of the subnet structure.  Therefore,
            in general, routers must forward directed broadcasts for
            networks they are not attached to and for which they do not
            understand the subnet structure.  One router may interpret

            Suppose that some corporation builds its corporate backbone

            connecting S1 to S2 and one connecting S2 to S3 (i.e. the
            links are R1-R2 and R2-R3).  So, if a host on a LAN at S1
            sends a All Subnets Directed Broadcast, R1 will forward the
            broadcast over the R1-R2 link to R2.  R2 will forward the
            broadcast to the LAN(s) connected to R2.  Since the PPP does
            not differentiate broadcast from non-broadcast frames, R2
            will NOT forward the broadcast onto the R2-R3 link.
            Therefore, the broadcast will not reach S3.

      Congestion in a network is loosely defined as a condition where
      demand for resources (usually bandwidth or CPU time) exceeds
      capacity.  Congestion avoidance tries to prevent demand from
      exceeding capacity, while congestion recovery tries to restore an
      operative state.  It is possible for a router to contribute to
      both of these mechanisms.  A great deal of effort has been spent
      studying the problem.  The reader is encouraged to read
      [FORWARD:2] for a survey of the work.  Important papers on the
      subject include [FORWARD:3], [FORWARD:4], [FORWARD:5], and
      [INTERNET:10], among others.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The amount of storage that router should have available to handle
      peak instantaneous demand when hosts use reasonable congestion
      policies, such as described in [FORWARD:5], is a function of the
      product of the bandwidth of the link times the path delay of the
      flows using the link, and therefore storage should increase as
      this Bandwidth*Delay product increases.  The exact function
      relating storage capacity to probability of discard is not known.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When a router receives a packet beyond its storage capacity it
      must (by definition, not by decree) discard it or some other

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A router MAY discard the packet it has just received; this is the
      simplest but not the best policy.  It is considered better policy

      determine which packet to discard.

         general purpose hosts, terminal servers, etc.) can achieve an
         approximation of this rule by protecting packets whose source
         or destination is the router itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Advanced methods of congestion control include a notion of

         A router MUST implement support for source route options in

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            The ability to source route datagrams through the Internet
            is important to various network diagnostic tools.  However,
            in a few rare cases, source routing may be used to bypass
            administrative and security controls within a network.
            Specifically, those cases where manipulation of routing
            tables is used to provide administrative separation in lieu
            of other methods such as packet filtering may be vulnerable

   An Autonomous System (AS) is defined as a set of routers all

   set of routing policies.  Interior gateway protocols (IGPs) are used
   to distribute routing information inside of an AS (i.e.  intra-AS

   information between ASs (i.e. inter-AS routing).

      core/stub autonomous system routing model using EGP and various
      interior routing protocols.  It is even more important with the
      demise of a central, trusted core.

         Dealing with changes in topology: [ROUTE:3], pp. 11

              An implementation of RIP MUST provide a means for timing
              out routes.  Since messages are occasionally lost,
              implementations MUST NOT invalidate a route based on a
              single missed update.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              Implementations MUST by default wait six times the update
              interval before invalidating a route.  A router MAY have
              configuration options to alter this value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              DISCUSSION:
                 It is important to routing stability that all routers
                 in a RIP autonomous system use similar timeout value
                 for invalidating routes, and therefore it is important
                 that an implementation default to the timeout value
                 specified in the RIP specification.  However, that
                 timeout value is overly conservative in environments
                 where packet loss is reasonably rare.  In such an
                 environment, a network manager may wish to be able to
                 decrease the timeout period in order to promote faster
                 recovery from failures.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
              IMPLEMENTATION:
                 There is a very simple mechanism which a router may use
                 to meet the requirement to invalidate routes promptly
                 after they time out.  Whenever the router scans the
                 routing table to see if any routes have timed out, it
                 also notes the age of the least recently updated route
                 which has not yet timed out.  Subtracting this age from
                 the timeout period gives the amount of time until the
                 router again needs to scan the table for timed out
                 routes.

         Split Horizon: [ROUTE:3], pp. 14-15

              An implementation of RIP MUST implement split horizon, a
              scheme used for avoiding problems caused by including
              routes in updates sent to the router from which they were
              learned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              An implementation of RIP SHOULD implement Split horizon

              includes routes learned from a router sent to that router,
              but sets their metric to infinity.  Because of the routing
              overhead which may be incurred by implementing split
              horizon with poisoned reverse, implementations MAY include
              an option to select whether poisoned reverse is in effect.
              An implementation SHOULD limit the period of time in which
              it sends reverse routes at an infinite metric.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              IMPLEMENTATION:

                 the period of time for which poisoned reverse is
                 applied to a route.  The first algorithm is more
                 complex but does a more complete job of limiting
                 poisoned reverse to only those cases where it is
                 necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 The goal of both algorithms is to ensure that poison
                 reverse is done for any destination whose route has
                 changed in the last Route Lifetime (typically 180
                 seconds), unless it can be sure that the previous route
                 used the same output interface.  The Route Lifetime is
                 used because that is the amount of time RIP will keep
                 around an old route before declaring it stale.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 The time intervals (and derived variables) used in the

         The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-AS routing
         protocol which exchanges network reachability information with
         other BGP speakers. The information for a network includes the
         complete list of ASs that traffic must transit to reach that
         network. This information can then be used to insure loop-free
         paths.  This information is sufficient to construct a graph of
         AS connectivity from which routing loops may be pruned and some
         policy decisions at the AS level may be enforced.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         BGP is defined by [ROUTE:4].  [ROUTE:5] specifies the proper
         usage of BGP in the Internet, and provides some useful

         provide additional useful information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         To comply with Section [8.3] of this memo, a router which
         implements BGP MUST also implement the BGP MIB [MGT:15].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         To characterize the set of policy decisions that can be
         enforced using BGP, one must focus on the rule that an AS
         advertises to its neighbor ASs only those routes that it itself
         uses.  This rule reflects the hop-by-hop routing paradigm
         generally used throughout the current Internet.  Note that some
         policies cannot be supported by the hop-by-hop routing paradigm
         and thus require techniques such as source routing to enforce.
         For example, BGP does not enable one AS to send traffic to a
         neighbor AS intending that that traffic take a different route
         from that taken by traffic originating in the neighbor AS.  On
         the other hand, BGP can support any policy conforming to the
         hop-by-hop routing paradigm.

         The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) specifies an EGP which is
         used to exchange reachability information between routers of
         the same or differing autonomous systems. EGP is not considered
         a routing protocol since there is no standard interpretation
         (i.e. metric) for the distance fields in the EGP update
         message, so distances are comparable only among routers of the
         same AS.  It is however designed to provide high-quality
         reachability information, both about neighbor routers and about
         routes to non-neighbor routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         EGP is defined by [ROUTE:6].  An implementor almost certainly
         wants to read [ROUTE:7] and [ROUTE:8] as well, for they contain
         useful explanations and background material.
         DISCUSSION:
            The present EGP specification has serious limitations, most
            importantly a restriction which limits routers to
            advertising only those networks which are reachable from
            within the router's autonomous system.  This restriction
            against propagating third party EGP information is to
            prevent long-lived routing loops.  This effectively limits
            EGP to a two-level hierarchy.

      It is possible to exchange routing information between two

      routing protocols.  The most common way of doing this is to run
      both interior protocols independently in one of the border routers
      with an exchange of route information between the two processes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      As with the exchange of information from an EGP to an IGP, without

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.4"><h3>7.4   STATIC ROUTING</h3></a>

   Static routing provides a means of explicitly defining the next hop
   from a router for a particular destination.  A router SHOULD provide
   a means for defining a static route to a destination, where the
   destination is defined by an address and an address mask.  The
   mechanism SHOULD also allow for a metric to be specified for each
   static route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A router which supports a dynamic routing protocol MUST allow static
   routes to be defined with any metric valid for the routing protocol
   used.  The router MUST provide the ability for the user to specify a
   list of static routes which may or may not be propagated via the
   routing protocol.  In addition, a router SHOULD support the following
   additional information if it supports a routing protocol that could
   make use of the information. They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  TOS,

   o  Subnet mask, or

   o  A metric specific to a given routing protocol that can import the
      route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DISCUSSION:
      We intend that one needs to support only the things useful to the
      given routing protocol.  The need for TOS should not require the
      vendor to implement the other parts if they are not used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Whether a router prefers a static route over a dynamic route (or vice
   versa) or whether the associated metrics are used to choose between
   conflicting static and dynamic routes SHOULD be configurable for each
   static route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A router MUST allow a metric to be assigned to a static route for
   each routing domain that it supports.  Each such metric MUST be
   explicitly assigned to a specific routing domain.  For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        route 36.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 via 192.19.200.3 rip metric 3

        route 36.21.0.0 255.255.0.0 via 192.19.200.4 ospf inter-area

        3 4 5

   DISCUSSION:
      It has been suggested that, ideally, static routes should have
      preference values rather than metrics (since metrics can only be
      compared with metrics of other routes in the same routing domain,
      the metric of a static route could only be compared with metrics
      of other static routes).  This is contrary to some current
      implementations, where static routes really do have metrics, and
      those metrics are used to determine whether a particular dynamic
      route overrides the static route to the same destination.  Thus,
      this document uses the term metric rather than preference.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This technique essentially makes the static route into a RIP
      route, or an OSPF route (or whatever, depending on the domain of
      the metric).  Thus, the route lookup algorithm of that domain
      applies.  However, this is NOT route leaking, in that coercing a
      static route into a dynamic routing domain does not authorize the
      router to redistribute the route into the dynamic routing domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For static routes not put into a specific routing domain, the
      route lookup algorithm is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  Basic match<br>

      (2)  Longest match<br>

      (3)  Weak TOS (if TOS supported)<br>

      (4)  Best metric (where metric are implementation-defined)<br>

      The last step may not be necessary, but it's useful in the case
      where you want to have a primary static route over one interface
      and a secondary static route over an alternate interface, with
      failover to the alternate path if the interface for the primary
      route fails.
	<a name="section-7.5"><h3>7.5   FILTERING OF ROUTING INFORMATION</h3></a>

   Each router within a network makes forwarding decisions based upon
   information contained within its forwarding database.  In a simple
   network the contents of the database may be statically configured.
   As the network grows more complex, the need for dynamic updating of
   the forwarding database becomes critical to the efficient operation
   of the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the data flow through a network is to be as efficient as possible,
   it is necessary to provide a mechanism for controlling the
   propagation of the information a router uses to build its forwarding
   database.  This control takes the form of choosing which sources of
   routing information should be trusted and selecting which pieces of
   the information to believe.  The resulting forwarding database is a
   filtered version of the available routing information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to efficiency, controlling the propagation of routing
   information can reduce instability by preventing the spread of
   incorrect or bad routing information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In some cases local policy may require that complete routing
   information not be widely propagated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These filtering requirements apply only to non-SPF-based protocols

   distance vector protocols).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.5.1"><h4>7.5.1   Route Validation</h4></a>

      A router SHOULD log as an error any routing update advertising a
      route to network zero, subnet zero, or subnet -1, unless the

      values to encode special routes (such as default routes).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.5.2"><h4>7.5.2   Basic Route Filtering</h4></a>

      Filtering of routing information allows control of paths used by a
      router to forward packets it receives.  A router should be
      selective in which sources of routing information it listens to
      and what routes it believes.  Therefore, a router MUST provide the
      ability to specify:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  On which logical interfaces routing information will be
         accepted and which routes will be accepted from each logical
         interface.
      o  Whether all routes or only a default route is advertised on a
         logical interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Some routing protocols do not recognize logical interfaces as a
      source of routing information.  In such cases the router MUST
      provide the ability to specify

      o  from which other routers routing information will be accepted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For example, assume a router connecting one or more leaf networks
      to the main portion or backbone of a larger network.  Since each
      of the leaf networks has only one path in and out, the router can
      simply send a default route to them.  It advertises the leaf
      networks to the main network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.5.3"><h4>7.5.3   Advanced Route Filtering</h4></a>

      As the topology of a network grows more complex, the need for more

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Which logical interfaces or routers routing information
         (routes) will be accepted from and which routes will be

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In many situations it is desirable to assign a reliability

   Routers MUST be able to exchange routing information between separate

      Different IGPs use different metrics, requiring some translation

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There are at least two techniques for translation between

      metric.  The translation or tabular approach uses the metric in

      a function (such as adding a constant) or a table lookup.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Bi-directional exchange of routing information is dangerous

      through use of a split horizon rule, a no-third-party rule, or a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The exact physical nature of non-volatile storage is not

         made to a configuration parameter on the router would need to
         be propagated back to the file server holding the configuration
         file.  Alternatively, the SNMP operation would need to be
         directed to the file server, and then the change somehow
         propagated to the router.  The answer to this problem does not

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         This also places more requirements on the host holding the

	<a name="section-9.1.1"><h4>9.1.1   Introduction</h4></a>

      The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a UDP/IP-based protocol which
      allows a booting host to configure itself dynamically and without
      user supervision.  BOOTP provides a means to notify a host of its
      assigned IP address, the IP address of a boot server host, and the
      name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed ([APPL:1]).
      Other configuration information such as the local subnet mask, the
      local time offset, the addresses of default routers, and the
      addresses of various Internet servers can also be communicated to
      a host using BOOTP ([APPL:2]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.1.2"><h4>9.1.2   BOOTP Relay Agents</h4></a>

      In many cases, BOOTP clients and their associated BOOTP server(s)
      do not reside on the same IP network or subnet.  In such cases, a
      third-party agent is required to transfer BOOTP messages between
      clients and servers.  Such an agent was originally referred to as
      a BOOTP forwarding agent.  However, in order to avoid confusion
      with the IP forwarding function of a router, the name BOOTP relay
      agent has been adopted instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         A BOOTP relay agent performs a task which is distinct from a
         router's normal IP forwarding function.  While a router
         normally switches IP datagrams between networks more-or-less
         transparently, a BOOTP relay agent may more properly be thought
         to receive BOOTP messages as a final destination and then
         generate new BOOTP messages as a result.  One should resist the
         notion of simply forwarding a BOOTP message straight through
         like a regular packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This relay-agent functionality is most conveniently located in the
      routers which interconnect the clients and servers (although it
      may alternatively be located in a host which is directly connected
      to the client subnet).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A router MAY provide BOOTP relay-agent capability.  If it does, it
      MUST conform to the specifications in [APPL:3].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Section [5.2.3] discussed the circumstances under which a packet

This chapter supersedes any requirements stated in section 6.2 of

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Facilities to support operation and maintenance (O&M) activities form an
essential part of any router implementation.  Although these functions
do not seem to relate directly to interoperability, they are essential
to the network manager who must make the router interoperate and must

discussion of router initialization and of facilities to assist network
managers in securing and accounting for their networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.1"><h3>10.1   Introduction</h3></a>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Diagnosing hardware problems in the router's processor, in its
      network interfaces, or in its connected networks, modems, or
      communication lines.

   o  Installing new software.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Restarting or rebooting the router after a crash.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Configuring (or reconfiguring) the router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Detecting and diagnosing Internet problems such as congestion,
      routing loops, bad IP addresses, black holes, packet avalanches,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Changing network topology, either temporarily (e.g., to bypass a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Monitoring the status and performance of the routers and the
      connected networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Collecting traffic statistics for use in (Inter-)network planning.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Coordinating the above activities with appropriate vendors and
      telecommunications specialists.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Routers and their connected communication lines are often operated as
   a system by a centralized O&M organization.  This organization may
   maintain a (Inter-)network operation center, or NOC, to carry out its
   O&M functions.  It is essential that routers support remote control
   and monitoring from such a NOC through an Internet path, since
   routers might not be connected to the same network as their NOC.
   Since a network failure may temporarily preclude network access, many
   NOCs insist that routers be accessible for network management via an
   alternative means, often dialup modems attached to console ports on
   the routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since an IP packet traversing an internet will often use routers
   under the control of more than one NOC, Internet problem diagnosis
   will often involve cooperation of personnel of more than one NOC.  In
   some cases, the same router may need to be monitored by more than one
   NOC, but only if necessary, because excessive monitoring could impact
   a router's performance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The tools available for monitoring at a NOC may cover a wide range of
   sophistication. Current implementations include multi-window, dynamic
   displays of the entire router system. The use of AI techniques for
   automatic problem diagnosis is proposed for the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Router O&M facilities discussed here are only a part of the large and
   difficult problem of Internet management.  These problems encompass
   not only multiple management organizations, but also multiple
   protocol layers.  For example, at the current stage of evolution of
   the Internet architecture, there is a strong coupling between host
   TCP implementations and eventual IP-level congestion in the router
   system [OPER:1].  Therefore, diagnosis of congestion problems will
   sometimes require the monitoring of TCP statistics in hosts.  There
   are currently a number of R&D efforts in progress in the area of
   Internet management and more specifically router O&M. These R&D
   efforts have already produced standards for router O&M. This is also
   an area in which vendor creativity can make a significant
   contribution.

         routing to be ambiguous, and that implementors might be able to
         decrease their customer support costs by having routers
         prohibit or log such erroneous configurations.  However, at
         this time we do not require routers to make such checks because

      There has been a lot of discussion on how routers can and should

      centered around BOOTP and TFTP.  Currently, there are routers that
      boot with TFTP from the network.  There is no reason that BOOTP
      could not be used for locating the server that the boot image
      should be loaded from.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In general, BOOTP is a protocol used to boot end systems, and
      requires some stretching to accommodate its use with routers.  If
      a router is using BOOTP to locate the current boot host, it should
      send a BOOTP Request with its hardware address for its first
      interface, or, if it has been previously configured otherwise,
      with either another interface's hardware address, or another
      number to put in the hardware address field of the BOOTP packet.
      This is to allow routers without hardware addresses (like sync
      line only routers) to use BOOTP for bootload discovery.  TFTP can
      then be used to retrieve the image found in the BOOTP Reply.  If
      there are no configured interfaces or numbers to use, a router MAY
      cycle through the interface hardware addresses it has until a
      match is found by the BOOTP server.

	<a name="section-10.3.1"><h4>10.3.1   Introduction</h4></a>

      There is a range of possible models for performing O&M functions
      on a router.  At one extreme is the local-only model, under which
      the O&M functions can only be executed locally (e.g., from a
      terminal plugged into the router machine).  At the other extreme,
      the fully-remote model allows only an absolute minimum of
      functions to be performed locally (e.g., forcing a boot), with
      most O&M being done remotely from the NOC.  There are intermediate
      models, such as one in which NOC personnel can log into the router
      as a host, using the Telnet protocol, to perform functions which
      can also be invoked locally.  The local-only model may be adequate
      in a few router installations, but in general remote operation
      from a NOC will be required, and therefore remote O&M provisions
      are required for most routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Remote O&M functions may be exercised through a control agent
      (program).  In the direct approach, the router would support
      remote O&M functions directly from the NOC using standard Internet
      protocols (e.g., SNMP, UDP or TCP); in the indirect approach, the
      control agent would support these protocols and control the router
      itself using proprietary protocols.  The direct approach is
      preferred, although either approach is acceptable.  The use of
      specialized host hardware and/or software requiring significant
      additional investment is discouraged; nevertheless, some vendors
      may elect to provide the control agent as an integrated part of
      the network in which the routers are a part.  If this is the case,
      it is required that a means be available to operate the control
      agent from a remote site using Internet protocols and paths and
      with equivalent functionality with respect to a local agent
      terminal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      It is desirable that a control agent and any other NOC software
      tools which a vendor provides operate as user programs in a
      standard operating system.  The use of the standard Internet
      protocols UDP and TCP for communicating with the routers should
      facilitate this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Remote router monitoring and (especially) remote router control
      present important access control problems which must be addressed.
      Care must also be taken to ensure control of the use of router
      resources for these functions.  It is not desirable to let router
      monitoring take more than some limited fraction of the router CPU
      time, for example.  On the other hand, O&M functions must receive
      priority so they can be exercised when the router is congested,
      since often that is when O&M is most needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.3.2"><h4>10.3.2   Out Of Band Access</h4></a>

      Routers MUST support Out-Of-Band (OOB) access.  OOB access SHOULD
      provide the same functionality as in-band access.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         This Out-Of-Band access will allow the NOC a way to access
         isolated routers during times when network access is not
         available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Out-Of-Band access is an important management tool for the
         network administrator.  It allows the access of equipment
         independent of the network connections.  There are many ways to
         achieve this access.  Whichever one is used it is important
         that the access is independent of the network connections.  An
         example of Out-Of-Band access would be a serial port connected
         to a modem that provides dial up access to the router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         It is important that the OOB access provides the same
         functionality as in-band access.  In-band access, or accessing
         equipment through the existing network connection, is limiting,
         because most of the time, administrators need to reach
         equipment to figure out why it is unreachable.  In band access
         is still very important for configuring a router, and for
         troubleshooting more subtle problems.

         Each router SHOULD operate as a stand-alone device for the
         purposes of local hardware maintenance.  Means SHOULD be
         available to run diagnostic programs at the router site using
         only on-site tools.  A router SHOULD be able to run diagnostics
         in case of a fault.  For suggested hardware and software
         diagnostics see Section [10.3.3].
<a name="section-10.3.2.2"><h4>10.3.2.2   Control - Dumping and Rebooting</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1716.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

         A router MUST include both in-band and out-of-band mechanisms
         to allow the network manager to reload, stop, and restart the
         router.  A router SHOULD also contain a mechanism (such as a
         watchdog timer) which will reboot the router automatically if
         it hangs due to a software or hardware fault.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router SHOULD IMPLEMENT a mechanism for dumping the contents
         of a router's memory (and/or other state useful for vendor
         debugging after a crash), and either saving them on a stable
         storage device local to the router or saving them on another
         host via an up-line dump mechanism such as TFTP (see [OPER:2],
         [INTRO:3]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-10.3.2.3"><h4>10.3.2.3   Control - Configuring the Router</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1716.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

         Every router has configuration parameters which may need to be
         set.  It SHOULD be possible to update the parameters without
         rebooting the router; at worst, a restart MAY be required.
         There may be cases when it is not possible to change parameters
         without rebooting the router (for instance, changing the IP
         address of an interface).  In these cases, care should be taken
         to minimize disruption to the router and the surrounding
         network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         There SHOULD be a way to configure the router over the network
         either manually or automatically.  A router SHOULD be able to
         upload or download its parameters from a host or another
         router, and these parameters SHOULD be convertible into some
         sort of text format for making changes and then back to the
         form the router can read.  A router SHOULD have some sort of
         stable storage for its configuration. A router SHOULD NOT
         believe protocols such as RARP, ICMP Address Mask Reply, and
         MAY not believe BOOTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            It is necessary to note here that in the future RARP, ICMP
            Address Mask Reply, BOOTP and other mechanisms may be needed
            to allow a router to auto-configure.  Although routers may
            in the future be able to configure automatically, the intent
            here is to discourage this practice in a production
            environment until such time as auto-configuration has been
            tested more thoroughly. The intent is NOT to discourage
            auto-configuration all together.  In cases where a router is
            expected to get its configuration automatically it may be
            wise to allow the router to believe these things as it comes
            up and then ignore them after it has gotten its
            configuration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
<a name="section-10.3.2.4"><h4>10.3.2.4   Netbooting of System Software</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1716.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

         A router SHOULD keep its system image in local non-volatile
         storage such as PROM, NVRAM, or disk. It MAY also be able to
         load its system software over the network from a host or
         another router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router which can keep its system image in local non-volatile
         storage MAY be configurable to boot its system image over the
         network.  A router which offers this option SHOULD be
         configurable to boot the system image in its non-volatile local
         storage if it is unable to boot its system image over the
         network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            It is important that the router be able to come up and run
            on its own.  NVRAM may be a particular solution for routers
            used in large networks, since changing PROMs can be quite
            time consuming for a network manager responsible for
            numerous or geographically dispersed routers.  It is
            important to be able to netboot the system image because
            there should be an easy way for a router to get a bug fix or
            new feature more quickly than getting PROMS installed.  Also
            if the router has NVRAM instead of PROMs, it will netboot
            the image and then put it in NVRAM.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A router MAY also be able to distinguish between different
         configurations based on which software it is running. If
         configuration commands change from one software version to
         another, it would be helpful if the router could use the
         configuration that was compatible with the software.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-10.3.2.5"><h4>10.3.2.5   Detecting and responding to misconfiguration</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1716.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

         There MUST be mechanisms for detecting and responding to
         misconfigurations.  If a command is executed incorrectly, the
         router SHOULD give an error message.  The router SHOULD NOT
         accept a poorly formed command as if it were correct.
         DISCUSSION:
            There are cases where it is not possible to detect errors:
            the command is correctly formed, but incorrect with respect
            to the network.  This may be detected by the router, but may
            not be possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Another form of misconfiguration is misconfiguration of the
         network to which the router is attached.  A router MAY detect
         misconfigurations in the network.  The router MAY log these
         findings to a file, either on the router or a host, so that the
         network manager will see that there are possible problems on
         the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            Examples of such misconfigurations might be another router
            with the same address as the one in question or a router
            with the wrong subnet mask.  If a router detects such
            problems it is probably not the best idea for the router to
            try to fix the situation.  That could cause more harm than
            good.

<a name="section-10.3.2.6"><h4>10.3.2.6   Minimizing Disruption</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1716.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

         Changing the configuration of a router SHOULD have minimal
         affect on the network.   Routing tables SHOULD NOT be
         unnecessarily flushed when a simple change is made to the
         router.  If a router is running several routing protocols,
         stopping one routing protocol SHOULD NOT disrupt other routing
         protocols, except in the case where one network is learned by
         more than one routing protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DISCUSSION:
            It is the goal of a network manager to run a network so that
            users of the network get the best connectivity possible.
            Reloading a router for simple configuration changes can
            cause disruptions in routing and ultimately cause
            disruptions to the network and its users.  If routing tables
            are unnecessarily flushed, for instance, the default route
            will be lost as well as specific routes to sites within the
            network.  This sort of disruption will cause significant
            downtime for the users. It is the purpose of this section to
            point out that whenever possible, these disruptions should
            be avoided.

         (1)  A router MUST provide in-band network access, but (except<br>
              as required by Section [8.2]) for security considerations
              this access SHOULD be disabled by default.  Vendors MUST
              document the default state of any in-band access.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              DISCUSSION:
                 In-band access primarily refers to access via the
                 normal network protocols which may or may not affect
                 the permanent operational state of the router.  This
                 includes, but is not limited to Telnet/RLOGIN console
                 access and SNMP operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 This was a point of contention between the operational
                 out of the box and secure out of the box contingents.
                 Any automagic access to the router may introduce
                 insecurities, but it may be more important for the
                 customer to have a router which is accessible over the
                 network as soon as it is plugged in.  At least one
                 vendor supplies routers without any external console
                 access and depends on being able to access the router
                 via the network to complete its configuration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Basically, it is the vendors call whether or not in-
                 band access is enabled by default; but it is also the
                 vendors responsibility to make its customers aware of
                 possible insecurities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (2)  A router MUST provide the ability to initiate an ICMP<br>
              echo.  The following options SHOULD be implemented:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  Choice of data patterns

              o  Choice of packet size

              o  Record route

              and the following additional options MAY be implemented:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              o  Loose source route

              o  Strict source route

              o  Timestamps
         (3)  A router SHOULD provide the ability to initiate a<br>
              traceroute.  If traceroute is provided, then the 3rd party
              traceroute SHOULD be implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Each of the above three facilities (if implemented) SHOULD have
         access restrictions placed on it to prevent its abuse by
         unauthorized persons.

	<a name="section-10.4.1"><h4>10.4.1   Auditing and Audit Trails</h4></a>

      Auditing and billing are the bane of the network operator, but are
      the two features most requested by those in charge of network
      security and those who are responsible for paying the bills.  In
      the context of security, auditing is desirable if it helps you
      keep your network working and protects your resources from abuse,
      without costing you more than those resources are worth.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  Configuration Changes<br>

           Router SHOULD provide a method for auditing a configuration
           change of a router, even if it's something as simple as
           recording the operator's initials and time of change.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           DISCUSSION:
              Having the ability to track who made changes and when is
              highly desirable, especially if your packets suddenly
              start getting routed through Alaska on their way across
              town.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  Packet Accounting<br>

           Vendors should strongly consider providing a system for
           tracking traffic levels between pairs of hosts or networks.
           A mechanism for limiting the collection of this information
           to specific pairs of hosts or networks is also strongly
           encouraged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           DISCUSSION:
              A host traffic matrix as described above can give the
              network operator a glimpse of traffic trends not apparent
              from other statistics.  It can also identify hosts or
              networks which are probing the structure of the attached
              networks - e.g., a single external host which tries to
              send packets to every IP address in the network address
              range for a connected network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (3)  Security Auditing<br>

           Routers MUST provide a method for auditing security related
           failures or violations to include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           o  Authorization Failures:  bad passwords, invalid SNMP
              communities, invalid authorization tokens,

           o  Violations of Policy Controls:  Prohibited Source Routes,
              Filtered Destinations, and

           o  Authorization Approvals:  good passwords - Telnet in-band
              access, console access.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Routers MUST provide a method of limiting or disabling such
           auditing but auditing SHOULD be on by default.  Possible
           methods for auditing include listing violations to a console
           if present, logging or counting them internally, or logging
           them to a remote security server via the SNMP trap mechanism
           or the Unix logging mechanism as appropriate.  A router MUST
           implement at least one of these reporting mechanisms - it MAY
           implement more than one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.4.2"><h4>10.4.2   Configuration Control</h4></a>

      A vendor has a responsibility to use good configuration control
      practices in the creation of the software/firmware loads for their
      routers.  In particular, if a vendor makes updates and loads
      available for retrieval over the Internet, the vendor should also
      provide a way for the customer to confirm the load is a valid one,
      perhaps by the verification of a checksum over the load.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         Many vendors currently provide short notice updates of their
         software products via the Internet.  This a good trend and
         should be encouraged, but provides a point of vulnerability in
         the configuration control process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If a vendor provides the ability for the customer to change the
      configuration parameters of a router remotely, for example via a
      Telnet session, the ability to do so SHOULD be configurable and
      SHOULD default to off.  The router SHOULD require a password or
      other valid authentication before permitting remote
      reconfiguration.
      DISCUSSION:
         Allowing your properly identified network operator to twiddle
         with your routers is necessary; allowing anyone else to do so
         is foolhardy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A router MUST NOT have undocumented back door access and master
      passwords.  A vendor MUST ensure any such access added for
      purposes of debugging or product development are deleted before
      the product is distributed to its customers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DISCUSSION:
         A vendor has a responsibility to its customers to ensure they
         are aware of the vulnerabilities present in its code by
         intention - e.g.  in-band access.  Trap doors, back doors and
         master passwords intentional or unintentional can turn a
         relatively secure router into a major problem on an operational
         network.  The supposed operational benefits are not matched by
         the potential problems.

APPENDIX  A. REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE-ROUTING HOSTS

Subject to restrictions given below, a host MAY be able to act as an
intermediate hop in a source route, forwarding a source-routed datagram
to the next specified hop.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">However, in performing this router-like function, the host MUST obey all
the relevant rules for a router forwarding source-routed datagrams
[INTRO:2].  This includes the following specific provisions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(A)  TTL
     The TTL field MUST be decremented and the datagram perhaps
     discarded as specified for a router in [INTRO:2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(B)  ICMP Destination Unreachable
     A host MUST be able to generate Destination Unreachable messages
     with the following codes:
     4 (Fragmentation Required but DF Set) when a source-routed datagram
       cannot be fragmented to fit into the target network;
     5 (Source Route Failed) when a source-routed datagram cannot be
       forwarded, e.g., because of a routing problem or because the next
       hop of a strict source route is not on a connected network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(C)  IP Source Address
     A source-routed datagram being forwarded MAY (and normally will)
     have a source address that is not one of the IP addresses of the
     forwarding host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(D)  Record Route Option
     A host that is forwarding a source-routed datagram containing a
     Record Route option MUST update that option, if it has room.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(E)  Timestamp Option
     A host that is forwarding a source-routed datagram containing a
     Timestamp Option MUST add the current timestamp to that option,
     according to the rules for this option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">To define the rules restricting host forwarding of source-routed
datagrams, we use the term local source-routing if the next hop will be
through the same physical interface through which the datagram arrived;
otherwise, it is non-local source-routing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A host is permitted to perform local source-routing without restriction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A host that supports non-local source-routing MUST have a configurable
switch to disable forwarding, and this switch MUST default to disabled.
The host MUST satisfy all router requirements for configurable policy
filters [INTRO:2] restricting non-local forwarding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">If a host receives a datagram with an incomplete source route but does
not forward it for some reason, the host SHOULD return an ICMP
Destination Unreachable (code 5, Source Route Failed) message, unless
the datagram was itself an ICMP error message.
APPENDIX  B. GLOSSARY


This Appendix defines specific terms used in this memo.  It also defines
some general purpose terms that may be of interest.  See also [INTRO:9]
for a more general set of definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">AS
     Autonomous System A collection of routers under a single
     administrative authority using a common Interior Gateway Protocol
     for routing packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Connected Network
     A network to which a router is interfaced is often known as the
     local network or the subnetwork relative to that router. However,
     these terms can cause confusion, and therefore we use the term
     Connected Network in this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Connected (Sub)Network
     A Connected (Sub)Network is an IP subnetwork to which a router is
     interfaced, or a connected network if the connected network is not
     subnetted.  See also Connected Network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Datagram
     The unit transmitted between a pair of internet modules.  data,
     called datagrams, from sources to destinations.  The Internet
     Protocol does not provide a reliable communication facility.  There
     are no acknowledgments either end-to-end or hop-by-hop.  There is
     no error no retransmissions.  There is no flow control.  See IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Default Route
     A routing table entry which is used to direct any data addressed to
     any network numbers not explicitly listed in the routing table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">EGP
     Exterior Gateway Protocol A protocol which distributes routing
     information to the gateways (routers) which connect autonomous
     systems.  See IGP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">EGP-2
     Exterior Gateway Protocol version 2 This is an EGP routing protocol
     developed to handle traffic between AS's in the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Forwarder
     The logical entity within a router that is responsible for
     switching packets among the router's interfaces.  The Forwarder
     also makes the decisions to queue a packet for local delivery, to
     queue a packet for transmission out another interface, or both.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Forwarding
     Forwarding is the process a router goes through for each packet
     received by the router.  The packet may be consumed by the router,
     it may be output on one or more interfaces of the router, or both.
     Forwarding includes the process of deciding what to do with the
     packet as well as queuing it up for (possible) output or internal
     consumption.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Fragment
     An IP datagram which represents a portion of a higher layer's
     packet which was too large to be sent in its entirety over the
     output network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">IGP
     Interior Gateway Protocol A protocol which distributes routing
     information with an Autonomous System (AS).  See EGP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Interface IP Address
     The IP Address and subnet mask that is assigned to a specific
     interface of a router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Internet Address
     An assigned number which identifies a host in an internet.  It has
     two or three parts: network number, optional subnet number, and
     host number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">IP
     Internet Protocol The network layer protocol for the Internet.  It
     is a packet switching, datagram protocol defined in RFC 791.  IP
     does not provide a reliable communications facility; that is, there
     are no end-to-end of hop-by-hop acknowledgments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">IP Datagram
     An IP Datagram is the unit of end-to-end transmission in the
     Internet Protocol.  An IP Datagram consists of an IP header
     followed by all of higher-layer data (such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and
     the like).  An IP Datagram is an IP header followed by a message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     An IP Datagram is a complete IP end-to-end transmission unit.  An
     IP Datagram is composed of one or more IP Fragments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     In this memo, the unqualified term Datagram should be understood to
     refer to an IP Datagram.
IP Fragment
     An IP Fragment is a component of an IP Datagram.  An IP Fragment
     consists of an IP header followed by all or part of the higher-
     layer of the original IP Datagram.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     One or more IP Fragments comprises a single IP Datagram.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     In this memo, the unqualified term Fragment should be understood to
     refer to an IP Fragment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">IP Packet
     An IP Datagram or an IP Fragment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     In this memo, the unqualified term Packet should generally be
     understood to refer to an IP Packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Logical [network] interface
     We define a logical [network] interface to be a logical path,
     distinguished by a unique IP address, to a connected network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Martian Filtering
     A packet which contains an invalid source or destination address is
     considered to be martian and discarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
     The size of the largest packet that can be transmitted or received
     through a logical interface.  This size includes the IP header but
     does not include the size of any Link Layer headers or framing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Multicast
     A packet which is destined for multiple hosts.  See broadcast.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Multicast Address
     A special type of address which is recognized by multiple hosts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     A Multicast Address is sometimes known as a Functional Address or a
     Group Address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Originate
     Packets can be transmitted by a router for one of two reasons: 1)
     the packet was received and is being forwarded or 2) the router
     itself created the packet for transmission (such as route
     advertisements).  Packets that the router creates for transmission
     are said to originate at the router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Packet
     A packet is the unit of data passed across the interface between
     the Internet Layer and the Link Layer.  It includes an IP header
     and data.  A packet may be a complete IP datagram or a fragment of
     an IP datagram.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Path
     The sequence of routers and (sub-)networks which a packet traverses
     from a particular router to a particular destination host.  Note
     that a path is uni-directional; it is not unusual to have different
     paths in the two directions between a given host pair.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Physical Network
     A Physical Network is a network (or a piece of an internet) which
     is contiguous at the Link Layer.  Its internal structure (if any)
     is transparent to the Internet Layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     In this memo, several media components that are connected together
     via devices such as bridges or repeaters are considered to be a
     single Physical Network since such devices are transparent to the
     IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Physical Network Interface
     This is a physical interface to a Connected Network and has a
     (possibly unique) Link-Layer address.  Multiple Physical Network
     Interfaces on a single router may share the same Link-Layer
     address, but the address must be unique for different routers on
     the same Physical Network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">router
     A special-purpose dedicated computer that attaches several networks
     together.  Routers switch packets between these networks in a
     process known as forwarding.  This process may be repeated several

APPENDIX D.  Multicast Routing Protocols

Multicasting is a relatively new technology within the Internet Protocol
family.  It is not widely deployed or commonly in use yet.  Its
importance, however, is expected to grow over the coming years.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This Appendix describes some of the technologies being investigated for
routing multicasts through the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A diligent implementor will keep abreast of developments in this area in
order to properly develop multicast facilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This Appendix does not specify any standards or requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">D.1  Introduction

   Multicast routing protocols enable the forwarding of IP multicast
   datagrams throughout a TCP/IP internet. Generally these algorithms
   forward the datagram based on its source and destination addresses.
   Additionally, the datagram may need to be forwarded to several
   multicast group members, at times requiring the datagram to be
   replicated and sent out multiple interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The state of multicast routing protocols is less developed than the
   protocols available for the forwarding of IP unicasts.  Two multicast
   routing protocols have been documented for TCP/IP; both are currently
   considered to be experimental.  Both also use the IGMP protocol
   (discussed in Section [4.4]) to monitor multicast group membership.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">D.2  Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol - DVMRP

   DVMRP, documented in [ROUTE:9], is based on Distance Vector or
   Bellman-Ford technology. It routes multicast datagrams only, and does
   so within a single Autonomous System. DVMRP is an implementation of
   the Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting algorithm described in
   [ROUTE:10].  In addition, it specifies the tunneling of IP multicasts
   through non-multicast-routing-capable IP domains.
D.3  Multicast Extensions to OSPF - MOSPF

   MOSPF, currently under development, is a backward-compatible addition
   to OSPF that allows the forwarding of both IP multicasts and unicasts
   within an Autonomous System. MOSPF routers can be mixed with OSPF
   routers within a routing domain, and they will interoperate in the
   forwarding of unicasts. OSPF is a link-state or SPF-based protocol.
   By adding link state advertisements that pinpoint group membership,
   MOSPF routers can calculate the path of a multicast datagram as a
   tree rooted at the datagram source. Those branches that do not
   contain group members can then be discarded, eliminating unnecessary
   datagram forwarding hops.
APPENDIX E  Additional Next-Hop Selection Algorithms

Section [5.2.4.3] specifies an algorithm that routers ought to use when
selecting a next-hop for a packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This appendix provides historical perspective for the next-hop selection
problem.  It also presents several additional pruning rules and next-hop
selection algorithms that might be found in the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This appendix presents material drawn from an earlier, unpublished, work
by Philip Almquist; Ruminations on the Next Hop.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This Appendix does not specify any standards or requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">E.1. Some Historical Perspective

   It is useful to briefly review the history of the topic, beginning
   with what is sometimes called the "classic model" of how a router
   makes routing decisions.  This model predates IP.  In this model, a
   router speaks some single routing protocol such as RIP.  The protocol
   completely determines the contents of the router's FIB.  The route
   lookup algorithm is trivial: the router looks in the FIB for a route
   whose destination attribute exactly matches the network number
   portion of the destination address in the packet.  If one is found,
   it is used; if none is found, the destination is unreachable.
   Because the routing protocol keeps at most one route to each
   destination, the problem of what to do when there are multiple routes
   which match the same destination cannot arise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Over the years, this classic model has been augmented in small ways.
   With the advent of default routes, subnets, and host routes, it
   became possible to have more than one routing table entry which in
   some sense matched the destination.  This was easily resolved by a
   consensus that there was a hierarchy of routes: host routes should be
   preferred over subnet routes, subnet routes over net routes, and net
   routes over default routes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With the advent of variable length subnet masks, the general approach
   remained the same although its description became a little more
   complicated. We now say that each route has a bit mask associated
   with it.  If a particular bit in a route's bit mask is set, the
   corresponding bit in the route's destination attribute is
   significant. A route cannot be used to route a packet unless each
   significant bit in the route's destination attribute matches the
   corresponding bit in the packet's destination address, and routes
   with more bits set in their masks are preferred over routes which
   have fewer bits set in their masks. This is simply a generalization
   of the hierarchy of routes described above, and will be referred to
   for the rest of this memo as choosing a route by preferring longest
   match.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Another way the classic model has been augmented is through a small
   amount of relaxation of the notion that a routing protocol has
   complete control over the contents of the routing table.  First,
   static routes were introduced.  For the first time, it was possible
   to simultaneously have two routes (one dynamic and one static) to the
   same destination.  When this happened, a router had to have a policy
   (in some cases configurable, and in other cases chosen by the author
   of the router's software) which determined whether the static route
   or the dynamic route was preferred. However, this policy was only
   used as a tie-breaker when longest match didn't uniquely determine
   which route to use. Thus, for example, a static default route would
   never be preferred over a dynamic net route even if the policy
   preferred static routes over dynamic routes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The classic model had to be further augmented when inter-domain
   routing protocols were invented. Traditional routing protocols came
   to be called "interior gateway protocols" (IGPs), and at each
   Internet site there was a strange new beast called an "exterior
   gateway", a router which spoke EGP to several "BBN Core Gateways"
   (the routers which made up the Internet backbone at the time) at the
   same time as it spoke its IGP to the other routers at its site. Both
   protocols wanted to determine the contents of the router's routing
   table. Theoretically, this could result in a router having three
   routes (EGP, IGP, and static) to the same destination.  Because of
   the Internet topology at the time, it was resolved with little debate
   that routers would be best served by a policy of preferring IGP
   routes over EGP routes.  However, the sanctity of longest match
   remained unquestioned: a default route learned from the IGP would
   never be preferred over a net route from learned EGP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although the Internet topology, and consequently routing in the
   Internet, have evolved considerably since then, this slightly
   augmented version of the classic model has survived pretty much
   intact to this day in the Internet (except that BGP has replaced
   EGP).  Conceptually (and often in implementation) each router has a
   routing table and one or more routing protocol processes.  Each of
   these processes can add any entry that it pleases, and can delete or
   modify any entry that it has created. When routing a packet, the
   router picks the best route using longest match, augmented with a
   policy mechanism to break ties. Although this augmented classic model
   has served us well, it has a number of shortcomings:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It ignores (although it could be augmented to consider) path
      characteristics such as quality of service and MTU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It doesn't support routing protocols (such as OSPF and Integrated
      IS-IS) that require route lookup algorithms different than pure
      longest match.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  There has not been a firm consensus on what the tie-breaking
      mechanism ought to be. Tie-breaking mechanisms have often been
      found to be difficult if not impossible to configure in such a way
      that the router will always pick what the network manger considers
      to be the "correct" route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">E.2. Additional Pruning Rules

   Section [5.2.4.3] defined several pruning rules to use to select
   routes from the FIB.  There are other rules that could also be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  OSPF Route Class
      Routing protocols which have areas or make a distinction between
      internal and external routes divide their routes into classes,
      where classes are rank-ordered in terms of preference. A route is
      always chosen from the most preferred class unless none is
      available, in which case one is chosen from the second most
      preferred class, and so on. In OSPF, the classes (in order from
      most preferred to least preferred) are intra-area, inter-area,
      type 1 external (external routes with internal metrics), and type
      2 external. As an additional wrinkle, a router is configured to
      know what addresses ought to be accessible via intra-area routes,
      and will not use inter- area or external routes to reach these
      destinations even when no intra-area route is available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      More precisely, we assume that each route has a class attribute,
      called route.class, which is assigned by the routing protocol.
      The set of candidate routes is examined to determine if it
      contains any for which route.class = intra-area.  If so, all
      routes except those for which route.class = intra-area are
      discarded.  Otherwise, router checks whether the packet's
      destination falls within the address ranges configured for the
      local area.  If so, the entire set of candidate routes is deleted.
      Otherwise, the set of candidate routes is examined to determine if
      it contains any for which route.class = inter-area.  If so, all
      routes except those for which route.class = inter-area are
      discarded.  Otherwise, the set of candidate routes is examined to
      determine if it contains any for which route.class = type 1
      external.  If so, all routes except those for which route.class =
      type 1 external are discarded.
   o  IS-IS Route Class
      IS-IS route classes work identically to OSPF's. However, the set
      of classes defined by Integrated IS-IS is different, such that
      there isn't a one-to-one mapping between IS-IS route classes and
      OSPF route classes. The route classes used by Integrated IS-IS are
      (in order from most preferred to least preferred) intra-area,
      inter-area, and external.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Integrated IS-IS internal class is equivalent to the OSPF
      internal class. Likewise, the Integrated IS-IS external class is
      equivalent to OSPF's type 2 external class. However, Integrated
      IS-IS does not make a distinction between inter-area routes and
      external routes with internal metrics - both are considered to be
      inter-area routes. Thus, OSPF prefers true inter-area routes over
      external routes with internal metrics, whereas Integrated IS-IS
      gives the two types of routes equal preference.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  IDPR Policy
      A specific case of Policy. The IETF's Inter-domain Policy Routing
      Working Group is devising a routing protocol called Inter-Domain
      Policy Routing (IDPR) to support true policy-based routing in the
      Internet. Packets with certain combinations of header attributes
      (such as specific combinations of source and destination addresses
      or special IDPR source route options) are required to use routes
      provided by the IDPR protocol. Thus, unlike other Policy pruning
      rules, IDPR Policy would have to be applied before any other
      pruning rules except Basic Match.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Specifically, IDPR Policy examines the packet being forwarded to
      ascertain if its attributes require that it be forwarded using
      policy-based routes. If so, IDPR Policy deletes all routes not
      provided by the IDPR protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">E.3  Some Route Lookup Algorithms

   This section examines several route lookup algorithms that are in use
   or have been proposed.  Each is described by giving the sequence of
   pruning rules it uses.  The strengths and weaknesses of each
   algorithm are presented
E.3.1 The Revised Classic Algorithm

      The Revised Classic Algorithm is the form of the traditional
      algorithm which was discussed in Section [E.1].  The steps of this
      algorithm are:
      1.  Basic match
      2.  Longest match
      3.  Best metric
      4.  Policy

      Some implementations omit the Policy step, since it is needed only
      when routes may have metrics that are not comparable (because they
      were learned from different routing domains).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The advantages of this algorithm are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  It is widely implemented.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  Except for the Policy step (which an implementor can choose<br>
           to make arbitrarily complex) the algorithm is simple both to
           understand and to implement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Its disadvantages are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  It does not handle IS-IS or OSPF route classes, and therefore<br>
           cannot be used for Integrated IS-IS or OSPF.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  It does not handle TOS or other path attributes.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (3)  The policy mechanisms are not standardized in any way, and<br>
           are therefore are often implementation-specific.  This causes
           extra work for implementors (who must invent appropriate
           policy mechanisms) and for users (who must learn how to use
           the mechanisms.  This lack of a standardized mechanism also
           makes it difficult to build consistent configurations for
           routers from different vendors.  This presents a significant
           practical deterrent to multi-vendor interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (4)  The proprietary policy mechanisms currently provided by<br>
           vendors are often inadequate in complex parts of the
           Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (5)  The algorithm has not been written down in any generally<br>
           available document or standard.  It is, in effect, a part of
           the Internet Folklore.
E.3.2 The Variant Router Requirements Algorithm

      Some Router Requirements Working Group members have proposed a
      slight variant of the algorithm described in the Section
      [5.2.4.3].  In this variant, matching the type of service
      requested is considered to be more important, rather than less
      important, than matching as much of the destination address as
      possible.  For example, this algorithm would prefer a default
      route which had the correct type of service over a network route
      which had the default type of service, whereas the algorithm in
      [5.2.4.3] would make the opposite choice.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The steps of the algorithm are:
      1.  Basic match
      2.  Weak TOS
      3.  Longest match
      4.  Best metric
      5.  Policy

      Debate between the proponents of this algorithm and the regular
      Router Requirements Algorithm suggests that each side can show
      cases where its algorithm leads to simpler, more intuitive routing
      than the other's algorithm does.  In general, this variant has the
      same set of advantages and disadvantages that the algorithm
      specified in [5.2.4.3] does, except that pruning on Weak TOS
      before pruning on Longest Match makes this algorithm less
      compatible with OSPF and Integrated IS-IS than the standard Router
      Requirements Algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">E.3.3 The OSPF Algorithm

      OSPF uses an algorithm which is virtually identical to the Router
      Requirements Algorithm except for one crucial difference: OSPF
      considers OSPF route classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The algorithm is:
      1.  Basic match
      2.  OSPF route class
      3.  Longest match
      4.  Weak TOS
      5.  Best metric
      6.  Policy

      Type of service support is not always present.  If it is not
      present then, of course, the fourth step would be omitted

      This algorithm has some advantages over the Revised Classic
      Algorithm:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  It supports type of service routing.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  Its rules are written down, rather than merely being a part<br>
           of the Internet folklore.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (3)  It (obviously) works with OSPF.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      However, this algorithm also retains some of the disadvantages of
      the Revised Classic Algorithm:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  Path properties other than type of service (e.g. MTU) are<br>
           ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  As in the Revised Classic Algorithm, the details (or even the<br>
           existence) of the Policy step are left to the discretion of
           the implementor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The OSPF Algorithm also has a further disadvantage (which is not
      shared by the Revised Classic Algorithm).  OSPF internal (intra-
      area or inter-area) routes are always considered to be superior to
      routes learned from other routing protocols, even in cases where
      the OSPF route matches fewer bits of the destination address.
      This is a policy decision that is inappropriate in some networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Finally, it is worth noting that the OSPF Algorithm's TOS support
      suffers from a deficiency in that routing protocols which support
      TOS are implicitly preferred when forwarding packets which have
      non-zero TOS values.  This may not be appropriate in some cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">E.3.4 The Integrated IS-IS Algorithm

      Integrated IS-IS uses an algorithm which is similar to but not
      quite identical to the OSPF Algorithm.  Integrated IS-IS uses a
      different set of route classes, and also differs slightly in its
      handling of type of service.  The algorithm is:
      1. Basic Match
      2. IS-IS Route Classes
      3. Longest Match
      4. Weak TOS
      5. Best Metric
      6. Policy

      Although Integrated IS-IS uses Weak TOS, the protocol is only
      capable of carrying routes for a small specific subset of the
      possible values for the TOS field in the IP header.  Packets
      containing other values in the TOS field are routed using the
      default TOS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type of service support is optional; if disabled, the fourth step
      would be omitted.  As in OSPF, the specification does not include
      the Policy step.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This algorithm has some advantages over the Revised Classic
      Algorithm:
      (1)  It supports type of service routing.<br>
      (2)  Its rules are written down, rather than merely being a part<br>
           of the Internet folklore.
      (3)  It (obviously) works with Integrated IS-IS.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      However, this algorithm also retains some of the disadvantages of
      the Revised Classic Algorithm:
      (1)  Path properties other than type of service (e.g. MTU) are<br>
           ignored.
      (2)  As in the Revised Classic Algorithm, the details (or even the<br>
           existence) of the Policy step are left to the discretion of
           the implementor.
      (3)  It doesn't work with OSPF because of the differences between<br>
           IS-IS route classes and OSPF route classes.  Also, because
           IS-IS supports only a subset of the possible TOS values, some
           obvious implementations of the Integrated IS-IS algorithm
           would not support OSPF's interpretation of TOS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Integrated IS-IS Algorithm also has a further disadvantage
      (which is not shared by the Revised Classic Algorithm): IS-IS
      internal (intra-area or inter-area) routes are always considered
      to be superior to routes learned from other routing protocols,
      even in cases where the IS-IS route matches fewer bits of the
      destination address and doesn't provide the requested type of
      service.  This is a policy decision that may not be appropriate in
      all cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Finally, it is worth noting that the Integrated IS-IS Algorithm's
      TOS support suffers from the same deficiency noted for the OSPF
      Algorithm.
Security Considerations

Although the focus of this document is interoperability rather than
security, there are obviously many sections of this document which have
some ramifications on network security.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Security means different things to different people.  Security from a
router's point of view is anything that helps to keep its own networks
operational and in addition helps to keep the Internet as a whole
healthy.  For the purposes of this document, the security services we
are concerned with are denial of service, integrity, and authentication
as it applies to the first two.  Privacy as a security service is
important, but only peripherally a concern of a router - at least as of
the date of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">In several places in this document there are sections entitled ...
Security Considerations. These sections discuss specific considerations
that apply to the general topic under discussion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Rarely does this document say do this and your router/network will be
secure.  More likely, it says this is a good idea and if you do it, it
*may* improve the security of the Internet and your local system in
general.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Unfortunately, this is the state-of-the-art AT THIS TIME.  Few if any of
the network protocols a router is concerned with have reasonable,
built-in security features.  Industry and the protocol designers have
been and are continuing to struggle with these issues.  There is
progress, but only small baby steps such as the peer-to-peer
authentication available in the BGP and OSPF routing protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">In particular, this document notes the current research into developing
and enhancing network security.  Specific areas of research,
development, and engineering that are underway as of this writing
(December 1993) are in IP Security, SNMP Security, and common
authentication technologies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Notwithstanding all of the above, there are things both vendors and
users can do to improve the security of their router.  Vendors should
get a copy of Trusted Computer System Interpretation [INTRO:8].  Even if
a vendor decides not to submit their device for formal verification
under these guidelines, the publication provides excellent guidance on
general security design and practices for computing devices.
Acknowledgments


O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work to-day!

What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more, methinks, would share from me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man's company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
But he'll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember'd;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This memo is a product of the IETF's Router Requirements Working Group.
A memo such as this one is of necessity the work of many more people
than could be listed here.  A wide variety of vendors, network managers,
and other experts from the Internet community graciously contributed
their time and wisdom to improve the quality of this memo.  The editor
wishes to extend sincere thanks to all of them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The current editor also wishes to single out and extend his heartfelt
gratitude and appreciation to the original editor of this document;
Philip Almquist.  Without Philip's work, both as the original editor and
as the Chair of the working group, this document would not have been
produced.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Philip Almquist, Jeffrey Burgan, Frank Kastenholz, and Cathy Wittbrodt
each wrote major chapters of this memo.  Others who made major
contributions to the document included Bill Barns, Steve Deering, Kent
England, Jim Forster, Martin Gross, Jeff Honig, Steve Knowles, Yoni
Malachi, Michael Reilly, and Walt Wimer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Additional text came from Art Berggreen, John Cavanaugh, Ross Callon,
John Lekashman, Brian Lloyd, Gary Malkin, Milo Medin, John Moy, Craig
Partridge, Stephanie Price, Yakov Rekhter, Steve Senum, Richard Smith,
Frank Solensky, Rich Woundy, and others who have been inadvertently
overlooked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Some of the text in this memo has been (shamelessly) plagiarized from
earlier documents, most notably RFC-1122 by Bob Braden and the Host
Requirements Working Group, and RFC-1009 by Bob Braden and Jon Postel.
The work of these earlier authors is gratefully acknowledged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Jim Forster was a co-chair of the Router Requirements Working Group
during its early meetings, and was instrumental in getting the group off
to a good start.  Jon Postel, Bob Braden, and Walt Prue also contributed
to the success by providing a wealth of good advice prior to the group's
first meeting.  Later on, Phill Gross, Vint Cerf, and Noel Chiappa all
provided valuable advice and support.
Mike St. Johns coordinated the Working Group's interactions with the
security community, and Frank Kastenholz coordinated the Working Group's
interactions with the network management area.  Allison Mankin and K.K.
Ramakrishnan provided expertise on the issues of congestion control and
resource allocation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Many more people than could possibly be listed or credited here
participated in the deliberations of the Router Requirements Working
Group, either through electronic mail or by attending meetings.
However, the efforts of Ross Callon and Vince Fuller in sorting out the
difficult issues of route choice and route leaking are especially
acknowledged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The previous editor, Philip Almquist, wishes to extend his thanks and
appreciation to his former employers, Stanford University and BARRNet,
for allowing him to spend a large fraction (probably far more than they
ever imagined when he started on this) of his time working on this
project.

</p>The current editor wishes to thank his employer, FTP Software, for
allowing him to spend the time necessary to finish this document.
