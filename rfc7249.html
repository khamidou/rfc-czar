	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   In accordance with the IETF-IANA Memorandum of Understanding
   [RFC2860], RFC 7020 [RFC7020] provides information about the Internet
   Numbers Registry System and how it is used in the distribution of
   autonomous system (AS) numbers and globally unique unicast Internet
   Protocol (IP) address space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This companion document identifies the IANA registries that are part
   of the Internet Numbers Registry System at this time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Internet Numbers Registries</h2></a>

   Three IANA registries are associated with the Internet Numbers
   Registry System: "Autonomous System (AS) Numbers", "IANA IPv4 Address
   Space Registry", and "IPv6 Global Unicast Address Assignments".
   However, in each case, there are special-purpose values, and those
   special-purpose values are outside the Internet Numbers Registry
   System.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Autonomous System Numbers</h3></a>

   For historical reasons, there are 16-bit AS numbers and 32-bit AS
   numbers.  However, the 16-bit AS numbers are really just zero through
   65535 of the 32-bit AS number space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The allocation and registration functions for all non-reserved AS
   numbers are handled by the Internet Numbers Registry System in
   accordance with policies developed by the Regional Internet
   Registries (RIRs) in accordance with their processes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some special-purpose AS numbers have been reserved.  Section 3 of
   this document establishes an IANA registry for special-purpose AS
   Numbers that have already been reserved.  Future additions to this
   registry can be made through "IETF Review" as defined in [RFC5226].
   Once a reservation is approved, it is recorded in the special-purpose
   AS numbers registry with a reference to the IESG-approved RFC that
   documents the reservation.
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   IPv4 Addresses</h3></a>

   The allocation and registration functions for all non-reserved,
   globally unique unicast IPv4 addresses are handled by the Internet
   Numbers Registry System in accordance with policies developed by the
   RIRs in accordance with their processes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reservations of special-purpose IPv4 addresses can be found in the
   IANA registry [IANA-IPv4-Reg].  Future additions to this registry can
   be made through "IETF Review" as defined in [RFC5226].  Once a
   reservation is approved, it is recorded in the special-purpose IPv4
   address registry with a reference to the IESG-approved RFC that
   documents the reservation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   IPv6 Addresses</h3></a>

   The vast bulk of the IPv6 address space (approximately 7/8ths of the
   whole address space) is reserved by the IETF [RFC4291], with the
   expectation that further assignment of globally unique unicast
   address space will be made from this reserved space in accordance
   with future needs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The allocation and registration functions for all non-reserved
   globally unique unicast IPv6 addresses are handled by the Internet
   Numbers Registry System in accordance with policies developed by the
   RIRs in accordance with their processes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reservations of special-purpose IPv6 addresses can be found in the
   IANA registry [IANA-IPv6-Reg].  Future additions to this registry can
   be made through "IETF Review" as defined in [RFC5226].  Once a
   reservation is approved, it is recorded in the special-purpose IPv6
   address registry with a reference to the IESG-approved RFC that
   documents the reservation.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has created the "Special-Purpose AS Numbers" registry.  Future
   additions to this registry can be made through "IETF Review" as
   defined in [RFC5226].  At this time, the special-purpose AS numbers
   are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AS Numbers             Reason for Reservation
   ---------------------  -------------------------------------------
   0                      Reserved by [AS0-PROCESS]
   23456                  AS_TRANS; reserved by [RFC6793]
   64496-64511            For documentation and sample code; reserved
                            by [RFC5398]
   64512-65534            For private use; reserved by [RFC6996]
   65535                  Reserved by [RFC1930]
   65536-65551            For documentation and sample code; reserved
                            by [RFC5398]
   4200000000-4294967294  For private use; reserved by [RFC6996]
   4294967295             Reserved by [LAST-AS-RES]

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document identifies the IANA registries that are part of the
   Internet Numbers Registry System at the time of publication.  It does
   not change the security posture of the Internet in any way.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Network operators should take care that special-purpose numbers and
   addresses are used on the public Internet in a manner that is
   consistent with their reserved purpose.
