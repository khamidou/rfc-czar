                     Information Management System
                     -----------------------------

        We intend to build an Information Management and Statistical System
   for the ILLIAC IV.  It is intended to support various areas of research
   whose problems are ILLIAC IV suited and whose data bases are large.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        This System will include a user language and necessary manipulatory
   routines for the ILLIAC IV.  It will use the datacomputer for Archival
   storage and provide the interface to the datacomputer for queries not
   ILLIAC suited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        If you have problems involving large amounts of data and wish to
   learn more about our proposed system or contribute to its development,
   contact:
