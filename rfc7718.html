     Registries for the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo describes the registries for OWAMP -- the One-Way Active
   Measurement Protocol.  The registries allow assignment of Mode bit
   positions and OWAMP Command numbers.  Per this memo, IANA has
   established the registries for new features, called the OWAMP-Modes
   registry and the OWAMP Control Command Number registry.  This memo
   updates RFC 4656.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656] was
   prepared to support measurements of metrics specified by the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group in the IETF.  The Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] is an extension of
   OWAMP.  The TWAMP specification gathered wide review as it approached
   completion, and the by-products were several recommendations for new
   features in TWAMP.  As a result, a registry of new features was
   established for TWAMP.  However, there were no new features proposed
   for OWAMP until recently [RFC7717].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo establishes the needed registries for OWAMP and updates
   [RFC4656].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Language</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Purpose and Scope</h2></a>

   The purpose and scope of this memo is to describe and request the
   establishment of registries for future OWAMP [RFC4656] extensions.
   IANA already administers the "Two-way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP) Parameters", and this request follows a similar form (with
   one exception identified below).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo also provides the initial contents for the OWAMP
   registries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations for OWAMP-Control Registries</h2></a>

   The OWAMP-Control protocol coordinates the measurement capability.
   All OWAMP-Control messages follow specifications defined in Section 3
   of [RFC4656].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Control Command Number Registry</h3></a>

   IANA has created an OWAMP-Control Command Number registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OWAMP-Control Commands follow specifications defined in Section 3.4
   of [RFC4656].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.1"><h4>3.1.1   Registry Specification</h4></a>

   OWAMP-Control Command Numbers are specified in the first octet of
   OWAMP-Control-Client command messages consistent with Section 3 of
   [RFC4656].  There are a maximum of 256 command numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.2"><h4>3.1.2   Registry Management</h4></a>

   Because the "OWAMP-Control Command Numbers" registry can contain only
   256 values, and because OWAMP is an IETF protocol, these registries
   MUST be updated only by "IETF Review" as specified in [RFC5226] (an
   RFC that documents registry use and is approved by the IESG).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.3"><h4>3.1.3   Experimental Numbers</h4></a>

   One experimental value is currently assigned in the Command Numbers
   Registry, as indicated in the initial contents below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.4"><h4>3.1.4   OWAMP-Control Command Numbers Initial Contents</h4></a>

   OWAMP-Control Commands follows the procedure defined in Section 3.5
   of [RFC4656] and in the remainder of Section 3 of that document.
   The complete set of OWAMP-Control Command Numbers are as follows
   (including two reserved values):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      OWAMP-Control Command Numbers

      Value   Description             Semantics     Reference
                                      Definition

       255    Reserved                Section 3.1.4 RFC 7718

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   OWAMP-Modes</h3></a>

   IANA has created an OWAMP-Modes registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   Registry Specification</h4></a>

   OWAMP-Modes are specified in OWAMP Server Greeting messages and Set-
   up Response messages consistent with Section 3.1 of [RFC4656].  Modes
   are currently indicated by setting single bits in the 32-bit Modes
   field.  However, more complex encoding may be used in the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2   Registry Management</h4></a>

   Because the "OWAMP-Modes" are based on only 32 bit positions with
   each position conveying a unique feature, and because OWAMP is an
   IETF protocol, these registries MUST be updated only by "IETF Review"
   as specified in [RFC5226] (an RFC that documents registry use and is
   approved by the IESG).  IANA SHOULD allocate monotonically increasing
   bit positions when requested.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.3"><h4>3.2.3   Experimental Numbers</h4></a>

   No experimental bit positions are currently assigned in the Modes
   registry, as indicated in the initial contents below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.4"><h4>3.2.4   OWAMP-Modes Initial Contents</h4></a>

   OWAMP-Control connection establishment follows the procedure defined
   in Section 3.1 of [RFC4656].
   In the OWAMP-Modes registry, assignments are straightforward on the
   basis of bit positions, and there are no references to values -- this
   is a difference from the comparable TWAMP registry (and a topic for
   improvement in the TWAMP-Modes registry that is reconciled in
   [RFC7717]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An extension of the OWAMP-Modes is proposed in [RFC7717].  With this
   extension, the complete set of OWAMP Mode bit positions are as
   follows (including one reserved bit position):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OWAMP-Modes

   Bit                            Semantics

   2      Encrypted               Section 3.1    RFC 4656

          Secret Key               of RFC 7718,
                                  Section 5 of   RFC 7717
                                   of RFC 7717
   ------------------------------------------------------
   5-31   Unassigned

   In the original OWAMP Modes field, setting bit position 0, 1, or 2
   indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
   protocol inherited the same mode (see Section 4 of [RFC4656]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The value of the Modes field sent by the Server in the Server-
   Greeting message is the bit-wise OR of the modes (bit positions) that
   it is willing to support during this session.  Thus, the five least
   significant bits of the 32-bit Modes field are used.  When no other
   features are activated, the 27 most significant bits MUST be zero.  A
   Control-Client conforming to [RFC4656] MAY ignore the values in the
   29 most significant bits of the Modes field, or it MAY support
   features that are communicated in other bit positions, such as the
   IKEv2-derived Shared Secret Key extension [RFC7717].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OWAMP and TWAMP registries for Modes may grow to contain different
   features and functions due to the inherent differences in one-way and
   two-way measurement configurations and the metrics they measure.  No
   attempt will be made to coordinate them unnecessarily, except for the
   Reserved bit position 3 above.  This is available for assignment if a
   mixed security mode similar to [RFC5618] is defined for OWAMP; it
   would allow alignment with the comparable TWAMP feature.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   As this memo simply documents the creation of OWAMP registries, it
   presents no new security or privacy issues for the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and
   [RFC5357].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Privacy considerations for measurement systems, particularly when
   Internet users participate in the tests in some way, are described in
   [RFC7594].

   We thought Spencer Dawkins caught the last of the small errors in his
   AD review, but Nevil Brownlee found a few more during OPS-DIR review.
   Roni Even found our use of "IETF Consensus" was out of date with
