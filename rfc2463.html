	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   The Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of IP.  IPv6
   uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) as defined for IPv4
   [RFC-792], with a number of changes.  The resulting protocol is
   called ICMPv6, and has an IPv6 Next Header value of 58.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes the format of a set of control messages used
   in ICMPv6.  It does not describe the procedures for using these
   messages to achieve functions like Path MTU discovery; such
   procedures are described in other documents (e.g., [PMTU]).  Other
   documents may also introduce additional ICMPv6 message types, such as
   Neighbor Discovery messages [IPv6-DISC], subject to the general rules
   for ICMPv6 messages given in section 2 of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Terminology defined in the IPv6 specification [IPv6] and the IPv6
   Routing and Addressing specification [IPv6-ADDR] applies to this
   document as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  ICMPv6 (ICMP for IPv6)</h2></a>

   ICMPv6 is used by IPv6 nodes to report errors encountered in
   processing packets, and to perform other internet-layer functions,
   such as diagnostics (ICMPv6 "ping").  ICMPv6 is an integral part of
   IPv6 and MUST be fully implemented by every IPv6 node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1  Message General Format</h3></a>

   ICMPv6 messages are grouped into two classes: error messages and
   informational messages.  Error messages are identified as such by
   having a zero in the high-order bit of their message Type field
   values.  Thus, error messages have message Types from 0 to 127;
   informational messages have message Types from 128 to 255.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines the message formats for the following ICMPv6
   messages:
        ICMPv6 error messages:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             1    Destination Unreachable      (see section 3.1)
             2    Packet Too Big               (see section 3.2)
             3    Time Exceeded                (see section 3.3)
             4    Parameter Problem            (see section 3.4)

        ICMPv6 informational messages:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             128  Echo Request                 (see section 4.1)
             129  Echo Reply                   (see section 4.2)


   Every ICMPv6 message is preceded by an IPv6 header and zero or more
   IPv6 extension headers. The ICMPv6 header is identified by a Next
   Header value of 58 in the immediately preceding header.  (NOTE: this
   is different than the value used to identify ICMP for IPv4.)

   The ICMPv6 messages have the following general format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |     Code      |          Checksum             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      +                         Message Body                          +
      |                                                               |

   The type field indicates the type of the message. Its value
   determines the format of the remaining data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The code field depends on the message type. It is used to create an
   additional level of message granularity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The checksum field is used to detect data corruption in the ICMPv6
   message and parts of the IPv6 header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2  Message Source Address Determination</h3></a>

   A node that sends an ICMPv6 message has to determine both the Source
   and Destination IPv6 Addresses in the IPv6 header before calculating
   the checksum.  If the node has more than one unicast address, it must
   choose the Source Address of the message as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (a) If the message is a response to a message sent to one of the
        node's unicast addresses, the Source Address of the reply must
        be that same address.
    (b) If the message is a response to a message sent to a multicast or
        anycast group in which the node is a member, the Source Address
        of the reply must be a unicast address belonging to the
        interface on which the multicast or anycast packet was received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (c) If the message is a response to a message sent to an address
        that does not belong to the node, the Source Address should be
        that unicast address belonging to the node that will be most
        helpful in diagnosing the error. For example, if the message is
        a response to a packet forwarding action that cannot complete
        successfully, the Source Address should be a unicast address
        belonging to the interface on which the packet forwarding
        failed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (d) Otherwise, the node's routing table must be examined to
        determine which interface will be used to transmit the message
        to its destination, and a unicast address belonging to that
        interface must be used as the Source Address of the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3  Message Checksum Calculation</h3></a>

   The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
   sum of the entire ICMPv6 message starting with the ICMPv6 message
   type field, prepended with a "pseudo-header" of IPv6 header fields,
   as specified in [IPv6, section 8.1].  The Next Header value used in
   the pseudo-header is 58.  (NOTE: the inclusion of a pseudo-header in
   the ICMPv6 checksum is a change from IPv4; see [IPv6] for the
   rationale for this change.)

   For computing the checksum, the checksum field is set to zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4  Message Processing Rules</h3></a>

   Implementations MUST observe the following rules when processing
   ICMPv6 messages (from [RFC-1122]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (a) If an ICMPv6 error message of unknown type is received, it MUST
        be passed to the upper layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (b) If an ICMPv6 informational message of unknown type is received,
        it MUST be silently discarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (c) Every ICMPv6 error message (type < 128) includes as much of the
        IPv6 offending (invoking) packet (the packet that caused the
        error) as will fit without making the error message packet
        exceed the minimum IPv6 MTU [IPv6].
    (d) In those cases where the internet-layer protocol is required to
        pass an ICMPv6 error message to the upper-layer process, the
        upper-layer protocol type is extracted from the original packet
        (contained in the body of the ICMPv6 error message) and used to
        select the appropriate upper-layer process to handle the error.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        If the original packet had an unusually large amount of
        extension headers, it is possible that the upper-layer protocol
        type may not be present in the ICMPv6 message, due to truncation
        of the original packet to meet the minimum IPv6 MTU [IPv6]
        limit.  In that case, the error message is silently dropped
        after any IPv6-layer processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (e) An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be sent as a result of
        receiving:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (e.1) an ICMPv6 error message, or

         (e.2) a packet destined to an IPv6 multicast address (there are
               two exceptions to this rule: (1) the Packet Too Big<br>
               Message - Section 3.2 - to allow Path MTU discovery to
               work for IPv6 multicast, and (2) the Parameter Problem<br>
               Message, Code 2 - Section 3.4 - reporting an unrecognized
               IPv6 option that has the Option Type highest-order two
               bits set to 10), or

         (e.3) a packet sent as a link-layer multicast, (the exception
               from e.2 applies to this case too), or

         (e.4) a packet sent as a link-layer broadcast, (the exception
               from e.2 applies to this case too), or

         (e.5) a packet whose source address does not uniquely identify
               a single node -- e.g., the IPv6 Unspecified Address, an
               IPv6 multicast address, or an address known by the ICMP
               message sender to be an IPv6 anycast address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    (f) Finally, in order to limit the bandwidth and forwarding costs
        incurred sending ICMPv6 error messages, an IPv6 node MUST limit
        the rate of ICMPv6 error messages it sends.  This situation may
        occur when a source sending a stream of erroneous packets fails
        to heed the resulting ICMPv6 error messages.  There are a
        variety of ways of implementing the rate-limiting function, for
        example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (f.1) Timer-based - for example, limiting the rate of
               transmission of error messages to a given source, or to
               any source, to at most once every T milliseconds.
         (f.2) Bandwidth-based - for example, limiting the rate at which
               error messages are sent from a particular interface to
               some fraction F of the attached link's bandwidth.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        The limit parameters (e.g., T or F in the above examples) MUST
        be configurable for the node, with a conservative default value
        (e.g., T = 1 second, NOT 0 seconds, or F = 2 percent, NOT 100
        percent).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following sections describe the message formats for the above
   ICMPv6 messages.

   A Destination Unreachable message SHOULD be generated by a router, or
   by the IPv6 layer in the originating node, in response to a packet
   that cannot be delivered to its destination address for reasons other

   packet is dropped due to congestion.)

   If the reason for the failure to deliver is lack of a matching entry
   in the forwarding node's routing table, the Code field is set to 0
   (NOTE: this error can occur only in nodes that do not hold a "default
   route" in their routing tables).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the reason for the failure to deliver is administrative
   prohibition, e.g., a "firewall filter", the Code field is set to 1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If there is any other reason for the failure to deliver, e.g.,
   inability to resolve the IPv6 destination address into a

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1  Authentication and Encryption of ICMP messages</h3></a>

   ICMP protocol packet exchanges can be authenticated using the IP
   Authentication Header [IPv6-AUTH].  A node SHOULD include an
   Authentication Header when sending ICMP messages if a security
   association for use with the IP Authentication Header exists for the
   destination address.  The security associations may have been created
   through manual configuration or through the operation of some key
   management protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Received Authentication Headers in ICMP packets MUST be verified for
   correctness and packets with incorrect authentication MUST be ignored
   and discarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It SHOULD be possible for the system administrator to configure a
   node to ignore any ICMP messages that are not authenticated using
   either the Authentication Header or Encapsulating Security Payload.
   Such a switch SHOULD default to allowing unauthenticated messages.
   Confidentiality issues are addressed by the IP Security Architecture
   and the IP Encapsulating Security Payload documents [IPv6-SA, IPv6-
   ESP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2  ICMP Attacks</h3></a>

   ICMP messages may be subject to various attacks.  A complete
   discussion can be found in the IP Security Architecture [IPv6-SA].  A
   brief discussion of such attacks and their prevention is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. ICMP messages may be subject to actions intended to cause the
      receiver believe the message came from a different source than the
      message originator.  The protection against this attack can be
      achieved by applying the IPv6 Authentication mechanism [IPv6-Auth]
      to the ICMP message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. ICMP messages may be subject to actions intended to cause the
      message or the reply to it go to a destination different than the
      message originator's intention.  The ICMP checksum calculation
      provides a protection mechanism against changes by a malicious
      interceptor in the destination and source address of the IP packet
      carrying that message, provided the ICMP checksum field is
      protected against change by authentication [IPv6-Auth] or
      encryption [IPv6-ESP] of the ICMP message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. ICMP messages may be subject to changes in the message fields, or
      payload.  The authentication [IPv6-Auth] or encryption [IPv6-ESP]
      of the ICMP message is a protection against such actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4. ICMP messages may be used as attempts to perform denial of service
      attacks by sending back to back erroneous IP packets.  An
      implementation that correctly followed section 2.4, paragraph (f)
      of this specifications, would be protected by the ICMP error rate
      limiting mechanism.
