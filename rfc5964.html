       Specifying Holes in Location-to-Service Translation (LoST)
                           Service Boundaries

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes how holes can be specified in geodetic
   service boundaries.  One means of implementing a search solution in a
   service database, such as one might provide with a Location-to-
   Service Translation (LoST) server, is described.

   The LoST protocol [RFC5222] maps service and locations to destination
   addresses.  A LoST server does this by provisioning boundary maps or
   areas against service URNs.  The boundary is a polygon made up of
   sets of geodetic coordinates specifying an enclosed area.  In some
   circumstances, an area enclosed by a polygon, also known as an
   exterior polygon, may contain exception areas, or holes, that for the
   same service must yield a different destination to that described by
   the larger area.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes a profile of Geographic Markup Language (GML)
   [ISO-19107] polygons that constrains their representation when used
   for describing service boundaries.  The profile removes a number of
   permutations that are difficult to process.  This allows for
   simplified implementations that are not capable of handling all
   potential variations allowed by GML.  A fully conformant GML
   implementation must produce polygons that fit this profile to ensure
   interoperability.

   Figure 1: Holes in a Polygon

   This document describes a profile of GML [ISO-19107] polygons that
   constrains their representation when used for describing service
   boundaries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The working group considered that the types of regions described in
   this memo could be represented in various ways as polygons without
   holes, but concluded on the recommendations here to avoid potential
   problems with the arbitrary division of regions and to align with
   existing geospatial system practices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Specifying Holes</h2></a>

   Holes related to an exterior boundary polygon MUST adhere to the
   following rules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Rule 1:   Two holes MUST NOT have more than one point of
             intersection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If two or more holes overlap or share a common boundary, then these
   represent a single hole.  The internal elements (holes) should have
   common boundaries removed and a single hole created irrespective of
   whether the excluded area is itself made up of multiple service
   boundaries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 7 is used to illustrate two service boundaries.  The first

                 Figure 9: Service Boundary Specifications

   It is considered likely that LoST servers will need to provide
   responses sufficiently quickly to allow real-time queries to be
   performed as part of an emergency call routing flow.  It is for this
   reason that databases supporting native geospatial query techniques
   are desirable and that service boundary specifications that are
   easily mapped to internal data structures are preferred.  Using
   interior boundaries makes support for this operation easy, while
   allowing an arbitrary number of holes in a service boundary to be
   specified.
   Each polygon is stored in the geospatial database and mapped to a
   service URN and destination URI.  Many geospatial databases natively
   support polygons with interior exclusions.  Without native support,
   interior boundaries can be stored against the polygon and can checked
   separately.  A location falls within the area described by a polygon
   if it is within the exterior boundary and not within any interior
   boundary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the above example, if a location falls within the interior
   boundary, it maps to the "Inner Area Police" service; likewise, if a
   location falls within the exterior boundary, but not within the
   interior boundary, it maps to the "Outer Area Police" service.
