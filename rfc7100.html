        Retirement of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards"
                            Summary Document

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document updates RFC 2026 to no longer use STD 1 as a summary of
   "Internet Official Protocol Standards".  It obsoletes RFC 5000 and
   requests the IESG to move RFC 5000 (and therefore STD 1) to Historic
   status.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Retiring STD 1</h2></a>

   RFC 2026 [RFC2026] and its predecessors call for the publication of
   an RFC describing the status of IETF protocols:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The RFC Editor shall publish periodically an "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" RFC [1], summarizing the status of all
      Internet protocol and service specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "Internet Official Protocol Standards" document, now as RFC 5000
   [RFC5000], has always been listed in the Internet Standard series as
   STD 1.  However, the document has not been kept up to date in recent
   years, and it has fallen out of use in favor of the online list
   produced by the RFC Editor [STDS-TRK].  The IETF no longer sees the
   need for the document to be maintained.  Therefore, this document
   updates RFC 2026 [RFC2026], effectively removing the above-mentioned
   paragraph from Section 6.1.3, along with the paragraph from
   Section 2.1 that states:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The status of Internet protocol and service specifications is
      summarized periodically in an RFC entitled "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" [1].  This RFC shows the level of maturity and
      other helpful information for each Internet protocol or service
      specification (see section 3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   and the paragraph from Section 3.3 that states:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The "Official Protocol Standards" RFC (STD1) lists a general
      requirement level for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in
      this section.  This RFC is updated periodically.  In many cases,
      more detailed descriptions of the requirement levels of particular
      protocols and of individual features of the protocols will be
      found in appropriate ASs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, this document obsoletes RFC 5000 [RFC5000], the current
   incarnation of that document, and requests that the IESG move that
   document (and therefore STD 1) to Historic status.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, RFC 2026 [RFC2026] Section 6.1.3 also calls for the
   publication of an "official summary of standards actions completed
   and pending" in the Internet Society's newsletter.  This has also not
   been done in recent years, and the "publication of record" for
   standards actions has for some time been the minutes of the IESG
   [IESG-MINUTES].  Therefore, that paragraph is also effectively
   removed from Section 6.1.3.
