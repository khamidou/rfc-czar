   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing RIP Version 2.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  The Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,
      an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Objects</h2></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1  Format of Definitions</h3></a>

   Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [9].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Textual Conventions</h3></a>

   Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this
   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of
   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the
   these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The new data types are: Validation (the standard "set to invalid
   causes deletion" type), and RouteTag.   The RouteTag type represents
   the contents of the Route Tag field in the packet header or route
   entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Structure of MIB</h3></a>

   The RIP-2 MIB contains global counters useful for detecting the
   deleterious effects of RIP incompatibilities, an "interfaces" table
   which contains interface-specific statistics and configuration
   information, and an optional "neighbor" table containing information
   that may be helpful in debugging neighbor relationships.  Like the
   protocol itself, this MIB takes great care to preserve compatibility
   with RIP-1 systems, and controls for monitoring and controlling
   system interactions.
