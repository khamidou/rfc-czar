	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This specification defines the "Authentication-Info" and "Proxy-
   Authentication-Info" response header fields for use in HTTP
   authentication schemes ([RFC7235]) that need to return information
   once the client's authentication credentials have been accepted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both were previously defined in Section 3 of [RFC2617], defining the
   HTTP "Digest" authentication scheme.  This document generalizes the
   description for use not only in "Digest" ([RFC7616]), but also in
   other future schemes that might have the same requirements for
   carrying additional information during authentication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Notational Conventions</h2></a>

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] with a list extension, defined in Section 7 of
   [RFC7230], that allows for compact definition of comma-separated
   lists using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates
   repetition).  The ABNF production for "auth-param" is defined in
   Section 2.1 of [RFC7235].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   The Authentication-Info Response Header Field</h2></a>

   HTTP authentication schemes can use the Authentication-Info response
   header field to communicate information after the client's
   authentication credentials have been accepted.  This information can
   include a finalization message from the server (e.g., it can contain
   the server authentication).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The field value is a list of parameters (name/value pairs), using the
   "auth-param" syntax defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC7235].  This
   specification only describes the generic format; authentication
   schemes using Authentication-Info will define the individual
   parameters.  The "Digest" Authentication Scheme, for instance,
   defines multiple parameters in Section 3.5 of [RFC7616].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Authentication-Info = #auth-param

   The Authentication-Info header field can be used in any HTTP
   response, independently of request method and status code.  Its
   semantics are defined by the authentication scheme indicated by the
   Authorization header field ([RFC7235], Section 4.2) of the
   corresponding request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A proxy forwarding a response is not allowed to modify the field
   value in any way.
   Authentication-Info can be used inside trailers ([RFC7230],
   Section 4.1.2) when the authentication scheme explicitly allows this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Parameter Value Format</h3></a>

   Parameter values can be expressed either as "token" or as "quoted-
   string" (Section 3.2.6 of [RFC7230]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Authentication scheme definitions need to allow both notations, both
   for senders and recipients.  This allows recipients to use generic
   parsing components, independent of the authentication scheme in use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For backwards compatibility, authentication scheme definitions can
   restrict the format for senders to one of the two variants.  This can
   be important when it is known that deployed implementations will fail
   when encountering one of the two formats.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   The Proxy-Authentication-Info Response Header Field</h2></a>

   The Proxy-Authentication-Info response header field is equivalent to
   Authentication-Info, except that it applies to proxy authentication
   ([RFC7235], Section 2) and its semantics are defined by the
   authentication scheme indicated by the Proxy-Authorization header
   field ([RFC7235], Section 4.4) of the corresponding request:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Proxy-Authentication-Info = #auth-param

   However, unlike Authentication-Info, the Proxy-Authentication-Info
   header field applies only to the next outbound client on the response
   chain.  This is because only the client that chose a given proxy is
   likely to have the credentials necessary for authentication.
   However, when multiple proxies are used within the same
   administrative domain, such as office and regional caching proxies
   within a large corporate network, it is common for credentials to be
   generated by the user agent and passed through the hierarchy until
   consumed.  Hence, in such a configuration, it will appear as if
   Proxy-Authentication-Info is being forwarded because each proxy will
   send the same field value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Adding information to HTTP responses that are sent over an
   unencrypted channel can affect security and privacy.  The presence of
   the header fields alone indicates that HTTP authentication is in use.
   Additional information could be exposed by the contents of the
   authentication-scheme specific parameters; this will have to be
   considered in the definitions of these schemes.
	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   HTTP header fields are registered within the "Message Headers"
   registry located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   message-headers>, as defined by [BCP90].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document updates the definitions of the "Authentication-Info"
   and "Proxy-Authentication-Info" header fields, so the "Permanent
   Message Header Field Names" registry has been updated accordingly:
