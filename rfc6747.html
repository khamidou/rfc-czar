   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has had
   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP
   is one of the recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately,
   various refereed research papers on ILNP have also been published
   during this decade.  So, the ideas contained herein have had much
   broader review than the IRTF Routing RG.  The views in this
   document were considered controversial by the Routing RG, but the
   RG reached a consensus that the document still should be
   published.  The Routing RG has had remarkably little consensus on
   anything, so virtually all Routing RG outputs are considered
   controversial.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At present, the Internet research and development community are
   exploring various approaches to evolving the Internet
   Architecture to solve a variety of issues including, but not
   limited to, scalability of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide
   range of other issues (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming,
   site/subnet mobility, node mobility) are also active concerns at
   present.  Several different classes of evolution are being
   considered by the Internet research and development community.  One
   class is often called "Map and Encapsulate", where traffic would
   be mapped and then tunnelled through the inter-domain core of the
   Internet.  Another class being considered is sometimes known as
   "Identifier/Locator Split".  This document relates to a proposal
   that is in the latter class of evolutionary approaches.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is a proposal for
   evolving the Internet Architecture.  It differs from the current
   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating the concept of an
   IP Address, and instead defining two new objects, each having
   crisp syntax and semantics.  The first new object is the Locator, a
   topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The other new object is
   the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for a
   node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   ILNP Document Roadmap</h3></a>

   This document describes extensions to ARP for use with
   ILNPv4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ILNP architecture can have more than one engineering
   instantiation.  For example, one can imagine a "clean-slate"
   engineering design based on the ILNP architecture.  In separate
   documents, we describe two specific engineering instances of
   ILNP.  The term ILNPv6 refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that
   is based upon, and backwards compatible with, IPv6.  The term ILNPv4
   refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is based upon, and
   backwards compatible with, IPv4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Many engineering aspects common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   ARP Extensions for ILNPv4</h2></a>

   ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4) is merely a different instantiation of the
   ILNP architecture, so it retains the crisp distinction between the
   Locator and the Identifier.  As with ILNPv6, only the Locator
   values are used for routing and forwarding ILNPv4 packets
   [RFC6740].  As with ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6), when ILNPv4 is used
   for a network-layer session, the upper-layer protocols (e.g.,
   TCP/UDP pseudo-header checksum, IPsec Security Association) bind
   only to the Identifiers, never to the Locators [RFC6741].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, just as the packet format for IPv4 is different to IPv6,
   so the engineering details for ILNPv4 are different also.  While
   ILNPv6 is carefully engineered to be fully backwards-compatible
   with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, ILNPv4 relies upon an extended
   version of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC826], which
   is defined here.  While ILNPv4 could have been engineered to avoid
   changes in ARP, that would have required that the ILNPv4 Locator
   (i.e., L32) have slightly different semantics, which was
   architecturally undesirable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The packet formats used are direct extensions of the existing
   widely deployed ARP Request (OP code 1) and ARP Reply (OP code 2)
   packet formats.  This design was chosen for practical engineering
   reasons (i.e., to maximise code reuse), rather than for maximum
   protocol design purity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We anticipate that ILNPv6 is much more likely to be widely
   implemented and deployed than ILNPv4.  However, having a clear
   definition of ILNPv4 helps demonstrate the difference between
   architecture and engineering, and also demonstrates that the
   common ILNP architecture can be instantiated in different ways
   with different existing network-layer protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   ILNPv4 ARP Request Packet Format</h3></a>

   The ILNPv4 ARP Request is an extended version of the widely
   deployed ARP Request (OP code 1).  For experimentation purposes,
   the ILNPv4 ARP Request OP code uses decimal value 24.  It is
   important to note that decimal value 24 is a pre-defined,
   shared-use experimental OP code for ARP [RFC5494], and is not
   uniquely assigned to ILNPv4 ARP Requests.  The ILNPv4 ARP Request
   extension permits the Node Identifier (NID) values to be carried
   in the ARP message, in addition to the node's 32-bit Locator
   (L32) values [RFC6742].

   In Figure 2.2, the fields are as follows:

     PT      Protocol Type (*)
     HAL     Hardware Address Length (*)

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The field descriptions marked with "*" should have the same values as
   for ARP as used for IPv4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Operation and Implementation of ARP for ILNPv4</h3></a>

   The operation of ARP for ILNPv4 is almost identical to that for IPv4.
   Essentially, the key differences are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      a) where an IPv4 ARP Request would use IPv4 addresses, an ILNPv4
         ARP Request MUST use:
         1. a 32-bit L32 value (_L32 suffixes in Figures 2.1 and 2.2)
         2. a 64-bit NID value (_NID suffixes in Figures 2.1 and 2.2)

      b) where an IPv4 ARP Reply would use IPv4 addresses, an ILNPv4 ARP
         Reply MUST use:
         1. a 32-bit L32 value (_L32 suffixes in Figures 2.1 and 2.2)
         2. a 64-bit NID value (_NID suffixes in Figures 2.1 and 2.2)

   As the OP codes 24 and 25 are distinct from ARP for IPv4, but the
   packet formats in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 are, effectively, extended
   versions of the corresponding ARP packets.  It should be possible to
   implement this extension of ARP by extending existing ARP
   implementations rather than having to write an entirely new
   implementation for ILNPv4.  It should be emphasised, however, that OP
   codes 24 and 25 are for experimental use as defined in [RFC5494], and
   so it is possible that other experimental protocols could be using
   these OP codes concurrently.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security considerations for the overall ILNP architecture are
   described in [RFC6740].  Additional common security considerations
   applicable to ILNP are described in [RFC6741].  This section
   describes security considerations specific to the specific ILNPv4
   topics discussed in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The existing widely deployed Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for
   IPv4 is a link-layer protocol, so it is not vulnerable to off-link
   attackers.  In this way, it is a bit different than IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (ND); IPv6 ND is a subset of the Internet Control Message
   Protocol (ICMP), which runs over IPv6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, ARP does not include any form of authentication, so current
   ARP deployments are vulnerable to a range of attacks from on-link
   nodes.  For example, it is possible for one node on a link to forge
   an ARP packet claiming to be from another node, thereby "stealing"
   the other node's IPv4 address.  [RFC5227] describes several of these
   risks and some measures that an ARP implementation can use to reduce
   the chance of accidental IPv4 address misconfiguration and also to
   detect such misconfiguration if it should occur.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This extension does not change the security risks that are inherent
   in using ARP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In situations where additional protection against on-link attackers
   is needed (for example, within high-risk operational environments),
   the IEEE standards for link-layer security [IEEE-802.1-AE] SHOULD be
   implemented and deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementers of this specification need to understand that the two OP
   code values used for these 2 extensions are not uniquely assigned to
   ILNPv4.  Other experimenters might be using the same two OP code
   values at the same time for different ARP-related experiments.
   Absent prior coordination among all users of a particular IP
   subnetwork, different experiments might be occurring on the same IP
   subnetwork.  So, implementations of these two ARP extensions ought to
   be especially defensively coded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document makes no request of IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If in the future the IETF decided to standardise ILNPv4, then
   allocation of unique ARP OP codes for the two extensions above would
   be sensible as part of the IETF standardisation process.
