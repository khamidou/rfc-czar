	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes the conventions for using several
   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   encrypted key package content type [RFC6032].  Specifically, it
   includes conventions necessary to implement the following CMS content
   types: EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], and
   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers
   to previously defined algorithms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Terminology</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   EnvelopedData</h2></a>

   EnvelopedData [RFC5652] supports a number of key management
   techniques.  Implementations that claim conformance to this document
   MUST support the key transport mechanisms and SHOULD support the key
   agreement mechanisms as defined below.  Other techniques MAY be
   supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When key transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be
   supported and RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption
   Padding (RSAES-OAEP) [RFC3560] SHOULD be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When key agreement is used, Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman (DH)
   [RFC3370] MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since the content type is used to carry a cryptographic key and its
   attributes, an algorithm that is traditionally used to encrypt one
   key with another is employed.  Regardless of the key management
   technique choice, implementations MUST support AES-128 Key Wrap with
   Padding [RFC5649] as the content-encryption algorithm.
   Implementations SHOULD support AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding
   [RFC5649] as the content-encryption algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When key agreement is used, a key wrap algorithm is also specified to
   wrap the content-encryption key.  If the content-encryption algorithm
   is AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap algorithm MUST be
   AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  If the content-encryption
   algorithm is AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap
   algorithm MUST be AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   EncryptedData</h2></a>

   EncryptedData [RFC5652] requires that keys be managed by other means;
   therefore, the only algorithm specified is the content-encryption
   algorithm.  Since the content type is used to carry a cryptographic
   key and its attributes, an algorithm that is traditionally used to
   encrypt one key with another is employed.  Implementations MUST
   support AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  Implementations
   SHOULD support AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   AuthEnvelopedData</h2></a>

   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083], like EnvelopedData, supports a number of
   key management techniques.  The key management requirements for
   AuthEnvelopedData are the same as for EnvelopedData.  The difference
   is the content-encryption algorithm.  Implementations MUST support
   128-bit AES-Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) [RFC5084] and SHOULD
   support 256-bit AES-GCM [RFC5084].  Implementations MAY also support
   AES-Counter with CBC-MAC (AES-CCM) [RFC5084].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Signed Data</h2></a>

   Implementations of SignedData [RFC5652] MUST support the signature
   scheme RSA [RFC3370] [RFC5754] and SHOULD support the signature
   schemes RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS) [RFC4056] and
   Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) [RFC3370] [RFC5754].  Additionally,
   implementations MUST support in concert with these signature schemes
   the hash function SHA-256 [RFC5754] and it SHOULD support the hash
   function SHA-1 [RFC3370].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Public Key Sizes</h2></a>

   The easiest way to implement SignedData, EnvelopedData, and
   AuthEnvelopedData is with public key certificates [RFC5280].  If an
   implementation supports RSA, RSAES-OAEP, DH, RSASSA-PSS, or DSA, then
   it MUST support key lengths from 1024 bits to 2048 bits, inclusive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3560], [RFC4056],
   [RFC5083], [RFC5084], [RFC5649], [RFC5652], [RFC5754], and [RFC6032]
   apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The choice of content-encryption algorithms for this document was
   based on [RFC5649]: "In the design of some high assurance
   cryptographic modules, it is desirable to segregate cryptographic
   keying material from other data.  The use of a specific cryptographic
   mechanism solely for the protection of cryptographic keying material
   can assist in this goal".  Unfortunately, there is no AES-GCM or
   AES-CCM mode that provides the same properties.  If an AES-GCM and
   AES-CCM mode that provides the same properties is defined, then this
   document will be updated to adopt that algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits of security for some algorithms
   and key sizes. [SP800-57] also provides time frames during which
   certain numbers of bits of security are appropriate, and some
   environments may find these time frames useful.
