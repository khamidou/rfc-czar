                    ESSCertIDv2 Update for RFC 3161

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document updates RFC 3161.  It allows the use of ESSCertIDv2, as
   defined in RFC 5035, to specify the hash of a signer certificate when
   the hash is calculated with a function other than the Secure Hash
   Algorithm (SHA-1).

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The time-stamping protocol defined in RFC 3161 [RFC3161] requires
   that the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData [RFC5652],
   used to apply a digital signature on the time-stamp token, include a
   signed attribute that identifies the signer's certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This identifier only allows SHA-1 [SHA1] to be used as the hash
   algorithm to generate the identifier value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mechanism used in [RFC3161] employed ESSCertID from RFC 2634
   [ESS].  RFC 5035 [ESSV2] updated ESSCertID with ESSCertIDv2 to allow
   the use of any hash algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The changes to RFC 3161 [RFC3161] defined in this document allow
   ESSCertIDv2 to be used to include an identifier of the signing
   certificate as defined in RFC 5035 [ESSV2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Terminology</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Last paragraph on Page 5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Old:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the certReq field is present and set to true, the TSA's public
      key certificate that is referenced by the ESSCertID identifier
      inside a SigningCertificate attribute in the response MUST be
      provided by the TSA in the certificates field from the SignedData
      structure in that response.  That field may also contain other
      certificates.

      [ESSV2] field inside a SigningCertificateV2 attribute in the
      response MUST be provided by the TSA in the certificates field
      from the SignedData structure in that response.  That field may
      also contain other certificates.

   Fifth paragraph on Page 8, just before the definition of TSTInfo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Old:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The time-stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than
      the signature of the TSA.  The certificate identifier (ESSCertID)
      of the TSA certificate MUST be included as a signerInfo attribute
      inside a SigningCertificate attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   New:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The time-stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than
      the signature of the TSA.  The certificate identifier (either
      ESSCertID [ESS] or ESSCertIDv2 [ESSV2]) of the TSA certificate
      MUST be included as a signerInfo attribute inside a
      SigningCertificate attribute.
      Note: As mentioned in RFC 5035 [ESSV2], the SigningCertificateV2
            attribute MUST be used if any algorithm other than SHA-1 is
            used and SHOULD NOT be used for SHA-1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note: For backwards compatibility, in line with RFC 5035, both
            ESSCertID and ESSCertIDv2 MAY be present.  Systems MAY
            ignore ESSCertIDv2 if RFC 5035 has not been implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.2"><h4>2.2.2   Verifying the Time-Stamp Token</h4></a>

   Third paragraph on Page 11.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Old:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The purpose of the tsa field is to give a hint in identifying the
      name of the TSA.  If present, it MUST correspond to one of the
      subject names included in the certificate that is to be used to
      verify the token.  However, the actual identification of the
      entity that signed the response will always occur through the use
      of the certificate identifier (ESSCertID Attribute) inside a
      SigningCertificate attribute which is part of the signerInfo (See
      Section 5 of [ESS]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document incorporates the security considerations of RFC 5035
   [ESSV2] with further explanations in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ESSCertID provides a means based on the SHA-1 hash algorithm for
   identifying the certificate used to verify the signature on a time
   stamp.  The use of ESSCertIDv2 aims to enable implementers to comply
   with policies that require phasing out all uses of the SHA-1
   algorithm.
   The update provided by this document is motivated by reasons of
   interoperability and migration to other hash algorithms rather than
   mitigating new security issues.
