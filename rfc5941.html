	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Financial organizations and merchants that offer online access to
   their services frequently encounter fraud perpetrated against their
   customers' accounts.  In their attempts to combat these frauds, the
   organizations and their law enforcement agencies could benefit
   greatly by sharing intelligence about fraud incidents and patterns
   with similar organizations and agencies.  This specification
   standardizes a document format by which they can share such
   information.  It is intended to facilitate multi-vendor
   interoperability between conformant components of an open fraud
   reporting framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information sharing can take place directly between financial
   organizations and merchants.  However, the power of shared
   intelligence is multiplied many times if the information is gathered
   from multiple sources by a shared network, consolidated, and
   redistributed to participants.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this arrangement, incident reports submitted to the network are
   called "inbound reports", and reports issued by the network are
   called "outbound reports".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Inbound reports will be submitted using a push-style protocol (such
   as email or the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)).  Outbound
   reports will be distributed using either a push-style protocol or a
   request/response protocol (such as HTTP).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Inbound reports identify the contributor of the report, as this
   information is essential in evaluating the quality of the information
   it contains and in contacting the source for the purpose of
   clarification.  However, outbound reports commonly do not identify
   the original sources, as those sources may not wish to be identified
   to other subscribers.  Such reports should, instead, identify the
   consolidator as the source.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A report may describe a particular transaction that is known to be,
   or believed to be, fraudulent, or it may describe a pattern of
   behavior that is believed to be indicative of fraud.  The former type
   of report is called an "activity report" and the latter a "signature
   report".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The schema defined herein extends the IODEF XML incident reporting
   schema [RFC5070].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In Section 3, we introduce the actors in a typical transaction fraud.
   Fraud reporting by means of an IODEF-Document is described in
   Section 4.  We define the elements of a Thraud Report in Section 5.
   In Section 6, we describe the Activity Thraud Report profile of the
   IODEF specification.  In Section 7, the profile for a Signature
   Thraud Report is described.  In Section 8, we define new attribute
   values for the IODEF Incident class.  Security considerations are
   described in Section 9.  Section 10 contains IANA considerations
   regarding the registration of the associated media sub-type and XML
   namespace identifier.  The Appendices contain the complete XML schema
   and a sample Thraud Report.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Data elements in this document are expressed in Unified Modeling
   Language (UML) syntax [UML].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   XML namespace prefixes are used throughout this document to stand for
   their respective XML namespaces, as follows.

                   Figure 1.  Transaction Fraud Elements

   Transaction fraud activities normally involve the following actors:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Fraudsters: individuals or organizations that collect victims'
       login credentials using a variety of means, including phishing
       and malware, and verify them (usually by attempting to log in to
       the victim's account).  Then, the Fraudsters may either recruit
       Fraud Executors themselves or wholesale the victims' credentials
       to other Fraudsters, who will, in turn, recruit Fraud Executors.
   2.  Fraud Executors: individuals who attempt the fraudulent funds
       transfer or payment.  In the case of fraudulent funds transfers,
       an account at either the same financial organization as that of
       the victim or a different one is opened as the destination
       account for the fraudulent transfer.  Alternatively, a fraudulent
       payment is made using a check or electronic transfer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  Victims of both credential theft and transaction fraud.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  Financial organizations that hold the victim's and the Fraud
       Executor's accounts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  Sensors at the financial organization that detect fraudulent
       transaction attempts, either in real-time or after the fact.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The intention of Thraud reporting is to enable any organization that
   has detected fraud to share this information, either internally or
   with other potential victim organizations.  The receiving
   organization can use this information, for example, to institute
   manual review of transactions initiated from suspicious IP addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IODEF-Document Incident Class</h2></a>

   A Thraud Report SHALL be an instance of the IODEF-Document class, as
   defined in [RFC5070].  The report SHALL contain at least one Incident
   object, as defined in [RFC5070].  Each Incident object SHOULD contain
   information about a single fraud strategy.  One Incident object MAY
   contain information about multiple fraudulent transactions that are
   consistent with the same fraud strategy.  Each fraudulent transaction
   SHALL be described in a separate EventData object.  The data model
   for the Incident class is defined in [RFC5070] and is repeated here,
   as Figure 2, for the reader's convenience.

                Figure 2.  Data Model of the Incident Class

   The AdditionalData abstract class is an extension point in the schema
   of the EventData class.  Implementers SHALL include exactly one of
   the following objects in AdditionalData: FraudEventPayment,
   FraudEventTransfer, FraudEventIdentity, or FraudEventOther.
   Collectively, these are known as Thraud Records.  The corresponding
   classes are defined by this specification in Section 5, below.

   This document describes a document format for exchanging information
   about successful or attempted transaction and authentication fraud
   incidents.  The information is intended to be used to improve the
   effectiveness of participants' fraud detection and prevention
   programs.  The effectiveness of such programs depends critically on
   the accuracy, reliability, confidentiality, and timeliness of both
   the information and the participants in its exchange.  Threats to
   accuracy, reliability, and confidentiality include (but are not
   limited to) those described here.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Fraudsters may attempt to introduce reports that delete or modify
   incident information in the corpus.  Therefore, origin authentication
   MUST be employed.  Human review SHOULD be performed prior to
   implementing modifications to the corpus.
   Fraudsters may attempt to interrupt or redirect submissions, thereby
   preventing the sharing of intelligence concerning their fraud
   strategies.  Therefore, authenticated receipts SHOULD be employed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Fraudsters may attempt to impersonate legitimate submitters, thereby
   poisoning their reputations and rendering ineffective their future
   submissions.  Origin authentication MUST be used to ensure that the
   sources of reports are properly identified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Fraudsters that can view incident reports may adapt their fraud
   strategies to avoid detection.  Therefore, reports MUST be protected
   by confidentiality services including transport encryption and access
   control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to prevent inadvertent disclosure of incident data, incident
   reports SHOULD be encrypted while in storage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The submitter of an incident report may incorrectly identify
   legitimate activity as a fraud incident.  This may lead to denial of
   service by a receiving organization that relies on the report or
   information derived from the report.  Receiving organizations SHOULD
   operate a reputation service, in which the reliability of the
   information from particular sources is assessed and tracked and
   subsequent reports are weighted accordingly.  The source of reports
   MUST be authenticated.  Receiving organizations SHOULD use reports to
   step up authentication assurance, rather than simply denying service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A receiving organization may misuse a Thraud Report to deny service,
   resulting in a loss for a legitimate user.  If such a user were to
   learn the identity of the source of the information that led to the
   denial of service, then that source may become implicated in any
   resulting claim for compensation.  This, in turn, may discourage
   reporting organizations from participating in intelligence sharing.
   Therefore, original sources SHOULD NOT be identified in consolidated
   reports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any origin authentication and data integrity mechanism that is
   acceptable to both parties MAY be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any transport confidentiality mechanism that is acceptable to both
   parties MAY be used.
