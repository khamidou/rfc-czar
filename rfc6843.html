	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Packet Delay Metrics Block</h3></a>

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum, and maximum values of
   the network round-trip delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP end
   systems as measured, for example, using the RTCP method described in
   [RFC3550].  It also supports reporting of the component of the round-
   trip delay internal to the local RTP system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The network metrics belong to the class of transport metrics defined
   in [RFC6792].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   RTCP and RTCP XR Reports</h3></a>

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].
	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   Performance Metrics Framework</h3></a>

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guidelines for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The metrics block described in this
   document is in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and
   [RFC6792].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4"><h3>1.4   Applicability</h3></a>

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications in which
   this report block would be useful, such as multimedia conferencing
   and streaming audio and video.  Knowledge of the round-trip delay and
   delay characteristics can aid other receivers in sizing their receive
   buffers and selecting a playout delay.  The same information is also
   valuable to network managers in troubleshooting network and user
   experience issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Standards Language</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Delay Block</h2></a>

   Metrics in this block report on packet delay in the stream arriving
   at the RTP system.  The measurement of these metrics is made either
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream or at the sending end of the
   RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics block refer by synchronization
   source (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block
   [RFC6776], which contains measurement periods (see [RFC6776], Section
   4.2).  This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report and
   SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement
   Information block.  If the measurement period is not received in the
   same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block, this metrics block
   MUST be discarded.

                     Figure 1: Report Block Structure

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Definition of Fields in Delay Metrics Report Block</h3></a>

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Delay Report Block is identified by the constant 16.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the delay metrics are
      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.
   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the delay block, the block length is equal to 6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Mean Network Round-Trip Delay: 32 bits

      The Mean Network Round-Trip Delay is the mean value of the RTP-to-
      RTP interface round-trip delay over the measurement period,
      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically
      determined using "the NTP timestamp field" in the RTCP sender
      report (SR) and "the last SR (LSR) field","delay since last SR
      (DLSR) field" in the RTCP receiver report (RR) (see [RFC3550],
      Section 6.4.1 and Figure 2).  It also can be determined using "the
      NTP timestamp field" in the RTCP Receiver Reference Time Report
      Block and "last RR (LRR) field", "delay since last RR (DLRR)
      field" in the DLRR Report Block (see [RFC3611], Section 4.5).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If only one measurement of Round-Trip Delay is available for the
      time span of the report (i.e., the measurement period) (whether
      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as
      the mean value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Min Network Round-Trip Delay: 32 bits

      The Min Network Round Trip Delay is the minimum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round-trip delay over the measurement period,
      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically
      determined using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP SR and LSR
      field and DLSR field in the RTCP RR.  It also can be determined
      using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP Receiver Reference Time
      Report Block and LRR field and DLRR field in the DLRR Report
      Block.
      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      time span of the report (i.e., the measurement period) (whether
      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as
      the minimum value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Max Network Round-Trip Delay: 32 bits

      The Max Network Round-Trip Delay is the maximum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round-trip delay over the measurement period,
      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically
      determined using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP SR and LSR
      field and DLSR field in the RTCP RR.  It also can be determined
      using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP Receiver Reference Time
      Report Block and LRR field and DLRR field in the DLRR Report
      Block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If only one measurement of Round-Trip Delay is available for the
      time span of the report (i.e.,the measurement period) (whether
      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as
      the maximum value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   End System Delay: 64 bits

      The End System Delay is the internal round-trip delay within the
      reporting endpoint, calculated using the nominal value of the
      jitter buffer delay plus the accumulation/encoding and decoding/
      playout delay associated with the codec being used.  The value of
      this field is represented using a 64-bit NTP-format timestamp as
      defined in [RFC5905], which is a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point
      number with the integer part in the first 32 bits and the
      fractional part in the last 32 bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   SDP Signaling</h2></a>

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.
	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension</h3></a>

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   xr-format =/ xr-delay-block

   xr-delay-block ="delay"

	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Offer/Answer Usage</h3></a>

   When SDP is used in offer/answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] applies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   New RTCP XR Block Type Value</h3></a>

   This document assigns the block type value 16 in the IANA "RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" to
   the "Delay Metrics Block".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   New RTCP XR SDP Parameter</h3></a>

   This document also registers a new parameter "delay" in the "RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Contact Information for Registrations</h3></a>

      The contact information for the registrations is:

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3, of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
