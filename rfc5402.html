                   Compressed Data within an Internet
               Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Message

   This document explains the rules and procedures for utilizing
   compression (RFC 3274) within an Internet EDI (Electronic Data
   Interchange) 'AS' message, as defined in RFCs 3335, 4130, and 4823.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Historically, electronic messages produced by systems following the
   guidelines as outlined in the IETF EDIINT Working Group
   specifications AS1 [AS1], AS2 [AS2], and AS3 [AS3] did not have a way
   to provide a standardized transport neutral mechanism for compressing
   large payloads.  However, with the development of RFC 3274,
   "Compressed Data Content Type for Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS)", we now have a transport-neutral mechanism for compressing
   large payloads.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A typical EDIINT 'AS' message is a multi-layered MIME message,
   consisting of one or more of the following: payload layer, signature
   layer, and/or encryption layer.  When an 'AS' message is received, a
   Message Integrity Check (MIC) value must be computed based upon
   defined rules within the EDIINT 'AS' RFCs and must be returned to the
   sender of the message via a Message Disposition Notification (MDN).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The addition of a new compression layer will require this document to
   outline new procedures for building/layering 'AS' messages and
   computing a MIC value that is returned in the MDN receipt.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Compressed Data MIME Layer</h2></a>

   The compressed-data CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) MIME entity as
   described in [COMPRESSED-DATA] may encapsulate a MIME entity that
   consists of either an unsigned or signed business document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementers are to follow the appropriate specifications identified
   in the "MIME Media Types" registry [MIME-TYPES] maintained by IANA
   for the type of object being packaged.  For example, to package an
   XML object, the MIME media type of "application/xml" is used in the
   Content-Type MIME header field and the specifications for enveloping
   the object are contained in [XMLTYPES].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MIME entity example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Content-type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!-- sample xml document -->
   The MIME entity will be compressed using [ZLIB] and placed inside a
   CMS compressed-data object as outlined in [COMPRESSED-DATA].  The
   compressed-data object will be MIME encapsulated according to details
   outlined in [S/MIME3.1], RFC 3851, Section 3.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=compressed-data;
   name=smime.p7z
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=smime.p7z

   Note: Content-Transfer-Encoding of base64 would only be required if
   the compressed-data MIME bodypart is transferred via a 7-bit protocol
   like SMTP and is visible in the outer layer of the MIME message.  If
   the compressed-data MIME bodypart is placed inside of an encrypted
   MIME bodypart, content-transfer-encoding would not be required on the
   compressed-data MIME bodypart, but would be required on the encrypted
   MIME bodypart.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Structure of an EDI MIME Compressed Message</h2></a>

   When compressing a document that will be signed, the application MAY
   compress the innermost MIME body before signing (see Sections 3.2 and
   3.5), or it MAY compress the outer multipart/signed MIME body (see
   Sections 3.3 and 3.6), but it MUST NOT do both within the same
   document.  The receiving application MUST support both methods of
   compression when unpackaging an inbound document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note: The following sections (3.1 - 3.6) show the individual layers
   of a properly formatted EDI MIME message with a compressed data
   layer.  Please refer to the appropriate RFCs for the proper
   construction of the resulting MIME message.  "application/xxxxxxx" is
   used to indicate an application media subtype.

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   MIC Calculation for Signed Message</h3></a>

   For any signed message, the MIC to be returned is calculated over the

   compressed or uncompressed data.
