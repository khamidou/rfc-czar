                  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Discussion

   The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track
   documents and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs).
   The intent of the standards track documents is clear, and culminates
   in an official Internet Standard.  Informational RFCs can be
   published on a less formal basis, subject to the reasonable
   constraints of the RFC Editor.  Informational RFCs are not subject to
   peer review and carry no significance whatsoever within the IETF
   process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IETF currently has no mechanism or means of publishing documents
   that express its deep concern about something important, but
   otherwise contain absolutely no useful information whatsoever.  This
   document creates a new subseries of RFCs, entitled, IETF Statements
   Of Boredom (SOBs).  The SOB process is similar to that of the normal
   standards track.  The SOB is submitted to the IAB, the IRSG, the
   IESG, the SOB Editor (Morpheus), and the Academie Francais for
   review, analysis, reproduction in triplicate, translation into ASN.1,
   and distribution to Internet insomniacs.  However, once everyone has
   approved the document by falling asleep over it, the process ends and
   the document is discarded.  The resulting vacuum is viewed as having
   the technical approval of the IETF, but it is not, and cannot become,
   an official Internet Standard.
