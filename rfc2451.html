   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [Kent98] provides
   confidentiality for IP datagrams by encrypting the payload data to be
   protected.  This specification describes the ESP use of CBC-mode
   cipher algorithms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While this document does not describe the use of the default cipher
   algorithm DES, the reader should be familiar with that document.
   [Madson98]

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in the "Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"
   [Atkinson95], "IP Security Document Roadmap" [Thayer97], and "IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)" [Kent98] documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Furthermore, this document is a companion to [Kent98] and MUST be
   read in its context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1  Specification of Requirements</h3></a>

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   and "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [Bradner97].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2  Intellectual Property Rights Statement</h3></a>

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Cipher Algorithms</h2></a>

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and variables.  These include mode, key size, weak keys, block size,
   and rounds.  All of which will be explained below.
   While this document illustrates certain cipher algorithms such as
   Blowfish [Schneier93], CAST-128 [Adams97], 3DES, IDEA [Lai] [MOV],
   and RC5 [Baldwin96], any other block cipher algorithm may be used
   with ESP if all of the variables described within this document are
   clearly defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1  Mode</h3></a>

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms described or insinuated within
   this document use Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.  This mode
   requires an Initialization Vector (IV) that is the same size as the
   block size.  Use of a randomly generated IV prevents generation of
   identical ciphertext from packets which have identical data that
   spans the first block of the cipher algorithm's blocksize.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IV is XOR'd with the first plaintext block, before it is
   encrypted.  Then for successive blocks, the previous ciphertext block
   is XOR'd with the current plaintext, before it is encrypted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   More information on CBC mode can be obtained in [Schneier95].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2  Key Size</h3></a>

   Some cipher algorithms allow for variable sized keys, while others
   only allow a specific key size.  The length of the key correlates
   with the strength of that algorithm, thus larger keys are always
   harder to break than shorter ones.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document stipulates that all key sizes MUST be a multiple of 8
   bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document does specify the default key size for each cipher
   algorithm.  This size was chosen by consulting experts on the
   algorithm and by balancing strength of the algorithm with
   performance.
   +==============+==================+=================+==========+
   | Algorithm    | Key Sizes (bits) | Popular Sizes   | Default  |
   +==============+==================+=================+==========+
   | CAST-128 [1] | 40 to 128        | 40, 64, 80, 128 | 128      |<pre>
   +--------------+------------------+-----------------+----------+
   | RC5          | 40 to 2040       | 40, 128, 160    | 128      |
   +--------------+------------------+-----------------+----------+
   | IDEA         | 128              | 128             | 128      |
   +--------------+------------------+-----------------+----------+
   | Blowfish     | 40 to 448        | 128             | 128      |
   +--------------+------------------+-----------------+----------+
   | 3DES [2]     | 192              | 192             | 192      |
   +--------------+------------------+-----------------+----------+

   Notes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [1] With CAST-128, keys less than 128 bits MUST be padded with zeros
   in the rightmost, or least significant, positions out to 128 bits
   since the CAST-128 key schedule assumes an input key of 128 bits.
   Thus if you had a key with a size of 80 bits '3B5D831CFE', it would
   be padded to produce a key with a size of 128 bits
   '3B5D831CFE000000'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [2] The first 3DES key is taken from the first 64 bits, the second
   from the next 64 bits, and the third from the last 64 bits.
   Implementations MUST take into consideration the parity bits when
   initially accepting a new set of keys.  Each of the three keys is
   really 56 bits in length with the extra 8 bits used for parity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The reader should note that the minimum key size for all of the above
   cipher algorithms is 40 bits, and that the authors strongly advise
   that implementations do NOT use key sizes smaller than 40 bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3  Weak Keys</h3></a>

   Weak key checks SHOULD be performed.  If such a key is found, the key
   SHOULD be rejected and a new SA requested.  Some cipher algorithms
   have weak keys or keys that MUST not be used due to their weak
   nature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   New weak keys might be discovered, so this document does not in any
   way contain all possible weak keys for these ciphers.  Please check
   with other sources of cryptography such as [MOV] and [Schneier] for
   further weak keys.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CAST-128:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   No known weak keys.
   RC5:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   No known weak keys when used with 16 rounds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   IDEA:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IDEA has been found to have weak keys.  Please check with [MOV] and
   [Schneier] for more information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   Blowfish:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Weak keys for Blowfish have been discovered.  Weak keys are keys that
   produce the identical entries in a given S-box.  Unfortunately, there
   is no way to test for weak keys before the S- box values are
   generated.  However, the chances of randomly generating such a key
   are small.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   3DES:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DES has 64 known weak keys, including so-called semi-weak keys and
   possibly-weak keys [Schneier95, pp 280-282].  The likelihood of
   picking one at random is negligible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For DES-EDE3, there is no known need to reject weak or
   complementation keys.  Any weakness is obviated by the use of
   multiple keys.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, if the first two or last two independent 64-bit keys are
   equal (k1 == k2 or k2 == k3), then the 3DES operation is simply the
   same as DES.  Implementers MUST reject keys that exhibit this
   property.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4  Block Size and Padding</h3></a>

   All of the algorithms described in this document use a block size of
   eight octets (64 bits).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Padding is used to align the payload type and pad length octets as
   specified in [Kent98].  Padding must be sufficient to align the data
   to be encrypted to an eight octet (64 bit) boundary.
	<a name="section-2.5"><h3>2.5  Rounds</h3></a>

   This variable determines how many times a block is encrypted.  While
   this variable MAY be negotiated, a default value MUST always exist
   when it is not negotiated.

   The DES-EDE3-CBC algorithm is a simple variant of the DES-CBC
   algorithm [FIPS-46].  The "outer" chaining technique is used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In DES-EDE3-CBC, an Initialization Vector (IV) is XOR'd with the
   first 64-bit (8 byte) plaintext block (P1).  The keyed DES function
   is iterated three times, an encryption (Ek1) followed by a decryption
   (Dk2) followed by an encryption (Ek3), and generates the ciphertext
   (C1) for the block.  Each iteration uses an independent key: k1, k2
   and k3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For successive blocks, the previous ciphertext block is XOR'd with
   the current plaintext (Pi).  The keyed DES-EDE3 encryption function
   generates the ciphertext (Ci) for that block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To decrypt, the order of the functions is reversed: decrypt with k3,
   encrypt with k2, decrypt with k1, and XOR the previous ciphertext
   block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that when all three keys (k1, k2 and k3) are the same, DES-
   EDE3-CBC is equivalent to DES-CBC.  This property allows the DES-EDE3

   The IV field MUST be same size as the block size of the cipher
   algorithm being used.  The IV MUST be chosen at random.  Common
   practice is to use random data for the first IV and the last block of
   encrypted data from an encryption process as the IV for the next
   encryption process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Including the IV in each datagram ensures that decryption of each
   received datagram can be performed, even when some datagrams are
   dropped, or datagrams are re-ordered in transit.

   This document is a merger of most of the ESP cipher algorithm
   documents.  This merger was done to facilitate greater understanding
   of the commonality of all of the ESP algorithms and to further the
   development of these algorithm within ESP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The content of this document is based on suggestions originally from
   Stephen Kent and subsequent discussions from the IPSec mailing list
   as well as other IPSec documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Special thanks to Carlisle Adams and Paul Van Oorschot both of
   Entrust Technologies who provided input and review of CAST.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Thanks to all of the editors of the previous ESP 3DES documents; W.
   Simpson, N. Doraswamy, P. Metzger, and P. Karn.
