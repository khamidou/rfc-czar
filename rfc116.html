                     STRUCTURE OF THE MAY NWG MTG.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">In order to use our time in Atlantic City more effectively, I would
like to organize the meetings around discussions of advertised topics,
with published status reports and position papers.  I envision our
time being divided into three phases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Phase one is for status reports from each of the sites and for the
introductions of new sites or agencies.  Each existing site should
plan to report on its state of software and hardware development, and
on its use of the network.  New sites will introduce themselves and
present their plans for attachment to and use of the network.  In
addition, work on the ILLIAC IV, the List machine, and the terminal
IMP will be reviewed.  I will assume that each site needs 5-10 minutes
unless I am notified otherwise.  A short written status report is also
explected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Phase two is for discussion of current network-wide topics such as the
NIC, the Form Machine Telnet, and Logger Protocol.  Suggestions for
these topics should be made to me.  Committees should plan to prepare
these reports and discuss their work.  Points of view not represented
by existing committees should be explicated in position papers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Phase three is consideration of new topcs.  Som eof the topics I have
in mind are what the long range goals of the NWG should be, what
operational goals the NWG should set for the next six months, and
neither the NWG should have more or less structure.  Suggestions for
new topics are particularly encouraged, and these are best opened up
with an introductory position paper.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A major factor in the effiectiveness of this meeting will be the
written material available before the meeting.  As far as possible,
reports and position papers should be published in RFC form by 1 May 71.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The agenda will be composed from suggestions made to me; please call
me at (213) 825-2368.  I will publish an agenda and schedule of<br>
meetings about 1 May.
