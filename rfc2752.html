   This document describes the representation of identity information in
   POLICY_DATA object [POL-EXT] for supporting policy based admission
   control in RSVP. The goal of identity representation is to allow a
   process on a system to securely identify the owner and the
   application of the communicating process (e.g. user id) and convey
   this information in RSVP messages (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner.
   We describe the encoding of identities as RSVP policy element. We
   describe the processing rules to generate identity policy elements
   for multicast merged flows. Subsequently, we describe representations
   of user identities for Kerberos and Public Key based user
   authentication mechanisms. In summary we describe the use of this
   identity information in an operational setting.

	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Introduction</h2></a>

   RSVP [RFC 2205] is a resource reservation setup protocol designed for
   an integrated services Internet [RFC 1633]. RSVP is used by a host to
   request specific quality of service (QoS) from the network for
   particular application data streams or flows. RSVP is also used by
   routers to deliver QoS requests to all nodes along the path(s) of the
   flows and to establish and maintain state to provide the requested
   service. RSVP requests will generally result in resources being
   reserved in each node along the data path. RSVP allows particular
   users to obtain preferential access to network resources, under the
   control of an admission control mechanism. Permission to make a
   reservation is based both upon the availability of the requested
   resources along the path of the data and upon satisfaction of policy
   rules. Providing policy based admission control mechanism based on
   user identity or application is one of the prime requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to solve these problems and implement identity based policy
   control it is required to identify the user and/or application making
   a RSVP request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document proposes a mechanism for sending identification
   information in the RSVP messages and enables authorization decisions
   based on policy and identity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We describe the authentication policy element (AUTH_DATA) contained
   in the POLICY_DATA object. User process can generate an AUTH_DATA
   policy element and gives it to RSVP process (service) on the
   originating host. RSVP service inserts AUTH_DATA into the RSVP
   message to identify the owner (user and/or application) making the
   request for network resources. Network elements, such as routers,
   authenticate request using the credentials presented in the AUTH_DATA
   and admit the RSVP message based on admission policy. After a request
   has been authenticated, first hop router installs the RSVP state and
   forwards the new policy element returned by the Policy Decision Point
   (PDP) [POL-FRAME].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Policy Element for Authentication Data</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Policy Data Object Format</h3></a>

   POLICY_DATA objects contain policy information and are carried by
   RSVP messages. A detail description of the format of POLICY_DATA
   object can be found in "RSVP Extensions for Policy Control" [POL-
   EXT].
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Authentication Data Policy Element</h3></a>

   In this section, we describe a policy element (PE) called
   authentication data (AUTH_DATA). AUTH_DATA policy element contains a
   list of authentication attributes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><pre>       +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

   Length
       The length of the policy element (including the Length and P-
       Type) is in number of octets (MUST be a multiple of 4) and
       indicates the end of the authentication attribute list.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   P-Type (Identity Type)
       Type of identity information contained in this Policy Element
       supplied as the Policy element type (P-type). The Internet
       Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for policy
       element types for identity as described in the [POL-EXT].
       Initially, the registry contains the following P-Types for
       identity:

   Authentication Attribute List

       Authentication attributes contain information specific to
       authentication method and type of AUTH_DATA.  The policy element
       provides the mechanism for grouping a collection of
       authentication attributes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3  Authentication Attributes</h3></a>

   Authentication attributes MUST be encoded as a multiple of 4 octets,

   An RSVP enabled host is configured to construct and insert AUTH_DATA
   policy element into RSVP messages that designate use of the Kerberos
   authentication method (KERBEROS_TKT). Upon RSVP session
   initialization, the user application contacts the KDC to obtain a
   Kerberos ticket for the next network node or its PDP. A router when
   generating a RSVP message contacts the KDC to obtain a Kerberos
   ticket for the next hop network node or its PDP. The identity of the
   PDP or next network hop can be statically configured, learned via
   DHCP or maintained in a directory service. The Kerberos ticket is
   sent to the next network node (which may be a router or host) in a
   RSVP message. The KDC is used to validate the ticket and

     Figure 1: User and Application Authentication using AUTH_DATA PE

   Network nodes (hosts/routers) generate AUTH_DATA policy elements,
   contents of which are depend on the identity type used and the
   authentication method used. These generally contain authentication
   credentials (Kerberos ticket or digital certificate) and policy
   locators (which can be the X.500 Distinguished Name of the user or
   network node or application names). Network nodes generate AUTH_DATA
   policy element containing the authentication identity when making the
   RSVP request or forwarding a RSVP message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Network nodes generate user AUTH_DATA policy element using the
   following rules

   1. For unicast sessions the user policy locator is copied from the
      previous hop. The authentication credentials are for the current
      network node identity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. For multicast messages the user policy locator is for the current
      network node identity. The authentication credentials are for the
      current network node.
   Network nodes generate application AUTH_DATA policy element using the
   following rules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. For unicast sessions the application AUTH_DATA is copied from the
      previous hop.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. For multicast messages the application AUTH_DATA is either the
      first application AUTH_DATA in the message or chosen by the PDP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.  Message Processing Rules</h2></a>

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1  Message Generation (RSVP Host)</h3></a>

   An RSVP message is created as specified in [RFC2205] with following
   modifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. RSVP message MAY contain multiple AUTH_DATA policy elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Authentication policy element (AUTH_DATA) is created and the
      IdentityType field is set to indicate the identity type in the
      policy element.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  DN is inserted as POLICY_LOCATOR attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  Credentials such as Kerberos ticket or digital certificate are
         inserted as the CREDENTIAL attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. POLICY_DATA object (containing the AUTH_DATA policy element) is
      inserted in the RSVP message in appropriate place. If INTEGRITY
      object is not computed for the RSVP message then an INTEGRITY
      object SHOULD be computed for this POLICY_DATA object, as
      described in the [POL_EXT], and SHOULD be inserted as a Policy
      Data option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2  Message Reception (Router)</h3></a>

   RSVP message is processed as specified in [RFC2205] with following
   modifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. If router is not policy aware then it SHOULD send the RSVP message
      to the PDP and wait for response. If the router is policy unaware
      then it ignores the policy data objects and continues processing
      the RSVP message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Reject the message if the response from the PDP is negative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. Continue processing the RSVP message.
	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3  Authentication (Router/PDP)</h3></a>

   1. Retrieve the AUTH_DATA policy element. Check the PE type field and
      return an error if the identity type is not supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Verify user credential

      -  Simple authentication: e.g. Get user ID and validate it, or get
         executable name and validate it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  Kerberos: Send the Kerberos ticket to the KDC to obtain the
         session key. Using the session key authenticate the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  Public Key: Validate the certificate that it was issued by a
         trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and authenticate the user or
         application by verifying the digital signature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.  Error Signaling</h2></a>

   If PDP fails to verify the AUTH_DATA policy element then it MUST
   return policy control failure (Error Code = 02) to the PEP. The error
   values are described in [RFC 2205] and [POL-EXT]. Also PDP SHOULD
   supply a policy data object containing an AUTH_DATA Policy Element
   with A-Type=POLICY_ERROR_CODE containing more details on the Policy
   Control failure (see section 3.3.4). The PEP will include this Policy
   Data object in the outgoing RSVP Error message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.  IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS],
   authentication attribute types (A-Type)in the range 0-127 are
   allocated through an IETF Consensus action, A-Type values between
   128-255 are reserved for Private Use and are not assigned by IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS],
   POLICY_LOCATOR SubType values in the range 0-127 are allocated
   through an IETF Consensus action, POLICY_LOCATOR SubType values
   between 128-255 are reserved for Private Use and are not assigned by
   IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], CREDENTIAL
   SubType values in the range 0-127 are allocated through an IETF
   Consensus action, CREDENTIAL SubType values between 128-255 are
   reserved for Private Use and are not assigned by IANA.
	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The purpose of this memo is to describe a mechanism to authenticate
   RSVP requests based on user identity in a secure manner. RSVP
   INTEGRITY object is used to protect the policy object containing user
   identity information from security (replay) attacks. Combining the
   AUTH_DATA policy element and the INTEGRITY object results in a secure
   access control that enforces authentication based on both the
   identity of the user and the identity of the originating node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Simple authentication does not contain credential that can be
   securely authenticated and is inherently less secured.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Kerberos authentication mechanism is reasonably well secured.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   User authentication using a public key certificate is known to
   provide the strongest security.
