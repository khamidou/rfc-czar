   This document defines a content feature schema that is a profile of
   the media feature registration mechanisms [1,2,3] for use in
   performing capability identification between extended Internet fax
   systems [5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document does not describe any specific mechanisms for
   communicating capability information, but does presume that any such
   mechanisms will transfer textual values.  It specifies a textual
   format to be used for describing Internet fax capability information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The range of capabilities that can be indicated are based on those
   covered by the TIFF file format for Internet fax [7] and Group 3
   facsimile [6].  A companion document [4] describes the relationship
   and mapping between this schema and Group 3 fax capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1  Organization of this document</h3></a>

   Section 2 specifies the overall syntax for fax feature descriptions
   by reference to the media feature registration and syntax documents
   [1,2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 3 enumerates the feature tags that are to be recognized and
   processed by extended Internet fax systems, according to their
   capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Appendix A contains additional feature tag registrations for media
   features that are specific to fax and for which no applicable
   registration already exists.  These are presented in the form
   prescribed by the media feature registration procedure [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2  Terminology and document conventions</h3></a>

   The term "extended Internet fax system" is used to describe any
   software, device or combination of these that conforms to the
   specification "Extended Facsimile Using Internet Mail" [5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "capability exchange" describes any transfer of information between
   communicating systems that is used to indicate system capabilities
   and hence determine the form of data transferred.  This term covers
   both one-way and two-way transfers of capability information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "capability identification" is a particular form of capability
   exchange in which a receiving system provides capability information
   to a sending system.
   "capability description" is a collection of data presented in some
   specific format that describes the capabilities of some communicating
   entity.  It may exist separately from any specific capability
   exchange mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NOTE: Comments like this provide additional nonessential
      information about the rationale behind this document.  Such
      information is not needed for building a conformant
      implementation, but may help those who wish to understand the
      design in greater depth.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Fax feature schema syntax</h2></a>

   The syntax for the fax feature schema is described by "A syntax for
   describing media feature sets" [2].  This in turn calls upon media
   feature tags that may be registered according to the procedure
   described in "Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure" [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NOTE: Media feature registration provides a base vocabulary of
      features that correspond to media handling capabilities.  The
      feature set syntax provides a mechanism and format for combining
      these to describe combinations of features.  This memo indicates
      those features that may be associated with extended Internet fax
      systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Internet fax feature tags</h2></a>

   This section enumerates and briefly describes a number of feature
   tags that are defined for use with extended Internet fax systems and
   applications.  These tags may be used also by other systems and
   applications that support corresponding capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The feature tags presented below are those that an extended Internet
   fax system is expected to recognize its ability or non-ability to
   handle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Definitive descriptions of feature tags are indicated by reference to
   their registration per the media feature registration procedure [1]
   (some of which are appended to this document)

      NOTE: The presence of a feature tag in this list does not mean
      that an extended Internet fax system must have that capability;
      rather, it must recognize the feature tag and deal with it
      according to the capabilities that it does have.
      Further, an extended Internet fax system is not prevented from
      recognizing and offering additional feature tags.  The list below
      is intended to provide a basic vocabulary that all extended
      Internet fax systems can use in a consistent fashion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If an unrecognized or unused feature tag is received, the feature
      set matching rule (described in RFC2533 [2]) operates so that tag
      is effectively ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Image size</h3></a>

      Feature tag name    Legal values
      ----------------    ------------
      size-x              <Rational> (>0)
      size-y              <Rational> (>0)

   Reference:  this document, Appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These feature values indicate a rendered document size in inches.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Where the actual size is measured in millimetres, a conversion
   factor of 10/254 may be applied to yield an exact inch-based value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Resolution</h3></a>

      Feature tag name    Legal values
      ----------------    ------------
      dpi                 <Integer> (>0)
      dpi-xyratio         <Rational> (>0)

   Reference: "Media Features for Display, Print, and Fax" [3], and this
   document appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If 'dpi-xyratio' is present and not equal to 1 then the horizontal
   resolution (x-axis) is indicated by the 'dpi' feature value, and the
   vertical resolution (y-axis) is the value of 'dpi' divided by 'dpi-
   xyratio'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, the basic Group 3 fax resolution of 200*100dpi might be
   indicated as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100) )

   When describing resolutions for an MRC format document, the complete
   set of usable resolutions is listed.  However, there are some
   restrictions on their use: (a) 100dpi resolution can be used only
   with multi-level images, and (b) any multi-level image resolution is
   required to be an integral sub-multiple of the applicable mask
   resolution.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NOTE: Where the recipient indicates specific support for hard copy
      or soft copy media type, a sender of color image data may wish to
      adjust the color components (e.g.  per the related rules of ITU
      recommendation T.42 [9]) to improve rendered image quality on that
      medium.

                       Full    (full continuous-tone color)


   Reference: "Media Features for Display, Print, and Fax" [3].
   The intention here is to give a broad indication of color handling
   capabilities that might be used, for example, to select among a small
   number of available data resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The value of this feature also gives an indication of the more
   detailed color handling features that might be applicable (see next
   section).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'Binary' indicates black-and-white, or other bi-level capability.  No
   further qualifying feature tags are required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'Limited' indicates a small number of distinct fixed colors, such as
   might be provided by a highlight printer, pen plotter or limited
   color display.  The 'color-levels' tag should be used to indicate the
   number of distinct colors available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NOTE: No ability to indicate any specific or named color is
      implied by this option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some devices might use different intensity levels rather than
   different hues for distinction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'Mapped' indicates that pixel color values are mapped in some
   specifiable way to a multi-component color space.  The 'color-levels'
   tag may be used to indicate the number of distinct colors available;
   in its absence, sufficient levels to display a photographic image
   should be assumed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'Grey' indicates a continuous tone grey-scale capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'Full' indicates full continuous tone color capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For 'Mapped', 'Grey' and 'Full' color, additional feature tags
   (section 3.6) may be used to further qualify the color reproduction.

   Reference: this document, appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The general model for image handling (both color and non-color) is
   described here from a receiver's perspective; a similar model
   operates in the reverse direction for a scan/send perspective:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          raw bit        pixel         color         physical
          stream  -(A)-> values -(B)-> values -(C)-> rendition

      -   "raw bit stream" is a stream of coded bits

     (A)  indicates image coding/decoding (MH,MR,MMR,JPEG,JBIG,etc.)

      -   "pixel values" are a single numeric value per picture element
          that designates the color of that element.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     (B)  indicates pixel-to-color value mapping

      -   "color values" have a separate numeric value for each color
          component (i.e. L*, a*, b* in the case of CIELAB indicated
          above.)

     (C)  indicates how the color values are related to a physical
          color.  This involves interpretation of the color value with
          respect to a color model (e.g. RGB, L*a*b*, CMY, CMYK) and a
          color space (which is typically recipient-dependent).
      -   "physical rendition" is a color value physically realized on a
          display, printer or other device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are many variables that can be applied at each stage of the
   processing of a color image, and any may be critical to meaningful
   handling of that image in some circumstances.  In other circumstances
   many of the variables may be implied (to some level of approximation)
   in the application that uses them (e.g. color images published on a
   Web page).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The color feature framework described here is intended to allow
   capability description at a range of granularity: feature tags which
   correspond to implied (or "don't care" or "unknown") feature values
   may simply be omitted from a capability description.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Grey scale and bi-level images are handled within this framework as a
   special case, having a 1-component color model.  The following
   features are used for describing color capabilities:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'color-levels' indicates the number of distinct values for each
   picture element, and applies to all but bi-level images.  For bi-
   level images, a value of 2 is implied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'color-space' is used mainly with 'Mapped' and 'Full', but could be
   used with other modes if the exact color used is significant.  Two
   kinds of color space can be distinguished: device-dependent and
   calibrated.  Device dependent spaces are named here as 'Device-xxx',
   and are used to indicate a color space that is defined by the
   receiving device.  Calibrated color spaces presume the existence of a
   rendering system that is calibrated with respect to an indicated
   definition, and is capable of processing the device-independent color
   information accordingly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A color-handling receiver should indicate any appropriate device
   color space capability in addition to any calibrated color spaces
   that it may support.  A calibrated color space should be used when
   precise color matching is required in the absence of specific
   knowledge of the receiving system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NOTE: In practice, although they appear to be separate concepts,
      the color model and color space cannot be separated.  In the final
      analysis, a color model (RGB, CMY, etc.) must be defined with
      respect to some color space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'CIELAB-L-depth', 'CIELAB-a-depth' and 'CIELAB-b-depth' indicate the
   number of different values that are possible for the L*, a* and b*
   color components respectively, and are significant only when colors
   are represented in a CIELAB color space.  These features would be
   used with palettized color, or with full color where each color
   component has a different number of possible values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The 'CIELAB-x-min' and 'CIELAB-x-max' values indicate a color gamut
   (i.e. a range of color values that are used or may be rendered).  A
   gamut may be indicated in terms of the CIELAB color space even when
   colors are represented in some other space.

	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6  Sender and receiver feature matching</h3></a>

   This example considers sending a document to a high-end black-and-
   white fax system with the following receiver capabilities:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (& (| (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100) )    -- 200*100
            (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=1) )          -- 200*200
            (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1) )          -- 300*300
            (& (dpi=400) (dpi-xyratio=1) ) )        -- 400*400
         (color=Binary)
         (| (& (paper-size=A4) (ua-media=[stationery,transparency]) )
            (& (paper-size=B4) (ua-media=continuous) ) )
         (image-coding=[MH,MR,JBIG]) )

   Turning to the document itself, assume it is available to the sender
   in three possible formats, A4 high resolution, B4 low resolution and
   A4 high resolution color, described by:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)
         (color=Binary)
         (paper-size=A4)
         (image-coding=[MMR,JBIG]) )

      (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100)
         (color=Binary)
         (paper-size=B4)
         (image-coding=[MH,MR]) )

      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)
         (color=Mapped) (color-levels<=256)
         (paper-size=A4)
         (image-coding=JPEG) )

   These three image formats can be combined into a composite capability
   statement by a logical-OR operation (to describe format-1 OR format-2
   OR format-3):
      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)
         (color=Binary)
         (paper-size=A4)
         (image-coding=[MMR,JBIG]) )
      (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100)
         (color=Binary)
         (paper-size=B4)
         (image-coding=[MH,MR]) )
      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)
         (color=Mapped) (color-levels=42)
         (paper-size=A4)
         (image-coding=JPEG) ) )

   This could be simplified, but there is little gain in doing so at
   this point.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The composite document description can be matched with the receiver
   capability description, according to the rules in [2], to yield the
   result:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)
         (color=Binary)
         (paper-size=A4)
         (ua-media=[stationery,transparency])
         (image-coding=JBIG) )
      (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100)
         (color=Binary)
         (paper-size=B4)
         (ua-media=continuous)
         (image-coding=[MH,MR]) ) )

   Points to note about the feature matching process:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The color document option is eliminated because the receiver
      cannot handle either color (indicated by '(color=Mapped)') or JPEG
      coding (indicated by '(image-coding=JPEG)').

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The high resolution version of the document with '(dpi=300)' must
      be send using '(image-coding=JBIG)' because this is the only
      available coding of the image data that the receiver can use for
      high resolution documents.  (The available 300dpi document codings
      here are MMR and JBIG, and the receiver capabilities are MH, MR
      and JBIG.)

   o  The low-resolution version of the document can be sent with either
      MH or MR coding as the receiver can deal with either of these for
      low resolution documents.
   o  The high resolution variant of the document is available only for
      A4, so that is the paper-size used in that case.  Similarly the
      low resolution version is sent for B4 paper.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Even though the sender may not understand the 'ua-media' feature
      tag, and does not mention it, the matching rules preserve the
      constraint that the B4 document is rendered with '(ua-
      media=continuous)', and the A4 document may be rendered with '
      (ua-media=[stationery,transparency])'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, note that when matching an MRC document description, the
   description of each component sub-image must match the capabilities
   of the intended receiver.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.  IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   Appendix A of this document calls for registrations of feature tags
   in the "IETF tree", as defined in section 3.1.1 of "Media Feature Tag
   Registration Procedure" [1] (i.e. these feature tags are subject to
   the "IETF Consensus" policies described in RFC 2434 [21]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ASN.1 identifiers should be assigned for each of these registered
   feature tags and replaced in the body of the registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The points raised below are in addition to the general security
   considerations for extended Internet fax [5], and others discussed in
   [2,8,11,12,13]

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1  Capability descriptions and mechanisms</h3></a>

   Negotiation mechanisms reveal information about one party to other
   parties.  This may raise privacy concerns, and may allow a malicious
   party to make better guesses about the presence of specific security
   holes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Most of these concerns pertain to capability information getting into
   the hands of someone who may abuse it.  This document specifies
   capabilities that help a sender to determine what image
   characteristics can be processed by the recipient, not mechanisms for
   their publication.  Implementors and users should take care that the
   mechanisms employed ensure that capabilities are revealed only to
   appropriate persons, systems and agents.
	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2  Specific threats</h3></a>

   1.  Unsolicited bulk mail:  if it is known that a recipient can
       process certain types of images, they may be targeted by bulk
       mailers that want to send such images.

         1.3.6.1.8.1.8

   -  Summary of the media features indicated:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         These feature tags indicate the size of a displayed, printed or
         otherwise rendered document image;  they indicate horizontal
         (size-x) and vertical (size-y) dimensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The unit of measure is inches (to be consistent with the
         measure of resolution defined by the feature tag 'dpi').

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Where the actual size is available in millimetres, a conversion
         factor of 10/254 may be applied to yield an exact inch-based
         value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Values appropriate for use with these feature tags:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Rational (>0)

   -  The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
      applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Print and display applications where different media choices
         will be made depending on the size of the recipient device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Examples of typical use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         This example describes the maximum scanned image width and
         height for Group 3 fax: 215x297 mm (8.46x11.69 inches):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (size-x<=2150/254)
         (size-y<=2970/254)
   -  Related standards or documents:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The memo "Media Features for Display, Print, and Fax" [3]
         describes features (pix-x, pix-y) for measuring document size
         in pixels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Fax applications should declare physical dimensions using the
         features defined here.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
      protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Where no physical size is known or available, but a pixel size
         is known, a notional size should be declared based upon known
         pixel dimensions and a notional resolution of (say) 100dpi

         For example, to describe a 640x480 pixel display:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            (& (size-x<=640/100) (size-y<=480/100) (dpi=100) )

         The notional 100dpi resolution is used as it represents a
         fairly typical resolution for a pixel-limited display.
         Reducing the rational numbers to canonical form gives the
         following equivalent expression:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            (& (size-x<=32/5) (size-y<=24/5) (dpi=100) )

   -  Interoperability considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For interoperability with other (non-fax) applications that use
         only pixel-based measurements, pixel dimensions (pix-x, pix-y)
         may be declared in addition to physical measurements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         When this feature tag is specified, any declared resolution
         (dpi) is presumed to apply to the horizontal axis, and the
         vertical resolution is obtained by dividing that declared
         resolution by the resolution ratio.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         When interoperating with an application that does not recognize
         the differential resolution feature, resolution matching may be
         performed on the basis of the horizontal resolution only, so
         aspect ratio information may be lost.

Appendix B: TIFF mode descriptions

   This appendix contains descriptions of the TIFF modes defined by RFC
   2301 [7], presented as feature set expressions in the form defined by
   "A syntax for describing media feature sets" [2] and using the
   feature schema introduced by this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These may be taken as illustrations of the feature set combinations
   that are required for the corresponding TIFF profiles described by
   RFC 2301.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (Tiff-S) :-
           (& (image-file-structure=TIFF-S)
              (color=Binary)
              (image-coding=MH) (MRC-mode=0) )

      (Tiff-F) :-
           (& (image-file-structure=TIFF-F)
              (color=Binary)
              (image-coding=MH) (MRC-mode=0) )

      (TIFF-J) :-
           (& (image-file-structure=TIFF-J)
              (color=Binary)
              (image-coding=JBIG) (MRC-mode=0) )

      (TIFF-C) :-
           (& (image-file-structure=TIFF-C)
              (color=Grey)
              (image-coding=JPEG) (MRC-mode=0) )

      (TIFF-L) :-
           (& (image-file-structure=TIFF-L)
              (color=Grey)
              (image-coding=JBIG) (MRC-mode=0) )

      (TIFF-M) :-
           (& (image-file-structure=TIFF-M)
              (color=[Binary,Grey])
              (image-coding=[MH,JPEG]) (MRC-mode>=1) )

   The feature sets described above are minimum requirements for the
   corresponding TIFF modes.  Thus, MR and MMR image coding are not
   mandatory with TIFF mode F, and would be indicated by combining the
   expression for (TIFF-F) with (image-coding=MR) and/or (image-
   coding=MMR).
   Similarly, limited, mapped or full color are not mandatory with the
   grey/color TIFF modes (C, L and M), and would be indicated by
   combining the corresponding expression with (color=limited),
   (color=mapped) and/or (color=full).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TIFF profile M is a composite structure that can combine image data
   coding options from other profiles: the description above indicates
   mandatory features; other options may be indicated by combining
   TIFF-M with other options (e.g. color= limited, mapped or full, and
   image-coding= MR, MMR or JBIG).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Support for multiple TIFF profiles may be indicated by combining
   their expressions with the OR operator; e.g.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        (| (TIFF-F) (TIFF-S) (TIFF-J) )

   indicates support for all black-and-white modes.
