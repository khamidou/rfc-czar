               Availability of MIX and MIXAL in the Network

   In RFC 473 I requested information on the existence of assemblers and
   interpreters for Knuth's hypothetical MIX computer.  Following is a
   summary of the responses to my earlier RFC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   First the rumors: (1) There is rumored to be a MIX interpreter<br>
   available on the University of Utah PDP-10, but not assembler; and
   (2) There is rumored to be a MIX interpreter available on the SU-AI<br>
   PDP-10.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Now the facts:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A fairly well debugged and documented MIXAL assembler exists for the
   UCSB 360/75.  A partially debugged MIX interpreter also exists.  See
   RFC 485 for additional information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Box MIX and MIXAL are available on the UCSD B6700; although,
   according to Ken Bowles, they are not currently being handled as
   fully supported products, and there may be some remaining bugs in the
   systems. However, MIX and MIXAL are available for network users, and
   Ken says they will be happy to receive notification of any errors
   found in the MIX and MIXAL and will attempt to get corrections made
   in due course. Contact Ken Bowles at UCSD for further information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MIX and an assembler for MIX are available for network use on the
   UCLA 360/91.  These systems have had considerable use, and they are
   documented.  Contact Bob Braden at CCN for further information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally: The Computer Science Center at Stanford University
   apparently has available a standard package for exporting the MIX
   systems to 360s and 370s.
