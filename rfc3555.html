   This document defines the procedure to register RTP Payload Formats
   as audio, video or other MIME subtype names.  This is useful in a
   text-based format or control protocol to identify the type of an RTP
   transmission.  This document also registers all the RTP payload
   formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences as
   MIME subtypes.  Some of these may also be used for transfer modes
   other than RTP.

   The MIME registration procedure described in RFC 2048 [1] was
   originally designed for transport of multimedia information via
   asynchronous Internet mail, but the MIME namespace now provides
   identification for other transport modes as well.  This document
   defines the procedure to register MIME subtype names for use with the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), RFC 3550 [2], to identify RTP
   payload formats.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in
   the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [3], as
   MIME subtypes under the "audio" and "video" MIME types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1  IANA Considerations</h3></a>

   This document registers the following MIME subtypes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      audio/DVI4
      audio/G722
      audio/G723
      audio/G726-16

      audio/G726-40
      audio/G728

      video/MP1S
      video/MP2P
      video/BMPEG
      video/nv

   MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for
   transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here
   and augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2  Terminology</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4] and
   indicate requirement levels for implementations compliant with this
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Procedure For Registering MIME Types for RTP Payload Types</h2></a>

   Registering an RTP payload type as a MIME type follows the same
   procedures as described in RFC 2048 and uses the registration
   template shown in Section 2.8 of RFC 2048.  Some additional
   parameters are required to specify how a particular payload format is
   transported over RTP:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Published specification
         A description of the encoding and a specification of the
         payload format must be provided, usually by reference to an RTP
         payload format specification RFC.  That RFC may be separate, or
         the MIME subtype registration may be incorporated into the
         payload format specification RFC.  The payload format
         specification MUST include the RTP timestamp clock rate (or
         multiple rates for audio encodings with multiple sampling
         rates).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A reference to a further description of the data compression
         format itself should be provided, if available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Required parameters
         If the payload format does not have a fixed RTP timestamp clock
         rate, then a "rate" parameter is required to specify the RTP
         timestamp clock rate.  A particular payload format may have
         additional required parameters.
      Optional parameters
         Most audio payload formats can have an optional "channels"
         parameter to specify the number of audio channels included in
         the transmission.  Any payload format, but most likely audio
         formats, may also include the optional parameters "ptime", to
         specify the recommended length of time in milliseconds
         represented by the media in a packet, and/or "maxptime" to
         specify the maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated
         in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The "ptime"
         and "maxptime" parameters are defined in the Session
         Description Protocol (SDP) [5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A particular payload format may have additional optional
         parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Encoding considerations
         The fact that the type can be transferred via RTP MUST be
         noted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Depending on whether the type has already been registered for
   transfer with a non-RTP protocol (e.g. MIME mail or http) or not,
   several different cases can occur:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      a) Not yet registered as a MIME type

         A new registration should be constructed using the MIME
         registration template.  The registration may specify transfer
         via other means in addition to RTP if that is feasible and
         desired.  The encoding considerations must specify how the type
         is transferred via RTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Optional parameters may be defined as needed, and it must be
         clearly stated whether to which mode(s) of transfer the
         parameters apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      b) MIME type exists for a non-RTP protocol

         The encoding considerations of the existing type should be
         changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via
         RTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         RTP-specific parameters may be added, and it must be clearly
         stated that these are only to be used when the media type is
         transmitted via RTP transport.
      c) Update an existing MIME type for RTP to be used for a non-RTP
         protocol

         The encoding considerations of the existing type should be
         changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via a
         non-RTP protocol (e.g. SMTP, HTTP).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Non-RTP-specific parameters can be added, and it must be
         clearly stated that these are only to be used when the media
         type is transmitted via a non-RTP transport.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Mapping to SDP Parameters</h2></a>

   The representation of a MIME media type is specified in the syntax of
   the Content-Type header field in RFC 2045 [6] as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      type "/" subtype  *(";" parameter)

   Parameters may be required for a particular type or subtype or they
   may be optional.  For media types which represent RTP payload
   formats, the parameters "rate", "channels", "ptime", and "maxptime"
   have general definitions (given above) that may apply across types
   and subtypes.  The format for a parameter is specified in RFC 2045 as

      attribute "=" value

   where attribute is the parameter name and the permissible values are
   specified for each parameter.  The value may need to be a quoted
   string if it contains any of the special characters listed in RFC
   2045.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The information carried in the media type string has a specific
   mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5],
   which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  The mapping is as
   follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The MIME type (e.g., audio) goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The MIME subtype (payload format) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
         encoding name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The general (possibly optional) parameters "rate" and
         "channels" also go in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate and encoding
         parameters, respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The general (and optional) parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go
         in the SDP "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.
      o  Any payload-format-specific parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp"
         attribute.  The set of allowed parameters is defined by the RFC
         that specifies the payload format and MUST NOT be extended by
         the MIME subtype registration without a corresponding revision
         of the payload format specification.  The format and syntax of
         these parameters may also be defined by the payload format
         specification, but it is suggested that the parameters be
         copied directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon
         separated list of parameter=value pairs.  For payload formats
         that specify some other syntax for the fmtp parameters, the
         registration of that payload format as a MIME subtype must
         specify what the parameters are in MIME format and how to map
         them to the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.  See Section 4.1.21 for an
         example.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example mapping is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      audio/L16; rate=48000; channels=2; ptime=5; emphasis=50-15

      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 L16/48000/2
      a=fmtp:97 emphasis=50-15
      a=ptime:5

   Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in the RTP
   Profile are commonly shown in upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly
   shown in lower case.  These names are case-insensitive in both
   places.  Similarly, parameter names are case-insensitive both in MIME
   types and in the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.  Registrations for "Audio/Video Profile"</h2></a>

   In the following sections, all RTP payload formats described in the
   RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [3], are

   MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for
   transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here
   and augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: L16

   Required parameters
        rate: number of samples per second -- For non-RTP transport,

        transport, other values are permissible but the aforementioned
        values are RECOMMENDED.  For RTP, the rate parameter indicates
        the RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sample
        rate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Optional parameters
        channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults

        between individual two-byte samples.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        emphasis: analog preemphasis applied to the signal before

        emphasis=50-15 to indicate the 50/15 microsecond preemphasis
        used with Compact Disks.  This parameter MUST be omitted if no
        analog preemphasis was applied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        channel-order: specifies the sample interleaving order for

   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: RED

   Required parameters:
        pt: a comma-separated list of RTP payload types.  Because
        comma is a special character, the list must be a quoted-string
        (enclosed in double quotes).  For static payload types, each
        list element is simply the type number.  For dynamic payload
        types, each list element is a mapping of the dynamic payload
        type number to an embedded MIME content-type specification for
        the payload format corresponding to the dynamic payload type.
        The format of the mapping is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           dynamic-payload-type "=" content-type

        If the content-type string includes a comma, then the
        content-type string MUST be a quoted-string.  If the content-
        type string does not include a comma, it MAY still be quoted.
        Since it is part of the list which must itself be a quoted-
        string, that means the quotation marks MUST be quoted with
        backslash quoting as specified in RFC 2045.  If the content-
        type string itself contains a quoted-string, then the
        requirement for backslash quoting is recursively applied.  To
        specify the audio/RED payload format in SDP, the pt parameter
        is mapped to an a=fmtp attribute by eliminating the parameter
        name (pt) and changing the commas to slashes.  For example,
        'pt="0,5"' maps to 'a=fmtp:99 0/5'.  A more complicated
        example, with a dynamic payload type, is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           pt = "0, 103 = \"audio/G729D;annexb=yes\" "

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The MIME subtype registration procedure specified in this memo does
   not impose any security considerations on its own.  This memo also
   contains several MIME type registrations.  The registrations
   themselves do not impose security risks, but some may state security
   considerations specific to the particular registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Several audio and video encodings are perfect for hiding data using
   steganography.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RTP specification, RFC 3550, provides security considerations for
   the transport of audio and video data over RTP, including the use of
   encryption where confidentiality is required.
