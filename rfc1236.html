                  IP to X.121 Address Mapping for DDN</h1>
                  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

   This memo defines a standard way of converting IP addresses to CCITT
   X.121 addresses and is the recommended standard for use on the
   Internet, specifically for the Defense Data Network (DDN).  This memo
   provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify
   an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Overview</h2></a>

   The Defense Communication Agency (DCA) has stated that "DDN specifies
   a standard for mapping Class A addresses to X.121 addresses."
   Additionally DCA has stated that Class B and C IP to X.121 address
   mapping "standards are the responsibility of the administration of
   the Class B or C network in question".  Therefore, there is NO
   defined single standard way of converting Class B and Class C IP
   addresses to X.121 addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is an important issue because currently there is no way for
   administrators to define IP to X.121 address mapping.  Without a
   single standard, in a multi-vendor network environment, there is no
   assurance that devices using IP and DDN X.25 will communicate with
   each other.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IP to X.121 address mapping of Class B and Class C IP addresses
   shall be implemented as described below.  This translation method is
   a direct expansion of the algorithm described in the "MIL-STD:  X.25,
   DDN X.25 Host Interface Specification" [1].  The translation method
   described below is TOTALLY independent of IP subnetting and of any
   masking that may be used in support of IP subnetting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Background</h2></a>

   All Internet hosts are assigned a four octet (32 bit) address
   composed of a network field and a local address field also known as
   the REST field [2] (see Figure 1 thru 3).  Two basic forms of
   addresses are provided:  (1) Physical addresses, correspond to the<br>
   node number and DCE port number of the node to which the DTE is
   connected.  (2) Logical addresses, are mapped transparently by DCE<br>
   software into a corresponding physical network address.
   To provide flexibility, Internet addresses are divided into 3 primary
   classes:  Class A, Class B, and Class C.  These classes allow for a
   large number of small and medium sized networks.  The network
   addresses used within the Internet in Class A, B, and C networks are
   divided between Research, Defense, Government, (Non-Defense) and
   Commercial uses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As described in the MIL-STD:  X25, an IP address consists of the
   ASCII text string representation of four decimal numbers separated by
   periods, corresponding to the four octets of a thirty-two bit
   Internet address.  The four decimal numbers are referred to in this
   memo as network (n), host (h), logical address (l), and Interface
   Message Processor (IMP) or Packet Switch Node (PSN) (i).  Thus, an
   Internet address maybe represented as "n.h.l.i" (Class A), "n.n.h.i"
   (Class B), or "n.n.n.hi" (Class C), depending on the Internet address
   class.  Each of these four numbers will have either one, two, or
   three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.
   For example, in the Class A IP address "26.9.0.122", n=26 h=9, l=0,
   and i=122.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The different classes of Internet addresses [3] are illustrated
   below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Class A:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The highest-order bit is set to 0.
   7-bits define the network number.
   24-bits define the local address.
   This allows  up to 126 class A networks.
   Networks 0 and 127 are reserved.

   Class B:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The two highest-order bits are set to 1-0.
   14-bits define the network number.
   16-bits define the local address.
   This allows up to 16,384 class B networks.

   Class C:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The three highest-order bits are set to 1-1-0.
   21-bits define the network number.
   8-bits define the local address.
   This allows up to 2,097,152 class C networks

                                   Figure 3

   The fourth type of address, class D, is used as a multicast address.
   The four highest-order bits are set to 1-1-1-0.  Note:  No addresses
   are allowed with the four highest-order bits set to 1-1-1-1.  These
   addresses, called "class E", are reserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "MIL-STD:  X.25" states "All DDN addresses are either twelve or
   fourteen BCD (binary-coded decimal) digits in length.".  The last two
   digits are referred to as the Sub-Address and are not used on the
   DDN.  The Sub-Address is carried across the network without
   modification.  Its presence is optional.  Therefore, a DTE may
   generate EITHER a twelve or fourteen BCD X.121 address, but must
   accept both twelve and fourteen BCD X.121 addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Standard IP to X.121 Address Mapping</h2></a>

   This section describes the algorithm that should be used to convert
   IP addresses to X.121 addresses [1].  You will note that "h" is
   always listed as greater than or less than the number 64.  This
   number is used to differentiate between PSN physical and logical host
   port addresses.  Note that at the time of this writing, the DDN does
   not make use of the PSN's logical addressing feature, which allows
   hosts to be addressed independently of their physical point of
   attachment to the network.
