	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Kerberos V5 protocol [RFC4120] involves use of a trusted third
   party known as the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to negotiate shared
   session keys between clients and services and provide mutual
   authentication between them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The corner-stones of Kerberos V5 are the Ticket and the
   Authenticator.  A Ticket encapsulates a symmetric key (the ticket
   session key) in an envelope (a public message) intended for a
   specific service.  The contents of the Ticket are encrypted with a
   symmetric key shared between the service principal and the issuing
   KDC.  The encrypted part of the Ticket contains the client principal
   name, among other items.  An Authenticator is a record that can be
   shown to have been recently generated using the ticket session key in
   the associated Ticket.  The ticket session key is known by the client
   who requested the ticket.  The contents of the Authenticator are
   encrypted with the associated ticket session key.  The encrypted part
   of an Authenticator contains a timestamp and the client principal
   name, among other items.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As shown in Figure 1, below, the Kerberos V5 protocol consists of the
   following message exchanges between the client and the KDC, and the
   client and the application service:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    - The Authentication Service (AS) Exchange

      The client obtains an "initial" ticket from the Kerberos
      authentication server (AS), typically a Ticket Granting Ticket
      (TGT).  The AS-REQ message and the AS-REP message are the request
      and the reply message, respectively, between the client and the
      AS.
    - The Ticket Granting Service (TGS) Exchange

      The client subsequently uses the TGT to authenticate and request a
      service ticket for a particular service, from the Kerberos
      ticket-granting server (TGS).  The TGS-REQ message and the TGS-REP
      message are the request and the reply message respectively between
      the client and the TGS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    - The Client/Server Authentication Protocol (AP) Exchange

      The client then makes a request with an AP-REQ message, consisting
      of a service ticket and an authenticator that certifies the
      client's possession of the ticket session key.  The server may
      optionally reply with an AP-REP message.  AP exchanges typically
      negotiate session-specific symmetric keys.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Usually, the AS and TGS are integrated in a single device also known
   as the KDC.

       Figure 1:  The Message Exchanges in the Kerberos V5 Protocol

   In the AS exchange, the KDC reply contains the ticket session key,
   among other items, that is encrypted using a key (the AS reply key)
   shared between the client and the KDC.  The AS reply key is typically
   derived from the client's password for human users.  Therefore, for
   human users, the attack resistance strength of the Kerberos protocol
   is no stronger than the strength of their passwords.
   The use of asymmetric cryptography in the form of X.509 certificates
   [RFC3280] is popular for facilitating data origin authentication and
   perfect secrecy.  An established Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   provides key management and key distribution mechanisms that can be
   used to establish authentication and secure communication.  Adding
   public-key cryptography to Kerberos provides a nice congruence to
   public-key protocols, obviates the human users' burden to manage
   strong passwords, and allows Kerberized applications to take
   advantage of existing key services and identity management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The advantage afforded by the Kerberos TGT is that the client exposes
   his long-term secrets only once.  The TGT and its associated session
   key can then be used for any subsequent service ticket requests.  One
   result of this is that all further authentication is independent of
   the method by which the initial authentication was performed.
   Consequently, initial authentication provides a convenient place to
   integrate public-key cryptography into Kerberos authentication.  In
   addition, the use of symmetric cryptography after the initial
   exchange is preferred for performance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes the methods and data formats using which the
   client and the KDC can use public and private key pairs to mutually
   authenticate in the AS exchange and negotiate the AS reply key, known
   only by the client and the KDC, to encrypt the AS-REP sent by the
   KDC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this protocol, both the client and the KDC have a public-private
   key pair in order to prove their identities to each other over the
   open network.  The term "signature key" is used to refer to the
   private key of the key pair being used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encryption key used to encrypt the enc-part field of the KDC-REP
   in the AS-REP [RFC4120] is referred to as the AS reply key.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An empty sequence in an optional field can be either included or
   omitted: both encodings are permitted and considered equivalent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The term "Modular Exponential Diffie-Hellman" is used to refer to the
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange, as described in [RFC2631], in order to
   differentiate it from other equivalent representations of the same
   key agreement algorithm.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Extensions</h2></a>

   This section describes extensions to [RFC4120] for supporting the use
   of public-key cryptography in the initial request for a ticket.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Briefly, this document defines the following extensions to [RFC4120]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. The client indicates the use of public-key authentication by
      including a special preauthenticator in the initial request.  This
      preauthenticator contains the client's public-key data and a
      signature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. The KDC tests the client's request against its authentication
      policy and trusted Certification Authorities (CAs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. If the request passes the verification tests, the KDC replies as
      usual, but the reply is encrypted using either:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      a. a key generated through a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange
         [RFC2631] [IEEE1363] with the client, signed using the KDC's
         signature key; or

      b. a symmetric encryption key, signed using the KDC's signature
         key and encrypted using the client's public key.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Any keying material required by the client to obtain the
      encryption key for decrypting the KDC reply is returned in a pre-
      authentication field accompanying the usual reply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4. The client validates the KDC's signature, obtains the encryption
      key, decrypts the reply, and then proceeds as usual.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 3.1 of this document enumerates the required algorithms and
   necessary extension message types.  Section 3.2 describes the
   extension messages in greater detail.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Definitions, Requirements, and Constants</h3></a>

   PKINIT also makes use of the following new authorization data type:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       AD_INITIAL_VERIFIED_CAS                       9

   The ASN.1 module for all structures defined in this document (plus
   IMPORT statements for all imported structures) is given in Appendix
   A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All structures defined in or imported into this document MUST be
   encoded using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X680] [X690]
   (unless otherwise noted).  All data structures carried in OCTET
   STRINGs MUST be encoded according to the rules specified in the
   specifications defining each data structure; a reference to the
   appropriate specification is provided for each data structure.
   Interoperability note: Some implementations may not be able to decode
   wrapped Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852] objects encoded
   with BER; specifically, they may not be able to decode indefinite-
   length encodings.  To maximize interoperability, implementers SHOULD
   encode CMS objects used in PKINIT with DER.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.4"><h4>3.1.4   Kerberos Encryption Types Defined for CMS Algorithm Identifiers</h4></a>

   PKINIT defines the following Kerberos encryption type numbers
   [RFC3961], which can be used in the etype field of the AS-REQ
   [RFC4120] message to indicate to the KDC the client's acceptance of
   the corresponding algorithms (including key transport algorithms
   [RFC3370], content encryption algorithms [RFC3370], and signature
   algorithms) for use with Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852]
   [RFC3370].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Per [RFC4120], the encryption types in the etype field are in the
   decreasing preference order of the client.  Note that there is no
   significance in the relative order between any two of different types
   of algorithms: key transport algorithms, content encryption
   algorithms, and signature algorithms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The presence of each of these encryption types in the etype field is
   equivalent to the presence of the corresponding algorithm Object
   Identifier (OID) in the supportedCMSTypes field as described in
   Section 3.2.1.  And the preference order expressed in the
   supportedCMSTypes field would override the preference order listed in
   the etype field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Kerberos Encryption Type Name  Num  Corresponding Algorithm OID

   The above encryption type numbers are used only to indicate support
   for the use of the corresponding algorithms in PKINIT; they do not
   correspond to actual Kerberos encryption types [RFC3961] and MUST NOT
   be used in the etype field of the Kerberos EncryptedData type
   [RFC4120].  The practice of assigning Kerberos encryption type
   numbers to indicate support for CMS algorithms is considered
   deprecated, and new numbers should not be assigned for this purpose.
   Instead, the supportedCMSTypes field should be used to identify the
   algorithms supported by the client and the preference order of the
   client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For maximum interoperability, however, PKINIT clients wishing to
   indicate to the KDC the support for one or more of the algorithms
   listed above SHOULD include the corresponding encryption type
   number(s) in the etype field of the AS-REQ.

   The ContentInfo [RFC3852] structure contained in the signedAuthPack
   field of the type PA-PK-AS-REQ is encoded according to [RFC3852] and
   is filled out as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The contentType field of the type ContentInfo is id-signedData
       (as defined in [RFC3852]), and the content field is a SignedData
       (as defined in [RFC3852]).
   2.  The eContentType field for the type SignedData is id-pkinit-
       authData: { iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)<br>
       kerberosv5(2) pkinit(3) authData(1) }.  Notes to CMS<br>
       implementers: the signed attribute content-type MUST be present
       in this SignedData instance, and its value is id-pkinit-authData
       according to [RFC3852].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  The eContent field for the type SignedData contains the DER
       encoding of the type AuthPack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  The signerInfos field of the type SignedData contains a single
       signerInfo, which contains the signature over the type AuthPack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  The AuthPack structure contains a PKAuthenticator, the client
       public key information, the CMS encryption types supported by the
       client, and a DHNonce.  The pkAuthenticator field certifies to
       the KDC that the client has recent knowledge of the signing key
       that authenticates the client.  The clientPublicValue field
       specifies Diffie-Hellman domain parameters and the client's
       public key value.  The DH public key value is encoded as a BIT
       STRING according to [RFC3279].  The clientPublicValue field is
       present only if the client wishes to use the Diffie-Hellman key
       agreement method.  The supportedCMSTypes field specifies the list
       of CMS algorithm identifiers that are supported by the client in
       order of (decreasing) preference, and can be used to identify a
       signature algorithm or a key transport algorithm [RFC3370] in the
       keyEncryptionAlgorithm field of the type KeyTransRecipientInfo,
       or a content encryption algorithm [RFC3370] in the
       contentEncryptionAlgorithm field of the type EncryptedContentInfo
       [RFC3852] when encrypting the AS reply key as described in
       Section 3.2.3.2.  However, there is no significance in the
       relative order between any two of different types of algorithms:
       key transport algorithms, content encryption algorithms, and
       signature algorithms.  The clientDHNonce field is described later
       in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   6.  The ctime field in the PKAuthenticator structure contains the
       current time on the client's host, and the cusec field contains
       the microsecond part of the client's timestamp.  The ctime and
       cusec fields are used together to specify a reasonably accurate
       timestamp [RFC4120].  The nonce field is chosen randomly.  The
       paChecksum field MUST be present and it contains a SHA1 checksum
       that is performed over the KDC-REQ-BODY [RFC4120].  In order to
       ease future migration from the use of SHA1, the paChecksum field
       is made optional syntactically: when the request is extended to
       negotiate hash algorithms, the new client wishing not to use SHA1
       will send the request in the extended message syntax without the
       paChecksum field.  The KDC conforming to this specification MUST
       return a KRB-ERROR [RFC4120] message with the code
       KDC_ERR_PA_CHECKSUM_MUST_BE_INCLUDED (see Section 3.2.3).  That
       will allow a new client to retry with SHA1 if allowed by the
       local policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   7.  The certificates field of the type SignedData contains
       certificates intended to facilitate certification path
       construction, so that the KDC can verify the signature over the
       type AuthPack.  For path validation, these certificates SHOULD be
       sufficient to construct at least one certification path from the
       client certificate to one trust anchor acceptable by the KDC
       [RFC4158].  The client MUST be capable of including such a set of
       certificates if configured to do so.  The certificates field MUST
       NOT contain "root" CA certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   8.  The client's Diffie-Hellman public value (clientPublicValue) is
       included if and only if the client wishes to use the Diffie-
       Hellman key agreement method.  The Diffie-Hellman domain
       parameters [IEEE1363] for the client's public key are specified
       in the algorithm field of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo
       [RFC3279], and the client's Diffie-Hellman public key value is
       mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a BIT STRING) according to
       [RFC3279].  When using the Diffie-Hellman key agreement method,
       implementations MUST support Oakley 1024-bit Modular Exponential
       (MODP) well-known group 2 [RFC2412] and Oakley 2048-bit MODP
       well-known group 14 [RFC3526] and SHOULD support Oakley 4096-bit
       MODP well-known group 16 [RFC3526].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       The Diffie-Hellman field size should be chosen so as to provide
       sufficient cryptographic security [RFC3766].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       When MODP Diffie-Hellman is used, the exponents should have at
       least twice as many bits as the symmetric keys that will be
       derived from them [ODL99].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   9.  The client may wish to reuse DH keys or to allow the KDC to do so
       (see Section 3.2.3.1).  If so, then the client includes the
       clientDHNonce field.  This nonce string MUST be as long as the
       longest key length of the symmetric key types that the client
       supports.  This nonce MUST be chosen randomly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ExternalPrincipalIdentifier structure is used in this document to
   identify the subject's public key thereby the subject principal.
   This structure is filled out as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The subjectName field contains a PKIX type Name encoded according
       to [RFC3280].  This field identifies the certificate subject by
       the distinguished subject name.  This field is REQUIRED when
       there is a distinguished subject name present in the certificate
       being used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  The issuerAndSerialNumber field contains a CMS type
       IssuerAndSerialNumber encoded according to [RFC3852].  This field
       identifies a certificate of the subject.  This field is REQUIRED
       for TD-INVALID-CERTIFICATES and TD-TRUSTED-CERTIFIERS (both
       structures are defined in Section 3.2.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  The subjectKeyIdentifier [RFC3852] field identifies the subject's
       public key by a key identifier.  When an X.509 certificate is
       referenced, this key identifier matches the X.509
       subjectKeyIdentifier extension value.  When other certificate
       formats are referenced, the documents that specify the
       certificate format and their use with the CMS must include
       details on matching the key identifier to the appropriate
       certificate field.  This field is RECOMMENDED for TD-TRUSTED-
       CERTIFIERS (as defined in Section 3.2.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The trustedCertifiers field of the type PA-PK-AS-REQ contains a list
   of CAs, trusted by the client, that can be used to certify the KDC.
   Each ExternalPrincipalIdentifier identifies a CA or a CA certificate
   (thereby its public key).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The kdcPkId field of the type PA-PK-AS-REQ contains a CMS type
   SignerIdentifier encoded according to [RFC3852].  This field
   identifies, if present, a particular KDC public key that the client
   already has.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2   Receipt of Client Request</h4></a>

   Upon receiving the client's request, the KDC validates it.  This
   section describes the steps that the KDC MUST (unless otherwise
   noted) take in validating the request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The KDC verifies the client's signature in the signedAuthPack field

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If, while validating the client's X.509 certificate [RFC3280], the
   KDC cannot build a certification path to validate the client's

   code KDC_ERR_CANT_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE.  The accompanying e-data for
   this error message is a TYPED-DATA (as defined in [RFC4120]) that
   contains an element whose data-type is TD_TRUSTED_CERTIFIERS, and
   whose data-value contains the DER encoding of the type TD-TRUSTED-

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receiving this error message, the client SHOULD retry only if it
   has a different set of certificates (from those of the previous
   requests) that form a certification path (or a partial path) from one
   of the trust anchors acceptable by the KDC to its own certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If, while processing the certification path, the KDC determines that
   the signature on one of the certificates in the signedAuthPack field
   is invalid, it returns a KRB-ERROR [RFC4120] message with the code
   KDC_ERR_INVALID_CERTIFICATE.  The accompanying e-data for this error
   message is a TYPED-DATA that contains an element whose data-type is
   TD_INVALID_CERTIFICATES, and whose data-value contains the DER

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each ExternalPrincipalIdentifier (as defined in Section 3.2.1) in the

   sent by the client) with an invalid signature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If more than one X.509 certificate signature is invalid, the KDC MAY
   include one IssuerAndSerialNumber per invalid signature within the
   TD-INVALID-CERTIFICATES.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client's X.509 certificate is validated according to [RFC3280].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Depending on local policy, the KDC may also check whether any X.509
   certificates in the certification path validating the client's
   certificate have been revoked.  If any of them have been revoked, the
   KDC MUST return an error message with the code
   KDC_ERR_REVOKED_CERTIFICATE; if the KDC attempts to determine the
   revocation status but is unable to do so, it SHOULD return an error
   message with the code KDC_ERR_REVOCATION_STATUS_UNKNOWN.  The
   certificate or certificates affected are identified exactly as for
   the error code KDC_ERR_INVALID_CERTIFICATE (see above).
   Note that the TD_INVALID_CERTIFICATES error data is only used to
   identify invalid certificates sent by the client in the request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client's public key is then used to verify the signature.  If the
   signature fails to verify, the KDC MUST return an error message with
   the code KDC_ERR_INVALID_SIG.  There is no accompanying e-data for
   this error message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to validating the client's signature, the KDC MUST also
   check that the client's public key used to verify the client's
   signature is bound to the client principal name specified in the AS-
   REQ as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. If the KDC has its own binding between either the client's
      signature-verification public key or the client's certificate and
      the client's Kerberos principal name, it uses that binding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Otherwise, if the client's X.509 certificate contains a Subject
      Alternative Name (SAN) extension carrying a KRB5PrincipalName
      (defined below) in the otherName field of the type GeneralName
      [RFC3280], it binds the client's X.509 certificate to that name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The type of the otherName field is AnotherName.  The type-id field
      of the type AnotherName is id-pkinit-san:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       id-pkinit-san OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=

       }

   If the Kerberos client name in the AS-REQ does not match a name bound
   by the KDC (the binding can be in the certificate, for example, as
   described above), or if there is no binding found by the KDC, the KDC
   MUST return an error message with the code
   KDC_ERR_CLIENT_NAME_MISMATCH.  There is no accompanying e-data for
   this error message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Even if the certification path is validated and the certificate is
   mapped to the client's principal name, the KDC may decide not to
   accept the client's certificate, depending on local policy.
   The KDC MAY require the presence of an Extended Key Usage (EKU)
   KeyPurposeId [RFC3280] id-pkinit-KPClientAuth in the extensions field

   an error message of the code KDC_ERR_INCONSISTENT_KEY_PURPOSE.  There
   is no accompanying e-data for this error message.  KDCs implementing
   this requirement SHOULD also accept the EKU KeyPurposeId
   id-ms-kp-sc-logon (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2) as meeting the
   requirement, as there are a large number of X.509 client certificates
   deployed for use with PKINIT that have this EKU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As a matter of local policy, the KDC MAY decide to reject requests on

       it MUST include an expiration time in the dhKeyExpiration field.
       Past the point of the expiration time, the signature over the

       reuses DH keys then, it MUST include a serverDHNonce at least as
       long as the length of keys for the symmetric encryption system
       used to encrypt the AS reply.  Note that including the
       serverDHNonce changes how the client and server calculate the key
       to use to encrypt the reply; see below for details.  The KDC
       SHOULD NOT reuse DH keys unless the clientDHNonce field is

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The AS reply key is derived as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. Both the KDC and the client calculate the shared secret value as
      follows:
          a) When MODP Diffie-Hellman is used, let DHSharedSecret be the
          shared secret value.  DHSharedSecret is the value ZZ, as
          described in Section 2.1.1 of [RFC2631].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      DHSharedSecret is first padded with leading zeros such that the

      order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Implementation note: Both the client and the KDC can cache the
      triple (ya, yb, DHSharedSecret), where ya is the client's public
      key and yb is the KDC's public key.  If both ya and yb are the
      same in a later exchange, the cached DHSharedSecret can be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Let K be the key-generation seed length [RFC3961] of the AS reply
      key whose enctype is selected according to [RFC4120].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. Define the function octetstring2key() as follows:

      where x is an octet string; | is the concatenation operator; 0x00,
      0x01, 0x02, etc. are each represented as a single octet; random-
      to-key() is an operation that generates a protocol key from a
      bitstring of length K; and K-truncate truncates its input to the
      first K bits.  Both K and random-to-key() are as defined in the
      kcrypto profile [RFC3961] for the enctype of the AS reply key.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4. When DH keys are reused, let n_c be the clientDHNonce and n_k be
      the serverDHNonce; otherwise, let both n_c and n_k be empty octet

   If pre-authentication is required but was not present in the request,
   per [RFC4120] an error message with the code KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED
   is returned, and a METHOD-DATA object will be stored in the e-data
   field of the KRB-ERROR message to specify which pre-authentication
   mechanisms are acceptable.  The KDC can then indicate the support of
   PKINIT by including an empty element whose padata-type is
   PA_PK_AS_REQ in that METHOD-DATA object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Otherwise if it is required by the KDC's local policy that the client
   must be pre-authenticated using the pre-authentication mechanism
   specified in this document, but no PKINIT pre-authentication was
   present in the request, an error message with the code
   KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED SHOULD be returned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   KDCs MUST leave the padata-value field of the PA_PK_AS_REQ element in
   the KRB-ERROR's METHOD-DATA empty (i.e., send a zero-length OCTET
   STRING), and clients MUST ignore this and any other value.  Future
   extensions to this protocol may specify other data to send instead of
   an empty OCTET STRING.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The security of cryptographic algorithms is dependent on generating
   secret quantities [RFC4086].  The number of truly random bits is
   extremely important in determining the attack resistance strength of
   the cryptosystem; for example, the secret Diffie-Hellman exponents
   must be chosen based on n truly random bits (where n is the system
   security requirement).  The security of the overall system is
   significantly weakened by using insufficient random inputs: a
   sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the
   environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the
   resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in
   the whole of the potential number space.
   Kerberos error messages are not integrity protected; as a result, the
   domain parameters sent by the KDC as TD-DH-PARAMETERS can be tampered
   with by an attacker so that the set of domain parameters selected
   could be either weaker or not mutually preferred.  Local policy can
   configure sets of domain parameters acceptable locally, or disallow
   the negotiation of DH domain parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The symmetric reply key size and Diffie-Hellman field size or RSA
   modulus size should be chosen so as to provide sufficient
   cryptographic security [RFC3766].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When MODP Diffie-Hellman is used, the exponents should have at least
   twice as many bits as the symmetric keys that will be derived from
   them [ODL99].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKINIT raises certain security considerations beyond those that can
   be regulated strictly in protocol definitions.  We will address them
   in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKINIT extends the cross-realm model to the public-key
   infrastructure.  Users of PKINIT must understand security policies
   and procedures appropriate to the use of Public Key Infrastructures
   [RFC3280].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to trust a KDC certificate that is certified by a CA as a
   KDC certificate for a target realm (for example, by asserting the TGS
   name of that Kerberos realm as an id-pkinit-san SAN and/or
   restricting the certificate usage by using the id-pkinit-KPKdc EKU,
   as described in Section 3.2.4), the client MUST verify that the KDC
   certificate's issuing CA is authorized to issue KDC certificates for
   that target realm.  Otherwise, the binding between the KDC
   certificate and the KDC of the target realm is not established.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   How to validate this authorization is a matter of local policy.  A
   way to achieve this is the configuration of specific sets of
   intermediary CAs and trust anchors, one of which must be on the KDC
   certificate's certification path [RFC3280], and, for each CA or trust
   anchor, the realms for which it is allowed to issue certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, if any CA that is trusted to issue KDC certificates can
   also issue other kinds of certificates, then local policy must be
   able to distinguish between them; for example, it could require that
   KDC certificates contain the id-pkinit-KPKdc EKU or that the realm be
   specified with the id-pkinit-san SAN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is the responsibility of the PKI administrators for an
   organization to ensure that KDC certificates are only issued to KDCs,
   and that clients can ascertain this using their local policy.
   Standard Kerberos allows the possibility of interactions between
   cryptosystems of varying strengths; this document adds interactions
   with public-key cryptosystems to Kerberos.  Some administrative
   policies may allow the use of relatively weak public keys.  When
   using such weak asymmetric keys to protect/exchange stronger
   symmetric Keys, the attack resistant strength of the overall system
   is no better than that of these weak keys [RFC3766].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKINIT requires that keys for symmetric cryptosystems be generated.
   Some such systems contain "weak" keys.  For recommendations regarding
   these weak keys, see [RFC4120].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKINIT allows the use of the same RSA key pair for encryption and
   signing when doing RSA encryption-based key delivery.  This is not
   recommended usage of RSA keys [RFC3447]; by using DH-based key
   delivery, this is avoided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Care should be taken in how certificates are chosen for the purposes
   of authentication using PKINIT.  Some local policies may require that
   key escrow be used for certain certificate types.  Deployers of
   PKINIT should be aware of the implications of using certificates that
   have escrowed keys for the purposes of authentication.  Because
   signing-only certificates are normally not escrowed, by using DH-
   based key delivery this is avoided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKINIT does not provide for a "return routability" test to prevent
   attackers from mounting a denial-of-service attack on the KDC by
   causing it to perform unnecessary and expensive public-key
   operations.  Strictly speaking, this is also true of standard
   Kerberos, although the potential cost is not as great, because
   standard Kerberos does not make use of public-key cryptography.  By
   using DH-based key delivery and reusing DH keys, the necessary crypto
   processing cost per request can be minimized.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method is used, additional pre-
   authentication data [RFC4120] (in addition to the PA_PK_AS_REQ, as
   defined in this specification) is not bound to the AS_REQ by the
   mechanisms discussed in this specification (meaning it may be dropped
   or added by attackers without being detected by either the client or
   the KDC).  Designers of additional pre-authentication data should
   take that into consideration if such additional pre-authentication
   data can be used in conjunction with the PA_PK_AS_REQ.  The future
   work of the Kerberos working group is expected to update the hash
   algorithms specified in this document and provide a generic mechanism
   to bind additional pre-authentication data with the accompanying
   AS_REQ.
   The key usage number 6 used by the asChecksum field is also used for
   the authenticator checksum (cksum field of AP-REQ) contained in the
   PA-TGS-REQ preauthentication data contained in a TGS-REQ [RFC4120].
   This conflict is present for historical reasons; the reuse of key
   usage numbers is strongly discouraged.

Appendix C.  Miscellaneous Information about Microsoft Windows PKINIT
             Implementations

   Earlier revisions of the PKINIT I-D were implemented in various
   releases of Microsoft Windows and deployed in fairly large numbers.
   To enable the community to interoperate better with systems running
   those releases, the following information may be useful.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   KDC certificates issued by Windows 2000 Enterprise CAs contain a
   dNSName SAN with the DNS name of the host running the KDC, and the
   id-kp-serverAuth EKU [RFC3280].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   KDC certificates issued by Windows 2003 Enterprise CAs contain a
   dNSName SAN with the DNS name of the host running the KDC, the id-
   kp-serverAuth EKU, and the id-ms-kp-sc-logon EKU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is anticipated that the next release of Windows is already too far
   along to allow it to support the issuing KDC certificates with id-
   pkinit-san SAN as specified in this RFC.  Instead, they will have a
   dNSName SAN containing the domain name of the KDC, and the intended
   purpose of these KDC certificates will be restricted by the presence
   of the id-pkinit-KPKdc EKU and id-kp-serverAuth EKU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to checking that the above are present in a KDC
   certificate, Windows clients verify that the issuer of the KDC
   certificate is one of a set of allowed issuers of such certificates,
   so those wishing to issue KDC certificates need to configure their
   Windows clients appropriately.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Client certificates accepted by Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 Server
   KDCs must contain an id-ms-san-sc-logon-upn (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3)
   SAN and the id-ms-kp-sc-logon EKU.  The id-ms-san-sc-logon-upn SAN
   contains a UTF8-encoded string whose value is that of the Directory
   Service attribute UserPrincipalName of the client account object, and
   the purpose of including the id-ms-san-sc-logon-upn SAN in the client
   certificate is to validate the client mapping (in other words, the
   client's public key is bound to the account that has this
   UserPrincipalName value).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that all Microsoft Kerberos realm names are
   domain-style realm names and strictly in uppercase.  In addition, the
   UserPrincipalName attribute is globally unique in Windows 2000 and
   Windows 2003.
