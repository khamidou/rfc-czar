	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes how compressed iLBC speech, as produced by
   the iLBC codec [1], may be formatted for use as an RTP payload type.
   Methods are provided to packetize the codec data frames into RTP
   packets.  The sender may send one or more codec data frames per
   packet depending on the application scenario or based on the
   transport network condition, bandwidth restriction, delay
   requirements and packet-loss tolerance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Background</h2></a>

   Global IP Sound (GIPS) has developed a speech compression algorithm
   for use in IP based communications [1].  The iLBC codec enables
   graceful speech quality degradation in the case of lost frames, which
   occurs in connection with lost or delayed IP packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This codec is suitable for real time communications such as,
   telephony and videoconferencing, streaming audio, archival and
   messaging.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The iLBC codec [1] is an algorithm that compresses each basic frame
   (20 ms or 30 ms) of 8000 Hz, 16-bit sampled input speech, into output
   frames with rate of 400 bits for 30 ms basic frame size and 304 bits
   for 20 ms basic frame size.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The codec supports two basic frame lengths: 30 ms at 13.33 kbit/s and
   20 ms at 15.2 kbit/s, using a block independent linear-predictive
   coding (LPC) algorithm.  When the codec operates at block lengths of
   20 ms, it produces 304 bits per block which MUST be packetized in 38
   bytes.  Similarly, for block lengths of 30 ms it produces 400 bits
   per block which MUST be packetized in 50 bytes.  This algorithm
   results in a speech coding system with a controlled response to
   packet losses similar to what is known from pulse code modulation
   (PCM) with a packet loss concealment (PLC), such as ITU-T G711
   standard [7], which operates at a fixed bit rate of 64 kbit/s.  At
   the same time, this algorithm enables fixed bit rate coding with a
   quality-versus-bit rate tradeoff close to what is known from code-
   excited linear prediction (CELP).
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   RTP Payload Format</h2></a>

   The iLBC codec uses 20 or 30 ms frames and a sampling rate clock of 8
   kHz, so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/8000 of a second. The
   RTP payload for iLBC has the format shown in the figure bellow. No
   addition header specific to this payload format is required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This format is intended for the situations where the sender and the
   receiver send one or more codec data frames per packet.  The RTP
   packet looks as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Figure 1, Packet format diagram

   The RTP header of the packetized encoded iLBC speech has the expected
   values as described in [3].  The usage of M bit SHOULD be as
   specified in the applicable RTP profile, for example, RFC 3551 [4]
   specifies that if the sender does not suppress silence (i.e., sends a
   frame on every frame interval), the M bit will always be zero.  When
   more then one codec data frame is present in a single RTP packet, the
   timestamp is, as always, the oldest data frame represented in the RTP
   packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if that
   is not done, then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be chosen
   by the sender.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Bitstream definition</h3></a>

   The total number of bits used to describe one frame of 20 ms speech
   is 304, which fits in 38 bytes and results in a bit rate of 15.20
   kbit/s.  For the case with a frame length of 30 ms speech the total
   number of bits used is 400, which fits in 50 bytes and results in a
   bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s.  In the bitstream definition, the bits are
   distributed into three classes according to their bit error or loss
   sensitivity.  The most sensitive bits (class 1) are placed first in
   the bitstream for each frame.  The less sensitive bits (class 2) are
   placed after the class 1 bits.  The least sensitive bits (class 3)
   are placed at the end of the bitstream for each frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Looking at the 20/30 ms frame length cases for each class: The class
   1 bits occupy a total of 6/8 bytes (48/64 bits), the class 2 bits
   occupy 8/12 bytes (64/96 bits), and the class 3 bits occupy 24/30
   bytes (191/239 bits).  This distribution of the bits enables the use
   of uneven level protection (ULP).  The detailed bit allocation is
   shown in the table below.  When a quantization index is distributed
   between more classes the more significant bits belong to the lowest
   class.

   Table 3.1 The bitstream definition for iLBC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When packetized into the payload, all the class 1 bits MUST be sorted
   in order (from top and down) as they were specified in the table.
   Additionally, all the class 2 bits MUST be sorted (from top and down)
   and all the class 3 bits MUST be sorted in the same sequential order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Multiple iLBC frames in a RTP packet</h3></a>

   More than one iLBC frame may be included in a single RTP packet by a
   sender.
   It is important to observe that senders have the following additional
   restrictions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  SHOULD NOT include more iLBC frames in a single RTP packet than
      will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Frames of the different modes (20 ms and 30 ms) MUST NOT be
      included within the same packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP
   packet are consistent with the application.  For example, in
   telephony and other real time applications where delay is important,
   the delay is lower depending on the amount of frames per packet
   (i.e., fewer frames per packet, the lower the delay).  Whereas for
   bandwidth constrained links or delay insensitive streaming messaging
   application, one or more frames per packet would be acceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The way to
   determine the number of iLBC frames is to count the total number of
   octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count by the
   number of expected octets per frame (32/50 per frame).

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Mapping To SDP Parameters</h2></a>

   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [5], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the iLBC codec, the mapping is as
   follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The MIME subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.
   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The parameter "mode" goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying
      it directly from the MIME media type string as "mode=value".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When conveying information by SDP, the encoding name SHALL be "iLBC"
   (the same as the MIME subtype).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing iLBC
   might be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000

   If 20 ms frame size mode is used, remote iLBC encoder SHALL receive
   "mode" parameter in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying them
   directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon separated
   with parameter=value, where parameter is "mode", and values can be 0
   and 20 (where 0 is reserved and 20 stands for preferred 20 ms frame
   size).  An example of the media representation in SDP for describing
   iLBC when 20 ms frame size mode is used might be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
      a=fmtp:97 mode=20

   It is important to emphasize the bi-directional character of the
   "mode" parameter - both sides of a bi-directional session MUST use
   the same "mode" value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The offer contains the preferred mode of the offerer.  The answerer
   may agree to that mode by including the same mode in the answer, or
   may include a different mode.  The resulting mode used by both
   parties SHALL be the lower of the bandwidth modes in the offer and
   answer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   That is, an offer of "mode=20" receiving an answer of "mode=30" will
   result in "mode=30" being used by both participants.  Similarly, an
   offer of "mode=30" and an answer of "mode=20" will result in
   "mode=30" being used by both participants.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is important when one end point utilizes a bandwidth constrained
   link (e.g., 28.8k modem link or slower), where only the lower frame
   size will work.
   Parameter ptime can not be used for the purpose of specifying iLBC
   operating mode, due to fact that for the certain values it will be
   impossible to distinguish which mode is about to be used (e.g., when
   ptime=60, it would be impossible to distinguish if packet is carrying
   2 frames of 30 ms or 3 frames of 20 ms, etc.).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in
   upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.  These
   names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly, parameter
   names are case-insensitive both in MIME types and in the default
   mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in [3]
   and any appropriate profile (e.g., [4]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As this format transports encoded speech, the main security issues
   include confidentiality and authentication of the speech itself.  The
   payload format itself does not have any built-in security mechanisms.
   Confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption,
   therefore external mechanisms, such as SRTP [6], MAY be used for that
   purpose.  The data compression used with this payload format is
   applied end-to-end; hence encryption may be performed after
   compression with no conflict between the two operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   become overloaded.  However, the encodings covered in this document
   do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.
