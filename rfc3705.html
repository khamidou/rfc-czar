   This document presents a set of High Capacity Textual Conventions for
   use in MIB modules which require performance history based upon 15
   minute intervals.  The Textual Conventions defined in this document
   extend the conventions presented in RFC 3593 to 64 bit resolution
   using the conventions presented in RFC 2856.

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overview</h2></a>

   In cases where a manager must obtain performance history data about
   the behavior of equipment it manages, several strategies can be
   followed in the design of a MIB module that represents the managed
   equipment, including:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The agent counts events on a continuous basis and, whenever
      desired, the manager obtains the value of the event counter and
      adjusts its understanding of the history of events at the agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The agent allocates events to 'buckets' where each bucket
      represents an interval of time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Telecommunications equipment often makes use of the latter strategy.
   For such equipment the standard practice is that history data is
   maintained by the agent in terms of 15-minute intervals [T1.231].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MIB modules for collecting performance history based on 15-minute
   intervals have been defined for the DS1/E1 [RFC2495], DS3/E3
   [RFC2496], SONET/SDH [RFC3592], ADSL [RFC2662], HDLS2 and SHDSL
   [RFC3276] interface types.  These MIB modules use a common set of
   textual conventions defined in [RFC3593].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A need has arisen to define 64-bit versions of the textual
   conventions in [RFC3593].  Ideally, these high-capacity textual
   conventions would be based on a Gauge64 or Unsigned64 data type, but
   unfortunately no such types exist in SMIv2.  The next best choice
   would be to base them on the CounterBasedGauge64 textual convention
   presented in [RFC2856], but that is not possible either since SMIv2
   allows only base types to be used in defining textual conventions.
   Therefore, the textual conventions presented in this memo are based
   directly on the Counter64 type, like those in [RFC2856].  They are
   subject to the following limitations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The MAX-ACCESS of objects defined using these textual conventions
      must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS of the underlying
      Counter64 type is read-only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  No sub-range can be specified in object definitions using these
      textual conventions, because sub-ranges are not allowed on
      Counter64 objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  No DEFVAL clause can be specified in object definitions using
      these textual conventions, because DEFVALs are not allowed on
      Counter64 objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Objects defined using these textual conventions cannot be used in
      an INDEX clause, because there is no INDEX clause mapping defined
      for objects of type Counter64.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of the textual conventions presented in this memo assumes the
   following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The agent supports 15 minute based history counters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The agent is capable of keeping a history of 96 intervals of 15
      minute performance data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The agent may optionally support performance data aggregating the
      history intervals.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The agent will keep separate tables for the current interval, the
      history intervals, and the total aggregates.

   HCPerfValidIntervals ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
          "The number of near end intervals for which data was
          collected.  The value of an object with an
          HCPerfValidIntervals syntax will be 96 unless the

          minute intervals for which the agent has at least some data.
          In certain cases (e.g., in the case where the agent is a
          proxy) it is possible that some intervals are unavailable.

   HCPerfInvalidIntervals ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
          "The number of near end intervals for which no data is
          available.  The value of an object with an
          HCPerfInvalidIntervals syntax will typically be zero except
          in cases where the data for some intervals are not available
          (e.g., in proxy situations)."
       SYNTAX   Integer32 (0..96)

   HCPerfTimeElapsed ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
          "The number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning
          of the current measurement period.  If, for some reason,
          such as an adjustment in the system's time-of-day clock or

          the maximum value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          For 15 minute intervals, the range is limited to (0..899).

       STATUS   current
       DESCRIPTION
           "This convention defines a range of values that may be set
           in a fault threshold alarm control.  As the number of
           seconds in a 15-minute interval numbers at most 900,
           objects of this type may have a range of 0...900, where the
           value of 0 disables the alarm."

   HCPerfCurrentCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
           "A gauge associated with a performance measurement in a
            current 15 minute measurement interval.  The value of an
            object with an HCPerfCurrentCount syntax starts from zero
            and is increased when associated events occur, until the
            end of the 15 minute interval.  At that time the value of
            the gauge is stored in the first 15 minute history
            interval, and the gauge is restarted at zero.  In the case
            where the agent has no valid data available for the
            current interval, the corresponding object instance is not
            available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding
            error message shall be returned to indicate that this
            instance does not exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            This count represents a non-negative integer, which
            may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed 2^64-1

            value of an object with HCPerfCurrentCount syntax
            assumes its maximum value whenever the underlying count
            exceeds 2^64-1.  If the underlying count subsequently
            decreases below 2^64-1 (due, e.g., to a retroactive
            adjustment as a result of entering or exiting unavailable
            time), then the object's value also decreases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
            because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap'
            semantics associated with the Counter64 base type are not
            preserved.  It is possible that management applications
            which rely solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to
            determine object semantics will mistakenly operate upon
            objects of this type as they would for Counter64 objects.

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
