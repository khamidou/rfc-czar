	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   ITU-T G.722.1 [ITU.G7221] is a low-complexity coder; it compresses 50
   Hz - 14 kHz audio signals into one of the following bit rates: 24
   kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, or 48 kbit/s.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The coder may be used for speech, music, and other types of audio.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some of the applications for which this coder is suitable are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Real-time communications such as videoconferencing and telephony

   o  Streaming audio

   o  Archival and messaging

   ITU-T G.722.1 [ITU.G7221] uses 20-ms frames and a sampling rate clock
   of 16 kHz or 32kHz.  The encoding and decoding algorithm can change
   the bit rate at any 20-ms frame boundary, but no bit rate change
   notification is provided in-band with the bit stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For any given bit rate, the number of bits in a frame is a constant.
   Within this fixed frame, G.722.1 uses variable-length coding (e.g.,
   Huffman coding) to represent most of the encoded parameters.  All
   variable-length codes are transmitted in order from the leftmost bit
   (most significant bit -- MSB) to the rightmost bit (least significant
   bit -- LSB), see [ITU.G7221] for more details.
   The ITU-T standardized bit rates for G.722.1 are 24 kbit/s or
   32kbit/s at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, or 48
   kbit/s at 32 Khz sample rate.  However, the coding algorithm itself
   has the capability to run at any user-specified bit rate (not just
   24, 32, and 48 kbit/s) while maintaining an audio bandwidth of 50 Hz
   to 14 kHz.  This rate change is accomplished by a linear scaling of
   the codec operation, resulting in frames with size in bits equal to
   1/50 of the corresponding bit rate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   RTP Usage for G.722.1</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   RTP G.722.1 Header Fields</h3></a>

   The RTP header is defined in the RTP specification [RFC3550].  This
   section defines how fields in the RTP header are used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this
      packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is
      specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is
      used, or it is signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant
      for the first frame in the RTP packet.  The sampling frequency can
      be 16 Khz or 32 Khz.  The RTP timestamp clock frequency of 32 Khz
      SHOULD be used unless only an RTP stream sampled at 16 Khz is
      going to be sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   RTP Payload Format for G.722.1</h3></a>

   The RTP payload for G.722.1 has the format shown in Figure 1.  No
   additional header fields specific to this payload format are
   required.

                     Figure 1: RTP payload for G.722.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Because bit rate is not signaled in-band, a separate out-of-band
   method is REQUIRED to indicate the bit rate (see Section 5 for an
   example of signaling bit rate information using SDP).  For the
   payload format specified here, the bit rate MUST remain constant for
   a particular payload type value.  An application MAY switch bit rates
   and clock rates from packet to packet by defining different payload
   type values and switching between them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of Huffman coding means that it is not possible to identify
   the various encoded parameters/fields contained within the bit stream
   without first completely decoding the entire frame.  For the purposes
   of packetizing the bit stream in RTP, it is only necessary to
   consider the sequence of bits as output by the G.722.1 encoder and to
   present the same sequence to the decoder.  The payload format
   described here maintains this sequence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When operating at 24 kbit/s, 480 bits (60 octets) are produced per
   frame.  When operating at 32 kbit/s, 640 bits (80 octets) are
   produced per frame.  When operating at 48 kbit/s, 960 bits (120
   octets) are produced per frame.  Thus, all three bit rates allow for
   octet alignment without the need for padding bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 2 illustrates how the G.722.1 bit stream MUST be mapped into
   an octet-aligned RTP payload.

           Figure 2:  The G.722.1 encoder bit stream is split into
                      a sequence of octets (60, 80, or 120 depending on
                      the bit rate), and each octet is in turn
                      mapped into an RTP octet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When operating at non-standard rates, the payload format MUST follow
   the guidelines illustrated in Figure 2.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   values in the range 16000 to 48000 be used.  Non-standard rates MUST
   have a value that is a multiple of 400 (this maintains octet
   alignment and does not then require (undefined) padding bits for each
   frame if not octet aligned).  For example, a bit rate of 16.4 kbit/s
   will result in a frame of size 328 bits or 41 octets, which is mapped
   into RTP per Figure 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Multiple G.722.1 Frames in an RTP Packet</h3></a>

   A sender may include more than one consecutive G.722.1 frame in a
   single RTP packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Senders have the following additional restrictions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Sender SHOULD NOT include more G.722.1 frames in a single RTP
      packet than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  All frames contained in a single RTP packet MUST be of the same
      length and sampled at the same clock rate.  They MUST have the
      same bit rate (octets per frame).
   o  Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP
   packet be consistent with the application.  For example, in a
   telephony application where delay is important, the fewer frames per
   packet, the lower the delay; whereas for a delay-insensitive
   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would be
   acceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Computing the Number of G.722.1 Frames</h3></a>

   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of G.722.1 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP packet and divide the octet count by
   the number of expected octets per frame.  This expected octet-per-
   frame count is derived from the bit rate and is therefore a function
   of the payload type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be audio.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be G7221 (the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Only one bitrate SHALL be defined (using the "bitrate=" parameter
      in the a=fmtp line) for each payload type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Usage with the SDP Offer/Answer Model</h3></a>

   When offering G.722.1 over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264], the following considerations are necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The combination of the clock rate in the rtpmap and the bitrate
   parameter defines the configuration of each payload type.  Each
   configuration intended to be used MUST be declared.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two sampling clock rates defined for G.722.1 in this
   document.  RFC 3047 [RFC3047] supports only the 16 Khz clock rate.
   Therefore, a system that wants to use G.722.1 SHOULD offer a payload
   type with clock rate of 16000 for backward interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example of an offer that includes a 16000 and 32000 clock rate is:

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity-protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient; although, if
   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is
   [RFC3711] recommended.  Another mechanism that may be used is IPsec
   [RFC4301] Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP);
   other alternatives may exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational
   complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a
   denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological data.
   Nor does the RTP payload format contain any active content.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Changes from RFC 3047</h2></a>

   This specification obsoletes RFC 3047, adding the support for the
   Superwideband (14 Khz) audio support defined in annex C of the new
