   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   It is highly desired, in several cases, to take into account Traffic
   Engineering (TE) node capabilities during Multi Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered
   Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) selection, such as, for instance, the
   capability to act as a branch Label Switching Router (LSR) of a
   Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) LSP.  This requires advertising these
   capabilities within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  For that
   purpose, this document specifies Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and
   Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS) traffic engineering
   extensions for the advertisement of control plane and data plane
   traffic engineering node capabilities.

   Multi Protocol Label Switching-Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) routing
   ([RFC3784], [RFC3630], [OSPFv3-TE]) relies on extensions to link
   state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) ([IS-IS], [RFC1195],
   [RFC2328], [RFC2740]) in order to advertise Traffic Engineering (TE)
   link information used for constraint-based routing.  Further
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) related routing extensions are defined in
   [RFC4205] and [RFC4203].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is desired to complement these routing extensions in order to
   advertise TE node capabilities, in addition to TE link information.
   These TE node capabilities will be taken into account as constraints
   during path selection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Indeed, it is useful to advertise data plane TE node capabilities,
   such as the capability for a Label Switching Router (LSR) to be a
   branch LSR or a bud-LSR of a Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Label
   Switched Path (LSP).  These capabilities can then be taken into
   account as constraints when computing the route of TE LSPs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is also useful to advertise control plane TE node capabilities
   such as the capability to support GMPLS signaling for a packet LSR,
   or the capability to support P2MP (Point to Multipoint) TE LSP
   signaling.  This allows selecting a path that avoids nodes that do
   not support a given control plane feature, or triggering a mechanism
   to support such nodes on a path.  Hence, this facilitates backward
   compatibility.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For that purpose, this document specifies IGP (OSPF and IS-IS)
   extensions in order to advertise data plane and control plane
   capabilities of a node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A new TLV is defined for OSPF, the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV,
   to be carried within the Router Information LSA ([RFC4970]).  A new
   sub-TLV is defined for IS-IS, the TE Node Capability Descriptor
   sub-TLV, to be carried within the IS-IS Capability TLV ([RFC4971]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC3031], [RFC3209], and
   [RFC4461].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   TE Node Capability Descriptor</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Description</h3></a>

   LSRs in a network may have distinct control plane and data plane
   Traffic Engineering capabilities.  The TE Node Capability Descriptor
   information defined in this document describes data and control plane
   capabilities of an LSR.  Such information can be used during path
   computation so as to avoid nodes that do not support a given TE
   feature either in the control or data plane, or to trigger procedures
   to handle these nodes along the path (e.g., trigger LSP hierarchy to
   support a legacy transit LSR on a P2MP LSP (see [RFC4875])).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Required Information</h3></a>

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor contains a variable-length set of
   bit flags, where each bit corresponds to a given TE node capability.
   Five TE Node Capabilities are defined in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - B bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act
               as a branch node on a P2MP LSP (see [RFC4461]);
      - E bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act
               as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e., an LSR that is both
               transit and egress (see [RFC4461]);
      - M bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports
               MPLS-TE signaling ([RFC3209]);
      - G bit: when set this flag indicates that the LSR supports
               GMPLS signaling ([RFC3473]);
      - P bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports
               P2MP MPLS-TE signaling ([RFC4875]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that new capability bits may be added in the future if required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV Formats</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV Format</h3></a>

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is a variable length TLV
   that contains a series of bit flags, where each bit correspond to a
   TE node capability.  The bit-field MAY be extended with additional
   32-bit words if more bit flags need to be assigned.  Any unknown bit
   flags SHALL be treated as Reserved bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried within an OSPF
   Router Information LSA, which is defined in [RFC4970].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The format of the OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is the same
   as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [RFC3630].  That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2
   octets specifying the length of the value field, and a value field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TYPE:     5 (see Section 8.1)
      LENGTH:   Variable (multiple of 4).

                significant bit as bit zero, where each bit represents
                a TE node capability.
   The following bits are defined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bit       Capabilities

   0      B bit: P2MP Branch Node capability: When set, this indicates

          that the LSR can act as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e., an
          LSR that is both transit and egress [RFC4461].
   2      M bit: If set, this indicates that the LSR supports MPLS-TE
          signaling ([RFC3209]).
   3      G bit: If set, this indicates that the LSR supports GMPLS
          signaling ([RFC3473]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5-31   Reserved for future assignments by IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reserved bits MUST be set to zero on transmission, and MUST be

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV format</h3></a>

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is a variable length
   sub-TLV that contains a series of bit flags, where each bit
   corresponds to a TE node capability.  The bit-field MAY be extended
   with additional bytes if more bit flags need to be assigned.  Any
   unknown bit flags SHALL be treated as Reserved bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is carried within an
   IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV, which is defined in [RFC4971].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The format of the IS-IS TE Node Capability sub-TLV is the same as the
   sub-TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS
   [RFC3784].  That is, the sub-TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type,
   1 octet specifying the length of the value field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV has the following
   format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Elements of Procedure</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   OSPF</h3></a>

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is advertised, within an OSPFv2
   Router Information LSA (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0) or an
   OSPFv3 Router Information LSA (function code of 12), which are
   defined in [RFC4970].  As such, elements of procedure are inherited
   from those defined in [RFC2328], [RFC2740], and [RFC4970].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV advertises capabilities that
   may be taken into account as constraints during path selection.
   Hence, its flooding scope is area-local, and it MUST be carried
   within an OSPFv2 type 10 Router Information LSA (as defined in
   [RFC2370]) or an OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set
   and the S2 bit cleared (as defined in [RFC2740]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A router MUST originate a new OSPF Router Information LSA whenever
   the content of the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV changes or
   whenever required by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA refresh (every
   LSRefreshTime)).
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT appear
   more than once in an OSPF Router Information LSA.  If a TE Node
   Capability Descriptor TLV appears more than once in an OSPF Router
   Information LSA, only the first occurrence MUST be processed and
   others MUST be ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an OSPF Router Information LSA does not contain any TE Node
   Capability Descriptor TLV, this means that the TE node capabilities
   of that LSR are unknown.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation, but MUST NOT
   trigger normal SPF computation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note also that TE node capabilities are expected to be fairly static.
   They may change as the result of configuration change or software
   upgrade.  This is expected not to appear more than once a day.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   IS-IS</h3></a>

   The TE Node Capability sub-TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY
   TLV defined in [RFC4971].  As such, elements of procedure are
   inherited from those defined in [RFC4971].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV advertises capabilities
   that may be taken into account as constraints during path selection.
   Hence, its flooding is area-local, and it MUST be carried within an

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Backward Compatibility</h2></a>

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs defined in this document do
   not introduce any interoperability issues.  For OSPF, a router not
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV will just silently
   ignore the TLV, as specified in [RFC4970].  For IS-IS, a router not
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV will just
   silently ignore the sub-TLV, as specified in [RFC4971].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is absent, this means that
   the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The absence of a word of capability flags in OSPF or an octet of
   capability flags in IS-IS means that these capabilities are unknown.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document specifies the content of the TE Node Capability
   Descriptor TLV in IS-IS and OSPF to be used for (G)MPLS-TE path
   computation.  As this TLV is not used for SPF computation or normal
   routing, the extensions specified here have no direct effect on IP
   routing.  Tampering with this TLV may have an effect on Traffic
   Engineering computation.  Mechanisms defined to secure IS-IS Link
   State PDUs [RFC3567], OSPF LSAs [RFC2154], and their TLVs can be used
   to secure this TLV as well.
