Host Address Changes Involving RAND and ISI


   This week the RAND IMP was temporarily removed from the
   Network and a new IMP was installed at ISI.  Some of the
   people and computers from RAND have moved to ISI, in
   particular the RAND TENEX is now the ISI TENEX.  The address
   of the ISI IMP is 86 (decimal) and the TENEX at ISI is Host
   number one; thus the "Network Address" of the ISI TENEX is 86.
   Sometime early next week the RAND IMP will be re-installed.
   It will still be IMP number 7, and the IBM 360/65 at RAND will
   still be "Network Address" 7.
