                 Formally Deprecating Some IPv4 Options

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have
   never been formally deprecated.  This document deprecates such IPv4
   options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry.
   Additionally, it obsoletes RFCs 1385, 1393, 1475, and 1770, and
   requests that the RFC Editor change their status to Historic.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) [RFC791] provides for
   expansion of the protocol by supporting a number of "options" in the
   variable-length IPv4 header.  IPv4 options are identified by an
   option "type" value, whose registration is managed by IANA [IANA-IP].
   A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have
   never been formally deprecated.  This document deprecates such IPv4
   options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document also obsoletes [RFC1385], [RFC1393], [RFC1475], and
   [RFC1770], and requests that the RFC Editor change their status to
   Historic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Discussion of Deprecated Options</h2></a>

   The following subsections discuss the options being deprecated.  No
   other reference information has been found.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Stream ID</h3></a>

   The Stream ID option is obsolete.  It is specified in RFC 791
   [RFC791], and is deprecated in Section 3.2.1.8 of RFC 1122 [RFC1122]
   and Section 4.2.2.1 of RFC 1812 [RFC1812].
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Extended Internet Protocol</h3></a>

   The Extended Internet Protocol option is defined in [RFC1385] and is
   superseded by [RFC2460].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Traceroute</h3></a>

   The Traceroute option is defined in [RFC1393].  The Traceroute option
   is defined as Experimental; it was never widely deployed on the
   public Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   ENCODE</h3></a>

   This option was used for experimentation around IP-layer encryption.
   No products are known to ever have shipped with support for this
   option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5"><h3>2.5   VISA</h3></a>

   This option was part of an experiment [VISA87] [VISA89] at USC and
   was never widely deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.6"><h3>2.6   Address Extension</h3></a>

   The Address Extension option is defined in an Experimental RFC
   [RFC1475] and marked as IPv7.  IPv7 was never widely deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.7"><h3>2.7   Selective Directed Broadcast</h3></a>

   The Selective Directed Broadcast option was originally defined in
   [RFC1770].  This option was never widely deployed and the approach
   was abandoned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.8"><h3>2.8   Dynamic Packet State</h3></a>

   The Dynamic Packet State option was specified in [DIFFSERV-DPS].  The
   aforementioned document was meant to be published as Experimental,
   but it never became an RFC.  The IP option was never widely deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.9"><h3>2.9   Upstream Multicast Pkt.</h3></a>

   This option was originally specified in [BIDIR-PIM].  Its use was
   deprecated by [RFC5015], which employs a control-plane mechanism to
   solve the problem of doing upstream forwarding of multicast packets
   on a multi-access LAN.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   The "IP OPTION NUMBERS" registry [IANA-IP] contains the list of
   currently assigned IP option numbers.  This registry also denotes a
   deprecated IP Option Number by marking it with a footnote.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document formally deprecates the following options.  IANA has
   marked them as such in the corresponding registry [IANA-IP].

   The IP options "MTU Probe" (MTUP, value 11) and "MTU Reply" (MTUR,
   value 12) were initially defined in [RFC1063] and have already been
   deprecated by [RFC1191].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Changing the Status of the Corresponding RFCs to Historic</h2></a>

   Per this document, the RFC Editor has changed the status of
   [RFC1385], [RFC1393], [RFC1475], and [RFC1770] to Historic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document does not modify the security properties of the IPv4
   options being deprecated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Acknowledgments</h2></a>

   The authors would like to thank Ron Bonica for his guidance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The authors would like to thank Ran Atkinson, Fred Baker, Deborah
   Estrin, Dino Farinacci, Andrew Malis, Gene Tsudik, and Bill VerSteeg
   for providing insights on some of the options being formally
   deprecated by this document.
