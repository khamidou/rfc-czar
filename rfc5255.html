</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) version 4rev1 has basic
   support for non-ASCII characters in mailbox names and search
   substrings.  It also supports non-ASCII message headers and content
   encoded as specified by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).
   This specification defines a collection of IMAP extensions that
   improve international support including language negotiation for
   international error text, translations for namespace prefixes, and
   comparator negotiation for search, sort, and thread.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This specification defines two IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] extensions to
   enhance international support.  These extensions can be advertised
   and implemented separately.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LANGUAGE extension allows the client to request a suitable
   language for protocol error messages and in combination with the
   NAMESPACE extension [RFC2342] enables namespace translations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The I18NLEVEL=2 extension allows the client to request a suitable
   collation that will modify the behavior of the base specification's
   SEARCH command as well as the SORT and THREAD extensions [SORT].
   This leverages the collation registry [RFC4790].  The I18NLEVEL=1
   extension updates SEARCH/SORT/THREAD to use i;unicode-casemap
   comparator, as defined in [UCM].  I18NLEVEL=1 is a simpler version of
   I18NLEVEL=2 with no ability to select a different collation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The UTF-8-related productions are defined in [RFC3629].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   LANGUAGE Extension</h2></a>

   IMAP allows server responses to include human-readable text that in
   many cases needs to be presented to the user.  But that text is
   limited to US-ASCII by the IMAP specification [RFC3501] in order to
   preserve backwards compatibility with deployed IMAP implementations.
   This section specifies a way for an IMAP client to negotiate which
   language the server should use when sending human-readable text.
   The LANGUAGE extension only provides a mechanism for altering fixed
   server strings such as response text and NAMESPACE folder names.
   Assigning localized language aliases to shared mailboxes would be
   done with a separate mechanism such as the proposed METADATA
   extension (see [METADATA]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   LANGUAGE Extension Requirements</h3></a>

   IMAP servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword
   LANGUAGE in their CAPABILITY response as well as in the greeting
   CAPABILITY data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that advertises this extension MUST use the language
   "i-default" as described in [RFC2277] as its default language until
   another supported language is negotiated by the client.  A server
   MUST include "i-default" as one of its supported languages.  IMAP
   servers SHOULD NOT advertise the LANGUAGE extension if they discover
   that they only support "i-default".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Clients and servers that support this extension MUST also support the
   NAMESPACE extension [RFC2342].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LANGUAGE command is valid in all states.  Clients SHOULD issue
   LANGUAGE before authentication, since some servers send valuable user
   information as part of authentication (e.g., "password is correct,
   but expired").  If a security layer (such as SASL or TLS) is
   subsequently negotiated by the client, it MUST re-issue the LANGUAGE
   command in order to make sure that no previous active attack (if any)
   on LANGUAGE negotiation has effect on subsequent error messages.
   (See Section 7 for a more detailed explanation of the attack.)

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   LANGUAGE Command</h3></a>

   Arguments: Optional language range arguments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Response:  A possible LANGUAGE response (see Section 3.3).
              A possible NAMESPACE response (see Section 3.4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Result:    OK - Command completed
              NO - Could not complete command
              BAD - Arguments invalid

   The LANGUAGE command requests that human-readable text emitted by the
   server be localized to a language matching one of the language range
   argument as described by Section 2 of [RFC4647].
   If the command succeeds, the server will return human-readable
   responses in the first supported language specified.  These responses
   will be in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  The server MUST send a LANGUAGE response
   specifying the language used, and the change takes effect immediately
   after the LANGUAGE response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the command fails, the server continues to return human-readable
   responses in the language it was previously using.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The special "default" language range argument indicates a request to
   use a language designated as preferred by the server administrator.
   The preferred language MAY vary based on the currently active user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a language range does not match a known language tag exactly but
   does match a language by the rules of [RFC4647], the server MUST send
   an untagged LANGUAGE response indicating the language selected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If there aren't any arguments, the server SHOULD send an untagged
   LANGUAGE response listing the languages it supports.  If the server
   is unable to enumerate the list of languages it supports it MAY
   return a tagged NO response to the enumeration request.  If, after
   receiving a LANGUAGE request, the server discovers that it doesn't
   support any language other than i-default, it MUST return a tagged NO
   response to the enumeration request.

   Contents:  A list of one or more language tags.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LANGUAGE response occurs as a result of a LANGUAGE command.  A
   LANGUAGE response with a list containing a single language tag
   indicates that the server is now using that language.  A LANGUAGE
   response with a list containing multiple language tags indicates the
   server is communicating a list of available languages to the client,
   and no change in the active language has been made.
	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   TRANSLATION Extension to the NAMESPACE Response</h3></a>

   If localized representations of the namespace prefixes are available
   in the selected language, the server SHOULD include these in the
   TRANSLATION extension to the NAMESPACE response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The TRANSLATION extension to the NAMESPACE response returns a single
   string, containing the modified UTF-7 [RFC3501] encoded translation
   of the namespace prefix.  It is the responsibility of the client to
   convert between the namespace prefix and the translation of the
   namespace prefix when presenting mailbox names to the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this example, a server supports the IMAP4 NAMESPACE command.  It
   uses no prefix to the user's Personal Namespace, a prefix of "Other
   Users" to its Other Users' Namespace, and a prefix of "Public
   Folders" to its only Shared Namespace.  Since a client will often
   display these prefixes to the user, the server includes a translation
   of them that can be presented to the user.

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   I18NLEVEL=1 and I18NLEVEL=2 Extensions</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Introduction and Overview</h3></a>

   IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] includes the SEARCH command that can be used to
   locate messages matching criteria including human-readable text.  The
   SORT extension [SORT] to IMAP allows the client to ask the server to
   determine the order of messages based on criteria including human-
   readable text.  These mechanisms require the ability to support non-
   English search and sort functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 4 defines two IMAP extensions for internationalizing IMAP
   SEARCH, SORT, and THREAD [SORT] using the comparator framework
   [RFC4790].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The I18NLEVEL=1 extension updates SEARCH/SORT/THREAD to use
   i;unicode-casemap comparator, as defined in [UCM].  See Sections 4.2
   and 4.3 for more details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The I18NLEVEL=2 extension is a superset of the I18NLEVEL=1 extension.
   It adds to I18NLEVEL=1 extension the ability to determine the active
   comparator (see definition below) and to negotiate use of comparators
   using the COMPARATOR command.  It also adds the COMPARATOR response
   that indicates the active comparator and possibly other available
   comparators.  See Sections 4.2 and 4.4 for more details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Requirements Common to Both I18NLEVEL=1 and I18NLEVEL=2</h3></a>

   The term "default comparator" refers to the comparator that is used
   by SEARCH and SORT absent any negotiation using the COMPARATOR
   command (see Section 4.7).  The term "active comparator" refers to
   the comparator which will be used within a session, e.g., by SEARCH
   and SORT.  The COMPARATOR command is used to change the active
   comparator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The active comparator applies to the following SEARCH keys: "BCC",
   "BODY", "CC", "FROM", "SUBJECT", "TEXT", "TO", and "HEADER".  If the
   server also advertises the "SORT" extension, then the active
   comparator applies to the following SORT keys: "CC", "FROM",
   "SUBJECT", and "TO".  If the server advertises THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT,
   then the active comparator applies to the ORDEREDSUBJECT threading
   algorithm.  If the server advertises THREAD=REFERENCES, then the
   active comparator applies to the subject field comparisons done by
   REFERENCES threading algorithm.  Future extensions may choose to
   apply the active comparator to their SEARCH keys.
   For SORT and THREAD, the pre-processing necessary to extract the base
   subject text from a Subject header occurs prior to the application of
   a comparator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that advertises I18NLEVEL=1 or I18NLEVEL=2 extension MUST
   implement the i;unicode-casemap comparator, as defined in [UCM].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that advertises I18NLEVEL=1 or I18NLEVEL=2 extension MUST
   support UTF-8 as a SEARCH charset.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   I18NLEVEL=1 Extension Requirements</h3></a>

   An IMAP server that satisfies all requirements specified in Sections
   4.2 and 4.6 (and that doesn't support/advertise any other
   I18NLEVEL=<n> extension, where n > 1) MUST list the keyword
   I18NLEVEL=1 in its CAPABILITY data once IMAP enters the authenticated
   state, and MAY list that keyword in other states.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   I18NLEVEL=2 Extension Requirements</h3></a>

   An IMAP server that satisfies all requirements specified in Sections
   4.2, 4.4, and 4.6-4.10 (and that doesn't support/advertise any other
   I18NLEVEL=<n> extension, where n > 2) MUST list the keyword
   I18NLEVEL=2 in its CAPABILITY data once IMAP enters the authenticated
   state, and MAY list that keyword in other states.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that advertises this extension MUST implement the
   i;unicode-casemap comparator, as defined in [UCM].  It MAY implement
   other comparators from the IANA registry established by [RFC4790].
   See also Section 4.5 of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that advertises this extension SHOULD use i;unicode-casemap
   as the default comparator.  (Note that i;unicode-casemap is the
   default comparator for I18NLEVEL=1, but not necessarily the default
   for I18NLEVEL=2.) The selection of the default comparator MAY be
   adjustable by the server administrator, and MAY be sensitive to the
   current user.  Once the IMAP connection enters authenticated state,
   the default comparator MUST remain static for the remainder of that
   connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that since SEARCH uses the substring operation, IMAP servers can
   only implement collations that offer the substring operation (see
   [RFC4790], Section 4.2.2).  Since SORT uses the ordering operation
   (which in turn uses the equality operation), IMAP servers that
   advertise the SORT extension can only implement collations that offer
   all three operations (see [RFC4790], Sections 4.2.2-4.2.4).
   If the active collation does not provide the operations needed by an
   IMAP command, the server MUST respond with a tagged BAD.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Compatibility Notes</h3></a>

   Several server implementations deployed prior to the publication of
   this specification comply with I18NLEVEL=1 (see Section 4.3), but do
   not advertise that.  Other legacy servers use the i;ascii-casemap
   comparator (see [RFC4790]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no good way for a client to know which comparator a legacy
   server uses.  If the client has to assume the worst, it may end up
   doing expensive local operations to obtain i;unicode-casemap
   comparisons even though the server implements it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Legacy server implementations which comply with I18NLEVEL=1 should be
   updated to advertise I18NLEVEL=1.  All server implementations should
   eventually be updated to comply with the I18NLEVEL=2 extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   Comparators and Character Encodings</h3></a>

   RFC 3501, Section 6.4.4, says:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         In all search keys that use strings, a message matches the key
         if the string is a substring of the field.  The matching is
         case-insensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When performing the SEARCH operation, the active comparator is
   applied instead of the case-insensitive matching specified above.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An IMAP server which performs collation operations (e.g., as part of
   commands such as SEARCH, SORT, and THREAD) does so according to the
   following procedure:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (a) MIME encoding (for example, see [RFC2047] for headers and
       [RFC2045] for body parts) MUST be removed in the texts being
       collated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       If MIME encoding removal fails for a message (e.g., a body part
       of the message has an unsupported Content-Transfer-Encoding, uses
       characters not allowed by the Content-Transfer-Encoding, etc.),
       the collation of this message is undefined by this specification,
       and is handled in an implementation-dependent manner.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (b) The decoded text from (a) MUST be converted to the charset
       expected by the active comparator.
   (c) For the substring operation:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       If step (b) failed (e.g., the text is in an unknown charset,
       contains a sequence that is not valid according in that charset,
       etc.), the original decoded text from (a) (i.e., before the
       charset conversion attempt) is collated using the i;octet
       comparator (see [RFC4790]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       If step (b) was successful, the converted text from (b) is
       collated according to the active comparator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       For the ordering operation:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       All strings that were successfully converted by step (b) are
       separated from all strings that failed step (b).  Strings in each
       group are collated independently.  All strings successfully
       converted by step (b) are then validated by the active
       comparator.  Strings that pass validation are collated using the
       active comparator.  All strings that either fail step (b) or fail
       the active collation's validity operation are collated (after
       applying step (a)) using the i;octet comparator (see [RFC4790]).
       The resulting sorted list is produced by appending all collated
       "failed" strings after all strings collated using the active
       comparator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       Example: The following example demonstrates ordering of 4
       different strings using the i;unicode-casemap [UCM] comparator.
       Strings are represented using hexadecimal notation used by ABNF

           %xD0 %xB8 %xFF %xB9 (labeled with charset=UTF-8)
       (4) %xE1 %xCC %xC5 %xCB %xD3 %xC5 %xCA (labeled with<br>
           charset=KOI8-R)

       Step (b) will convert string (4) to the following sequence of<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       %xD0 %x90 %xD0 %xBB %xD0 %xB5 %xD0 %xBA %xD1 %x81 %xD0
       %xB5 %xD0 %xB9

       and will reject strings (1) and (3), as they contain octets not<br>
       allowed in charset=UTF-8.
       After that, using the i;unicode-casemap collation, string (4)
       will collate before string (2).  Using the i;octet collation on<br>
       the original strings, string (3) will collate before string (1).<br>
       So the final ordering is as follows: (4) (2) (3) (1).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the substring operation (e.g., IMAP SEARCH) of the active
   comparator returns the "undefined" result (see Section 4.2.3 of

   (a) using the i;octet comparator.

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Other IMAP Internationalization Issues</h2></a>

   The following sections provide an overview of various other IMAP
   internationalization issues.  These issues are not resolved by this
   specification, but could be resolved by other standards work, such as
   that being done by the EAI working group (see [IMAP-EAI]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Unicode Userids and Passwords</h3></a>

   IMAP4rev1 currently restricts the userid and password fields of the
   LOGIN command to US-ASCII.  The "userid" and "password" fields of the
   IMAP LOGIN command are restricted to US-ASCII only until a future
   standards track RFC states otherwise.  Servers are encouraged to
   validate both fields to make sure they conform to the formal syntax
   of UTF-8 and to reject the LOGIN command if that syntax is violated.
   Servers MAY reject the LOGIN command if either the "userid" or
   "password" field contains an octet with the highest bit set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When AUTHENTICATE is used, some servers may support userids and
   passwords in Unicode [RFC3490] since SASL (see [RFC4422]) allows
   that.  However, such userids cannot be used as part of email
   addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   UTF-8 Mailbox Names</h3></a>

   The modified UTF-7 mailbox naming convention described in Section
   5.1.3 of RFC 3501 is best viewed as an transition from the status quo
   in 1996 when modified UTF-7 was first specified.  At that time, there
   was widespread unofficial use of local character sets such as ISO-
   8859-1 and Shift-JIS for non-ASCII mailbox names, with resultant
   non-interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The requirements in Section 5.1 of RFC 3501 are very important if
   we're ever going to be able to deploy UTF-8 mailbox names.  Servers
   are encouraged to enforce them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   UTF-8 Domains, Addresses, and Mail Headers</h3></a>

   There is now an IETF standard for "Internationalizing Domain Names in
   Applications (IDNA)" [RFC3490].  While IMAP clients are free to
   support this standard, an argument can be made that it would be
   helpful to simple clients if the IMAP server could perform this
   conversion (the same argument would apply to MIME header encoding
   [RFC2047]).  However, it would be unwise to move forward with such
   work until the work in progress to define the format of international
   email addresses is complete.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA added LANGUAGE, I18NLEVEL=1, and I18NLEVEL=2 to the IMAP4
   Capabilities Registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The LANGUAGE extension makes a new command available in "Not
   Authenticated" state in IMAP.  Some IMAP implementations run with
   root privilege when the server is in "Not Authenticated" state and do
   not revoke that privilege until after authentication is complete.
   Such implementations are particularly vulnerable to buffer overflow
   security errors at this stage and need to implement parsing of this
   command with extra care.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A LANGUAGE command issued prior to activation of a security layer is
   subject to an active attack that suppresses or modifies the
   negotiation, and thus makes STARTTLS or authentication error messages
   more difficult to interpret.  This is not a new attack as the error
   messages themselves are subject to active attack.  Clients MUST re-
   issue the LANGUAGE command once a security layer is active, in order
   to prevent this attack from impacting subsequent protocol operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   LANGUAGE, I18NLEVEL=1, and I18NLEVEL=2 extensions use the UTF-8
   charset; thus, the security considerations for UTF-8 [RFC3629] are
   relevant.  However, neither uses UTF-8 for identifiers, so the most
   serious concerns do not apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Acknowledgements</h2></a>

   The LANGUAGE extension is based on a previous document by Mike
   Gahrns, a substantial portion of the text in that section was written
   by him.  Many people have participated in discussions about an IMAP
   Language extension in the various fora of the IETF and Internet
   working groups, so any list of contributors is bound to be
   incomplete.  However, the authors would like to thank Andrew McCown
   for early work on the original proposal, John Myers for suggestions
   regarding the namespace issue, along with Jutta Degener, Mark
   Crispin, Mark Pustilnik, Larry Osterman, Cyrus Daboo, Martin Duerst,
   Timo Sirainen, Ben Campbell, and Magnus Nystrom for their many
   suggestions that have been incorporated into this document.
