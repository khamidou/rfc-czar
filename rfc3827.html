</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   The snoop file format provides a way to store and exchange datalink
   layer packet traces.  This document describes extensions to this file
   format to support new media.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   [RFC1761] defines the snoop file format used to store captured
   network packets for tools that capture, display, and interpret
   network traffic.  The file format specifies a header containing the
   Datalink Type field that identifies the network's datalink type.
   This document defines new values for this field, as well as an IANA
   registry for future datalink types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   New Datalink Types</h2></a>

   In addition to the Datalink Type codes listed in [RFC1761], this
   document defines the following type codes for the corresponding
   media:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             Datalink Type           Code
             -------------           ----

             Fibre Channel           16
             ATM                     17
             ATM Classical IP        18
             IP over Infiniband      26

   The IP over Infiniband packet format is described in [IPoIB].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document created a new IANA registry named "Snoop Datalink
   Types" to hold the various possible 32-bit (4 octet) snoop datalink
   types.  This new registry holds the values previously defined in
   [RFC1761] and tabulated below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             Datalink Type           Code
             -------------           ----

             IEEE 802.3              0
             IEEE 802.4 Token Bus    1
             IEEE 802.5 Token Ring   2
             IEEE 802.6 Metro Net    3
             Ethernet                4
             HDLC                    5
             Character Synchronous   6
             IBM Channel-to-Channel  7
             FDDI                    8
             Other                   9

   Additionally, the new registry also holds the values defined above in
   section 2 of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All new allocations and assignments to this registry starting from
   code 27 will follow the First Come First Served policy outlined in
   [BCP0026].  Type codes up to 26 not defined by this section of the
   document (10-15 and 19-25) are considered reserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The addition of new datalink type codes to the existing file format
   poses no known security risks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Acknowledgements</h2></a>

   The author would like to thank Jim Carlson, Brent Callaghan, and Bill
   Strahm for meticulously reviewing this document.
