	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   A management system contains:  several (potentially many) nodes, each
   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
   management protocol, used to convey management information between
   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are
   carried out under an administrative framework which defines
   authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
   control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as
   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and
   controlled via access to their management information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Administrative Infrastructure for SNMPv2 document [1] defines an
   administrative framework which realizes effective management in a
   variety of configurations and environments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this administrative framework, a security model defines the
   mechanisms used to achieve an administratively-defined level of
   security for protocol interactions.  Although many such security
   models might be defined, it is the purpose of this document, User-
   based Security Model for SNMPv2, to define the first, and, as of this
   writing, only, security model for this administrative framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This administrative framework includes the provision of an access
   control model.  The enforcement of access rights requires the means
   to identify the entity on whose behalf a request is generated.  This
   SNMPv2 security model identifies an entity on whose behalf an SNMPv2
   message is generated as a "user".
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Threats</h3></a>

   Several of the classical threats to network protocols are applicable
   to the network management problem and therefore would be applicable
   to any SNMPv2 security model.  Other threats are not applicable to
   the network management problem.  This section discusses principal
   threats, secondary threats, and threats which are of lesser
   importance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The principal threats against which this SNMPv2 security model should
   provide protection are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Modification of Information
     The modification threat is the danger that some unauthorized entity
     may alter in-transit SNMPv2 messages generated on behalf of an
     authorized user in such a way as to effect unauthorized management
     operations, including falsifying the value of an object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Masquerade
     The masquerade threat is the danger that management operations not
     authorized for some user may be attempted by assuming the identity
     of another user that has the appropriate authorizations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two secondary threats are also identified.  The security protocols
   defined in this memo do provide protection against:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Message Stream Modification
     The SNMPv2 protocol is typically based upon a connectionless
     transport service which may operate over any subnetwork service.
     The re-ordering, delay or replay of messages can and does occur
     through the natural operation of many such subnetwork services.
     The message stream modification threat is the danger that messages
     may be maliciously re-ordered, delayed or replayed to an extent
     which is greater than can occur through the natural operation of a
     subnetwork service, in order to effect unauthorized management
     operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Disclosure
     The disclosure threat is the danger of eavesdropping on the
     exchanges between managed agents and a management station.
     Protecting against this threat may be required as a matter of local
     policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are at least two threats that an SNMPv2 security protocol need
   not protect against.  The security protocols defined in this memo do
   not provide protection against:
Denial of Service
     An SNMPv2 security protocol need not attempt to address the broad
     range of attacks by which service on behalf of authorized users is
     denied.  Indeed, such denial-of-service attacks are in many cases
     indistinguishable from the type of network failures with which any
     viable network management protocol must cope as a matter of course.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Traffic Analysis
     In addition, an SNMPv2 security protocol need not attempt to
     address traffic analysis attacks.  Indeed, many traffic patterns
     are predictable - agents may be managed on a regular basis by a
     relatively small number of management stations - and therefore
     there is no significant advantage afforded by protecting against
     traffic analysis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Goals and Constraints</h3></a>

   Based on the foregoing account of threats in the SNMP network
   management environment, the goals of this SNMPv2 security model are
   as follows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(1)  The protocol should provide for verification that each received<br>
     SNMPv2 message has not been modified during its transmission
     through the network in such a way that an unauthorized management
     operation might result.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(2)  The protocol should provide for verification of the identity of the<br>
     user on whose behalf a received SNMPv2 message claims to have been
     generated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(3)  The protocol should provide for detection of received SNMPv2<br>
     messages, which request or contain management information, whose
     time of generation was not recent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(4)  The protocol should provide, when necessary, that the contents of<br>
     each received SNMPv2 message are protected from disclosure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to the principal goal of supporting secure network
   management, the design of this SNMPv2 security model is also
   influenced by the following constraints:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(1)  When the requirements of effective management in times of network<br>
     stress are inconsistent with those of security, the design should
     prefer the former.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(2)  Neither the security protocol nor its underlying security<br>
     mechanisms should depend upon the ready availability of other
     network services (e.g., Network Time Protocol (NTP) or key
     management protocols).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(3)  A security mechanism should entail no changes to the basic SNMP<br>
     network management philosophy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   Security Services</h3></a>

   The security services necessary to support the goals of an SNMPv2
   security model are as follows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Data Integrity
     is the provision of the property that data has not been altered or
     destroyed in an unauthorized manner, nor have data sequences been
     altered to an extent greater than can occur non-maliciously.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Data Origin Authentication
     is the provision of the property that the claimed identity of the
     user on whose behalf received data was originated is corroborated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Data Confidentiality
     is the provision of the property that information is not made
     available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or
     processes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the protocols specified in this memo, it is not possible to
   assure the specific originator of a received SNMPv2 message; rather,
   it is the user on whose behalf the message was originated that is
   authenticated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For these protocols, it not possible to obtain data integrity without
   data origin authentication, nor is it possible to obtain data origin
   authentication without data integrity.  Further, there is no
   provision for data confidentiality without both data integrity and
   data origin authentication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The security protocols used in this memo are considered acceptably
   secure at the time of writing.  However, the procedures allow for new
   authentication and privacy methods to be specified at a future time
   if the need arises.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4"><h3>1.4   Mechanisms</h3></a>

   The security protocols defined in this memo employ several types of
   mechanisms in order to realize the goals and security services
   described above:
  -  In support of data integrity, a message digest algorithm is
     required.  A digest is calculated over an appropriate portion of an
     SNMPv2 message and included as part of the message sent to the
     recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  In support of data origin authentication and data integrity, a
     secret value is both inserted into, and appended to, the SNMPv2
     message prior to computing the digest; the inserted value
     overwritten prior to transmission, and the appended value is not
     transmitted.  The secret value is shared by all SNMPv2 entities
     authorized to originate messages on behalf of the appropriate user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  To protect against the threat of message delay or replay (to an
     extent greater than can occur through normal operation), a set of
     time (at the agent) indicators and a request-id are included in
     each message generated.  An SNMPv2 agent evaluates the time
     indicators to determine if a received message is recent.  An SNMPv2
     manager evaluates the time indicators to ensure that a received
     message is at least as recent as the last message it received from
     the same source.  An SNMPv2 manager uses received authentic
     messages to advance its notion of time (at the agent).  An  SNMPv2
     manager also evaluates the request-id in received Response messages
     and discards messages which do not correspond to outstanding
     requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     These mechanisms provide for the detection of messages whose time
     of generation was not recent in all but one circumstance; this
     circumstance is the delay or replay of a Report  message (sent to a
     manager) when the manager has has not recently communicated with
     the source of the Report message.  In this circumstance, the
     detection guarantees only that the Report message is more recent
     than the last communication between source and destination of the
     Report message.  However, Report messages do not request or contain
     management information, and thus, goal #3 in Section 1.2 above is
     met; further, Report messages can at most cause the manager to
     advance its notion of time (at the agent) by less than the proper
     amount.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     This protection against the threat of message delay or replay does
     not imply nor provide any protection against unauthorized deletion
     or suppression of messages.  Other mechanisms defined independently
     of the security protocol can also be used to detect the re-
     ordering, replay, deletion, or suppression of messages containing
     set operations (e.g., the MIB variable snmpSetSerialNo [15]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  In support of data confidentiality, an encryption algorithm is
     required.  An appropriate portion of the message is encrypted prior
     to being transmitted.
	<a name="section-1.4.1"><h4>1.4.1   Digest Authentication Protocol</h4></a>

   The Digest Authentication Protocol defined in this memo provides for:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  verifying the integrity of a received message (i.e., the message
     received is the message sent).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     The integrity of the message is protected by computing a digest
     over an appropriate portion of a message.  The digest is computed
     by the originator of the message, transmitted with the message, and
     verified by the recipient of the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  verifying the user on whose behalf the message was generated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     A secret value known only to SNMPv2 entities authorized to generate
     messages on behalf of this user is both inserted into, and appended
     to, the message prior to the digest computation.  Thus, the
     verification of the user is implicit with the verification of the
     digest.  (Note that the use of two copies of the secret, one near
     the start and one at the end, is recommended by [14].)

  -  verifying that a message sent to/from one SNMPv2 entity cannot be
     replayed to/as-if-from another SNMPv2 entity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Included in each message is an identifier unique to the SNMPv2
     agent associated with the sender or intended recipient of the
     message.  Also, each message containing a Response PDU contains a
     request-id which associates the message to a recently generated
     request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     A Report message sent by one SNMPv2 agent to one SNMPv2 manager can
     potentially be replayed to another SNMPv2 manager.  However, Report
     messages do not request or contain management information, and
     thus, goal #3 in Section 1.2 above is met; further, Report messages
     can at most cause the manager to advance its notion of time (at the
     agent) by less than the correct amount.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  detecting messages which were not recently generated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     A set of time indicators are included in the message, indicating
     the time of generation.  Messages (other than those containing
     Report PDUs) without recent time indicators are not considered
     authentic.  In addition, messages containing Response PDUs have a
     request-id; if the request-id does not match that of a recently
     generated request, then the message is not considered to be
     authentic.
     A Report message sent by an SNMPv2 agent can potentially be
     replayed at a later time to an SNMPv2 manager which has not
     recently communicated with that agent.  However, Report messages do
     not request or contain management information, and thus, goal #3 in
     Section 1.2 above is met; further, Report messages can at most
     cause the manager to advance its notion of time (at the agent) by
     less than the correct amount.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This protocol uses the MD5 [3] message digest algorithm.  A 128-bit
   digest is calculated over the designated portion of an SNMPv2 message
   and included as part of the message sent to the recipient.  The size
   of both the digest carried in a message and the private
   authentication key is 16 octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo allows the same user to be defined on multiple SNMPv2
   agents and managers.  Each SNMPv2 agent maintains a value, agentID,
   which uniquely identifies the agent. This value is included in each
   message sent to/from that agent.  Messages sent from a SNMPv2 dual-
   role entity [1] to a SNMPv2 manager include the agentID value
   maintained by the dual-role entity's agent.  On receipt of a message,
   an agent checks the value to ensure it is the intended recipient, and
   a manager uses the value to ensure that the message is processed
   using the correct state information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each SNMPv2 agent maintains two values, agentBoots and agentTime,
   which taken together provide an indication of time at that agent.
   Both of these values are included in an authenticated message sent
   to/received from that agent.  Authenticated messages sent from a
   SNMPv2 dual-role entity to a SNMPv2 manager include the agentBoots
   and agentTime values maintained by the dual-role entity's agent.  On
   receipt, the values are checked to ensure that the indicated time is
   within a time window of the current time.  The time window represents
   an administrative upper bound on acceptable delivery delay for
   protocol messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For an SNMPv2 manager to generate a message which an agent will
   accept as authentic, and to verify that a message received from that
   agent is authentic, that manager must first achieve time
   synchronization with that agent.  Similarly, for a manger to verify
   that a message received from an SNMPv2 dual-role entity is authentic,
   that manager must first achieve time synchronization with the dual-
   role entity's agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4.2"><h4>1.4.2   Symmetric Encryption Protocol</h4></a>

   The Symmetric Encryption Protocol defined in this memo provides
   support for data confidentiality through the use of the Data
   Encryption Standard (DES) in the Cipher Block Chaining mode of
   operation.  The designated portion of an SNMPv2 message is encrypted
   and included as part of the message sent to the recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two organizations have published specifications defining the DES: the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [5] and the
   American National Standards Institute [6].  There is a companion
   Modes of Operation specification for each definition (see [7] and
   [8], respectively).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NIST has published three additional documents that implementors
   may find useful.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  There is a document with guidelines for implementing and using the
     DES, including functional specifications for the DES and its modes
     of operation [9].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  There is a specification of a validation test suite for the DES
     [10].  The suite is designed to test all aspects of the DES and is
     useful for pinpointing specific problems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  There is a specification of a maintenance test for the DES [11].
     The test utilizes a minimal amount of data and processing to test
     all components of the DES.  It provides a simple yes-or-no
     indication of correct operation and is useful to run as part of an
     initialization step, e.g., when a computer reboots.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This Symmetric Encryption Protocol specifies that the size of the
   privacy key is 16 octets, of which the first 8 octets are a DES key
   and the second 8 octets are a DES Initialization Vector.  The 64-bit
   DES key in the first 8 octets of the private key is a 56 bit quantity
   used directly by the algorithm plus 8 parity bits - arranged so that
   one parity bit is the least significant bit of each octet.  The
   setting of the parity bits is ignored by this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The length of an octet sequence to be encrypted by the DES must be an
   integral multiple of 8.  When encrypting, the data is padded at the
   end as necessary; the actual pad value is irrelevant.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the length of the octet sequence to be decrypted is not an
   integral multiple of 8 octets, the processing of the octet sequence
   is halted and an appropriate exception noted.  When decrypting, the
   padding is ignored.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Elements of the Model</h2></a>

   This section contains definitions required to realize the security
   model defined by this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   SNMPv2 Users</h3></a>

   Management operations using this security model make use of a defined
   set of user identities.  For any SNMPv2 user on whose behalf
   management operations are authorized at a particular SNMPv2 agent,
   that agent must have knowledge of that user.  A SNMPv2 manager that
   wishes to communicate with a particular agent must also have
   knowledge of a user known to that agent, including knowledge of the
   applicable attributes of that user.  Similarly, a SNMPv2 manager that
   wishes to receive messages from a SNMPv2 dual-role entity must have
   knowledge of the user on whose behalf the dual-role entity sends the
   message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A user and its attributes are defined as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><userName>
     An octet string representing the name of the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><authProtocol>
     An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of this user can
     be authenticated, and if so, the type of authentication protocol
     which is used.  One such protocol is defined in this memo: the
     Digest Authentication Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><authPrivateKey>
     If messages sent on behalf of this user can be authenticated, the
     (private) authentication key for use with the authentication
     protocol.  Note that a user's authentication key will normally be
     different at different agents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><privProtocol>
     An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of this user can
     be protected from disclosure, and if so, the type of privacy
     protocol which is used.  One such protocol is defined in this memo:
     the Symmetric Encryption Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><privPrivateKey>
     If messages sent on behalf of this user can be protected from
     disclosure, the (private) privacy key for use with the privacy
     protocol.  Note that a user's privacy key will normally be
     different at different agents.
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Contexts and Context Selectors</h3></a>

   An SNMPv2 context is a collection of management information
   accessible (locally or via proxy) by an SNMPv2 agent.  An item of
   management information may exist in more than one context.  An SNMPv2
   agent potentially has access to many contexts.  Each SNMPv2 message
   contains a context selector which unambiguously identifies an SNMPv2
   context accessible by the SNMPv2 agent to which the message is
   directed or by the SNMPv2 agent associated with the sender of the
   message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a local SNMPv2 context which is realized by an SNMPv2 entity,
   that SNMPv2 entity uses locally-defined mechanisms to access the
   management information identified by the SNMPv2 context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a proxy SNMPv2 context, the SNMPv2 entity acts as a proxy SNMPv2
   agent to access the management information identified by the SNMPv2
   context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The term remote SNMPv2 context is used at an SNMPv2 manager to

   realized by the local SNMPv2 entity (i.e., the local SNMPv2 entity

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Proxy SNMPv2 contexts are further categorized as either local-proxy
   contexts or remote-proxy contexts.  A proxy SNMPv2 agent receives

   and Inform operations for a remote-proxy context, and forwards them
   with a local-proxy context; for Response operations, a proxy SNMPv2
   agent receives them with either a local-proxy or remote-proxy
   context, and forwards them with a remote-proxy or local-proxy
   context, respectively.

   The combination of an agentID value and a context selector provides a

   associated with each agent which can access it. In the example above,
   "context-B" and "context-C" are different names for the same context.
	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Quality of Service (qoS)</h3></a>

   Messages are generated with a particular Quality of Service (qoS),
   either:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  without authentication and privacy,

  -  with authentication but not privacy,

  -  with authentication and privacy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All users are capable of having messages without authentication and
   privacy generated on their behalf.  Users having an authentication
   protocol and an authentication key can have messages with
   authentication but not privacy generated on their behalf. Users
   having an authentication protocol, an authentication key, a privacy
   protocol and a privacy key can have messages with authentication and
   privacy generated on their behalf.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to its indications of authentication and privacy, the qoS
   may also indicate that the message contains an operation that may
   result in a report PDU being generated (see Section 2.6 below).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Access Policy</h3></a>

   An administration's access policy determines the access rights of
   users.  For a particular SNMPv2 context to which a user has access
   using a particular qoS, that user's access rights are given by a list
   of authorized operations, and for a local context, a read-view and a
   write-view.  The read-view is the set of object instances authorized
   for the user when reading objects.  Reading objects occurs when
   processing a retrieval (get, get-next, get-bulk) operation and when
   sending a notification.  The write-view is the set of object
   instances authorized for the user when writing objects.  Writing
   objects occurs when processing a set operation.  A user's access
   rights may be different at different agents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5"><h3>2.5   Replay Protection</h3></a>

   Each SNMPv2 agent (or dual-role entity) maintains three objects:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  agentID, which is an identifier unique among all agents in (at
     least) an administrative domain;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  agentBoots, which is a count of the number of times the agent has
     rebooted/re-initialized since agentID was last configured; and,
  -  agentTime, which is the number of seconds since agentBoots was last
     incremented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An SNMPv2 agent is always authoritative with respect to these
   variables.  It is the responsibility of an SNMPv2 manager to
   synchronize with the agent, as appropriate.  In the case of an SNMPv2
   dual-role entity sending an Inform-Request, it is that entity acting
   in an agent role which is authoritative with respect to these
   variables for the Inform-Request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An agent is required to maintain the values of agentID and agentBoots
   in non-volatile storage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5.1"><h4>2.5.1   agentID</h4></a>

   The agentID value contained in an authenticated message is used to
   defeat attacks in which messages from a manager are replayed to a
   different agent and/or messages from one agent (or dual-role entity)
   are replayed as if from a different agent (or dual-role entity).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an agent (or dual-role entity) is first installed, it sets its
   local value of agentID according to a enterprise-specific algorithm
   (see the definition of agentID in Section 4.1).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5.2"><h4>2.5.2   agentBoots and agentTime</h4></a>

   The agentBoots and agentTime values contained in an authenticated
   message are used to defeat attacks in which messages are replayed
   when they are no longer valid.  Through use of agentBoots and
   agentTime, there is no requirement for an SNMPv2 agent to have a
   non-volatile clock which ticks (i.e., increases with the passage of
   time) even when the agent is powered off.  Rather, each time an
   SNMPv2 agent reboots, it retrieves, increments, and then stores
   agentBoots in non-volatile storage, and resets agentTime to zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an agent (or dual-role entity) is first installed, it sets its
   local values of agentBoots and agentTime to zero.  If agentTime ever
   reaches its maximum value (2147483647), then agentBoots is<br>
   incremented as if the agent has rebooted and agentTime is reset to
   zero and starts incrementing again.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each time an agent (or dual-role entity) reboots, any SNMPv2 managers
   holding that agent's values of agentBoots and agentTime need to re-
   synchronize prior to sending correctly authenticated messages to that
   agent (see Section 2.7 for re-synchronization procedures).  Note,
   however, that the procedures do provide for a notification to be
   accepted as authentic by a manager, when sent by an agent which has
   rebooted since the manager last re-synchronized.
   If an agent (or dual-role entity) is ever unable to determine its
   latest agentBoots value, then it must set its agentBoots value to
   0xffffffff.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Whenever the local value of agentBoots has the value 0xffffffff, it
   latches at that value and an authenticated message always causes an
   usecStatsNotInWindows authentication failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to reset an agent whose agentBoots value has reached the
   value 0xffffffff, manual intervention is required.  The agent must be
   physically visited and re-configured, either with a new agentID
   value, or with new secret values for the authentication and privacy
   keys of all users known to that agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5.3"><h4>2.5.3   Time Window</h4></a>

   The Time Window is a value that specifies the window of time in which
   a message generated on behalf of any user is valid.  This memo
   specifies that the same value of the Time Window, 150 seconds, is
   used for all users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.6"><h3>2.6   Error Reporting</h3></a>

   While processing a received communication, an SNMPv2 entity may
   determine that the message is unacceptable (see Section 3.2).  In
   this case, the appropriate counter from the snmpGroup [15] or
   usecStatsGroup object groups is incremented and the received message
   is discarded without further processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an SNMPv2 entity acting in the agent role makes such a
   determination and the qoS indicates that a report may be generated,
   then after incrementing the appropriate counter, it is required to
   generate a message containing a report PDU, with the same user and
   context as the received message, and to send it to the transport
   address which originated the received message.  For all report PDUs,
   except those generated due to incrementing the usecStatsNotInWindows
   counter, the report PDU is unauthenticated.  For those generated due
   to incrementing usecStatsNotInWindows, the report PDU is
   authenticated only if the received message was authenticated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The report flag in the qoS may only be set if the message contains a
   Get, GetNext, GetBulk, Set operation.  The report flag should never
   be set for a message that contains a Response, Inform, SNMPv2-Trap or
   Report operation.  Furthermore, a report PDU is never sent by an
   SNMPv2 entity acting in a manager role.
	<a name="section-2.7"><h3>2.7   Time Synchronization</h3></a>

   Time synchronization, required by a management entity in order to
   proceed with authentic communications, has occurred when the
   management entity has obtained local values of agentBoots and
   agentTime from the agent that are within the agent's time window.  To
   remain synchronized, the local values must remain within the agent's
   time window and thus must be kept loosely synchronized with the
   values stored at the agent.  In addition to keeping a local version
   of agentBoots and agentTime, a manager must also keep one other local
   variable, latestReceivedAgentTime.  This value records the highest
   value of agentTime that was received by the manager from the agent
   and is used to eliminate the possibility of replaying messages that
   would prevent the manager's notion of the agentTime from advancing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Time synchronization occurs as part of the procedures of receiving a
   message (Section 3.2, step 9d). As such, no explicit time
   synchronization procedure is required by a management entity.  Note,
   that whenever the local value of agentID is changed (e.g., through
   discovery) or when a new secret is configured, the local values of
   agentBoots and latestReceivedAgentTime should be set to zero. This
   will cause the time synchronization to occur when the next authentic
   message is received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.8"><h3>2.8   Proxy Error Propagation</h3></a>

   When a proxy SNMPv2 agent receives a report PDU from a proxied agent
   and it is determined that a proxy-forwarded request cannot be
   delivered to the proxied agent, then the snmpProxyDrops counter [15]
   is incremented and a report PDU is generated and transmitted to the
   transport address from which the original request was received.
   (Note that the receipt of a report PDU containing snmpProxyDrops as a
   VarBind, is included among the reasons why a proxy-forwarded request
   cannot be delivered.)

	<a name="section-2.9"><h3>2.9   SNMPv2 Messages Using this Model</h3></a>

   The syntax of an SNMPv2 message using this security model differs
   from that of an SNMPv1 [2] message as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The version component is changed to 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The data component contains either a PDU or an OCTET STRING
     containing an encrypted PDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SNMPv1 community string is now termed the "parameters" component
   and contains a set of administrative information for the message.
   Only the PDU is protected from disclosure by the privacy protocol.
   This exposes the administrative information to eavesdroppers.
   However, malicious use of this information is considered to be a
   Traffic Analysis attack against which protection is not provided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For an authenticated SNMPv2 message, the message digest is applied to
   the entire message given to the transport service.  As such, message
   generation first privatizes the PDU, then adds the message wrapper,
   and then authenticates the message.

   For the sake of clarity and to prevent the above procedure from being

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.2.1.1"><h4>3.2.1.1   ASN.1 Parsing Errors</h4></a>

   For ASN.1 parsing errors, the snmpInASNParseErrs counter [15] is
   incremented and a report PDU is generated whenever such an ASN.1
   parsing error is discovered.  However, if the parsing error causes
   the information able to be extracted from the message to be
   insufficient for generating a report PDU, then the report PDU is not
   sent.
<a name="section-3.2.1.2"><h4>3.2.1.2   Incorrectly Encoded Parameters</h4></a>

   For an incorrectly encoded parameters component of the Message value
   (e.g., incorrect or inconsistent value of the <userLen> or <authLen>
   fields), the usecStatsBadParameters counter is incremented. Since the
   encoded parameters are in error, the report flag in the qoS cannot be
   reliably determined. Thus, no report PDU is generated for the
   incorrectly encoded parameters error condition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.2.1.3"><h4>3.2.1.3   Generation of a Report PDU</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc1910.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   Some steps specify that the received message is discarded without
   further processing whenever a report PDU is generated.  However:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  An SNMPv2 manager never generates a report PDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  If the operation type can reliably be determined and it is
     determined to be a Report, SNMPv2-Trap, Inform, or a Response then
     a report PDU is not generated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  A report PDU is only generated when the report flag in the qoS is
     set to the value 1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A generated report PDU must always use the current values of agentID,
   agentBoots, and agentTime from the LCD.  In addition, a generated
   report PDU must whenever possible contain the same request-id value
   as in the PDU contained in the received message.  Meeting this
   constraint normally requires the message to be further processed just
   enough so as to extract its request-id. There are two situations in
   which the SNMPv2 request-id cannot be determined. The first situation
   occurs when the userName is unknown and the qoS indicates that the
   message is encrypted.  The other situation is when there is an ASN.1
   parsing error.  In cases where the the request-id cannot be
   determined, the default request-id value 2147483647 is used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.2.1.4"><h4>3.2.1.4   Cache Timeout</h4></a>

   Some steps specify that information is cached so that a Response
   operation may be correlated to the appropriate Request operation.
   However, a number of situations could cause the cache to grow without
   bound. One such situation is when the Response operation does not
   arrive or arrives "late" at the entity. In order to ensure that the
   cache does not grow without bound, it is recommended that cache
   entries be deleted when they are determined to be no longer valid. It
   is an implementation dependent decision as to how long cache entries
   remain valid, however, caching entries more than 150 seconds is not
   useful since any use of the cache entry after that time would
   generate a usecStatsNotInWindows error condition.
	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Generating a Response</h3></a>

   The procedure for generating a response to an SNMPv2 management
   request is identical to the procedure for transmitting a request (see
   Section 3.1), with these exceptions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The response is sent on behalf of the same user and with the same
     value of the agentID and contextSelector as the request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The PDUs value of the responding Message value is the response
     which results from performing the operation specified in the
     original PDUs value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The authentication protocol and other relevant information for the
     user is obtained, not from the LCD, but rather from information
     cached (in Step 13d) when processing the original message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The serialized Message value is transmitted using any transport
     address belonging to the agent for the transport domain from which
     the corresponding request originated - even if that is different
     from any transport information obtained from the LCD.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  If the qoS specifies that the message is to be authenticated or the
     response is being generated by a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent
     role, then the current values of agentBoots and agentTime from the
     LCD are used.  Otherwise, the <agentBoots> and <agentTime> fields
     are set to zero-filled octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The report flag in the qoS is set to the value 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Discovery</h2></a>

   This security model requires that a discovery process obtain
   sufficient information about an SNMPv2 entity's agent in order to
   communicate with it.  Discovery requires the SNMPv2 manager to learn
   the agent's agentID value before communication may proceed.  This may
   be accomplished by formulating a get-request communication with the
   qoS set to noAuth/noPriv, the userName set to "public", the agentID
   set to all zeros (binary), the contextSelector set to "", and the
   VarBindList left empty.  The response to this message will be an
   reportPDU that contains the agentID within the <parameters> field
   (and containing the usecStatsUnknownContexts counter in the
   VarBindList). If authenticated communication is required then the
   discovery process may invoke the procedure described in Section 2.7
   to synchronize the clocks.

            "An agent's administratively-unique identifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            The value for this object may not be all zeros or all 'ff'H.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            The initial value for this object may be configured via an
            operator console entry or via an algorithmic function.  In
            the later case, the following guidelines are recommended:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              1) The first four octets are set to the binary equivalent
                 of the agent's SNMP network management private
                 enterprise number as assigned by the Internet Assigned
                 Numbers Authority (IANA).  For example, if Acme
                 Networks has been assigned { enterprises 696 }, the
                 first four octets would be assigned '000002b8'H.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              2) The remaining eight octets are the cookie whose
                 contents are determined via one or more enterprise-
                 specific methods.  Such methods must be designed so as
                 to maximize the possibility that the value of this
                 object will be unique in the agent's administrative
                 domain.  For example, the cookie may be the IP address
                 of the agent, or the MAC address of one of the
                 interfaces, with each address suitably padded with
                 random octets.  If multiple methods are defined, then
                 it is recommended that the cookie be further divided
                 into one octet that indicates the method being used and
                 seven octets which are a function of the method."

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Recommended Practices</h3></a>

   This section describes practices that contribute to the secure,
   effective operation of the mechanisms defined in this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  A management station must discard SNMPv2 responses for which
     neither the request-id component nor the represented management
     information corresponds to any currently outstanding request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Although it would be typical for a management station to do this as
     a matter of course, when using these security protocols it is
     significant due to the possibility of message duplication
     (malicious or otherwise).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  A management station must generate unpredictable request-ids in
     authenticated messages in order to protect against the possibility
     of message duplication (malicious or otherwise).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  A management station should perform time synchronization using
     authenticated messages in order to protect against the possibility
     of message duplication (malicious or otherwise).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  When sending state altering messages to a managed agent, a
     management station should delay sending successive messages to the
     managed agent until a positive acknowledgement is received for the
     previous message or until the previous message expires.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     No message ordering is imposed by the SNMPv2. Messages may be
     received in any order relative to their time of generation and each
     will be processed in the ordered received. Note that when an
     authenticated message is sent to a managed agent, it will be valid
     for a period of time of approximately 150 seconds under normal
     circumstances, and is subject to replay during this period.
     Indeed, a management station must cope with the loss and re-
     ordering of messages resulting from anomalies in the network as a
     matter of course.
     However, a managed object, snmpSetSerialNo [15], is specifically
     defined for use with SNMPv2 set operations in order to provide a
     mechanism to ensure the processing of SNMPv2 messages occurs in a
     specific order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  The frequency with which the secrets of an SNMPv2 user should be
     changed is indirectly related to the frequency of their use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Protecting the secrets from disclosure is critical to the overall
     security of the protocols. Frequent use of a secret provides a
     continued source of data that may be useful to a cryptanalyst in
     exploiting known or perceived weaknesses in an algorithm.  Frequent
     changes to the secret avoid this vulnerability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Changing a secret after each use is generally regarded as the most
     secure practice, but a significant amount of overhead may be
     associated with that approach.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Note, too, in a local environment the threat of disclosure may be
     less significant, and as such the changing of secrets may be less
     frequent.  However, when public data networks are the communication
     paths, more caution is prudent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Defining Users</h3></a>

   The mechanisms defined in this document employ the notion of "users"
   having access rights.  How "users" are defined is subject to the
   security policy of the network administration. For example, users
   could be individuals (e.g., "joe" or "jane"), or a particular role
   (e.g., "operator" or "administrator"), or a combination (e.g., "joe-
   operator", "jane-operator" or "joe-admin").  Furthermore, a "user"
   may be a logical entity, such as a manager station application or set
   of manager station applications, acting on behalf of a individual or
   role, or set of individuals, or set of roles, including combinations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Appendix A describes an algorithm for mapping a user "password" to a
   16 octet value for use as either a user's authentication key or
   privacy key (or both).  Passwords are often generated, remembered,
   and input by a human.  Human-generated passwords may be less than the
   16 octets required by the authentication and privacy protocols, and
   brute force attacks can be quite easy on a relatively short ASCII
   character set.  Therefore, the algorithm is Appendix A performs a
   transformation on the password.  If the Appendix A algorithm is used,
   agent implementations (and agent configuration applications) must
   ensure that passwords are at least 8 characters in length.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Because the Appendix A algorithm uses such passwords (nearly)
   directly, it is very important that they not be easily guessed.  It
   is suggested that they be composed of mixed-case alphanumeric and
   punctuation characters that don't form words or phrases that might be
   found in a dictionary.  Longer passwords improve the security of the
   system.  Users may wish to input multiword phrases to make their
   password string longer while ensuring that it is memorable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that there is security risk in configuring the same "user" on
   multiple systems where the same password is used on each system,
   since the compromise of that user's secrets on one system results in
   the compromise of that user on all other systems having the same
   password.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The algorithm in Appendix A avoids this problem by including the
   agent's agentID value as well as the user's password in the
   calculation of a user's secrets; this results in the user's secrets
   being different at different agents; however, if the password is
   compromised the algorithm in Appendix A is not effective.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Conformance</h3></a>

   To be termed a "Secure SNMPv2 implementation", an SNMPv2
   implementation:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> - must implement the Digest Authentication Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> - must, to the maximal extent possible, prohibit access to the
   secret(s) of each user about which it maintains information in a LCD,
   under all circumstances except as required to generate and/or
   validate SNMPv2 messages with respect to that user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> - must implement the SNMPv2 USEC MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, an SNMPv2 agent must provide initial configuration in
   accordance with Appendix A.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementation of the Symmetric Encryption Protocol is optional.

APPENDIX A - Installation

A.1.   Agent Installation Parameters

During installation, an agent is configured with several parameters.
These include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(1)  a security posture<br>

     The choice of security posture determines the extent of the view
     configured for unauthenticated access.  One of three possible
     choices is selected:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          minimum-secure,
          semi-secure, or
          very-secure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(2)  one or more transport service addresses<br>

     These parameters may be specified explicitly, or they may be
     specified implicitly as the same set of network-layer addresses
     configured for other uses by the device together with the well-
     known transport-layer "port" information for the appropriate
     transport domain [13].  The agent listens on each of these
     transport service addresses for messages sent on behalf of any user
     it knows about.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">(3)  one or more secrets<br>

     These are the authentication/privacy secrets for the first user to
     be configured.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     One way to accomplish this is to have the installer enter a
     "password" for each required secret. The password is then
     algorithmically converted into the required secret by:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     - forming a string of length 1,048,576 octets by repeating the
       value of the password as often as necessary, truncating
       accordingly, and using the resulting string as the input to the
       MD5 algorithm. The resulting digest, termed "digest1", is used in
       the next step.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     - a second string of length 44 octets is formed by concatenating
       digest1, the agent's agentID value, and digest1. This string is
       used as input to the MD5 algorithm. The resulting digest is the
       required secret (see Appendix A.2).
   With these configured parameters, the agent instantiates the
   following user, context, views and access rights.  This configuration
   information should be readOnly (persistent).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  One user:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                         privacy not supported   privacy supported
                         ---------------------   -----------------

       <authPrivateKey>  authentication key      authentication key

       <privPrivateKey>  --                      privacy key

  -  One local context with its <contextSelector> as the empty-string.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  One view for authenticated access:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          - the <all> MIB view is the "internet" subtree.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  A second view for unauthenticated access.  This view is configured
     according to the selected security posture.  For the "very-secure"
     posture:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          - the <restricted> MIB view is the union of the "snmp" [15],
          "usecAgent" and "usecStats" subtrees.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     For the "semi-secure" posture:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          - the <restricted> MIB view is the union of the "snmp" [15],
          "usecAgent", "usecStats" and "system" subtrees.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     For the "minimum-secure" posture:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          - the <restricted> MIB view is the "internet" subtree.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  -  Access rights to allow:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        - read-only access for unauthenticated messages on behalf of the
          user "public" to the <restricted> MIB view of contextSelector
          "".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        - read-write access for authenticated but not private messages
          on behalf of the user "public" to the <all> MIB view of
          contextSelector "".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        - if privacy is supported, read-write access for authenticated
          and private messages on behalf of the user "public" to the
          <all> MIB view of contextSelector "".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A.2.   Password to Key Algorithm

   The following code fragment demonstrates the password to key
   algorithm which can be used when mapping a password to an
   authentication or privacy key. (The calls to MD5 are as documented in
   RFC 1321.)

void password_to_key(password, passwordlen, agentID, key)
    u_char *password;       /* IN */
    u_int   passwordlen;    /* IN */
    u_char *agentID;        /* IN - pointer to 12 octet long agentID */
    u_char *key;            /* OUT - caller supplies pointer to 16
                               octet buffer */ {
    MD5_CTX     MD;
    u_char      *cp, password_buf[64];

A.3.   Password to Key Sample

   The following shows a sample output of the password to key algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With a password of "maplesyrup" the output of the password to key
   algorithm before the key is localized with the agent's agentID is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    '9f af 32 83 88 4e 92 83 4e bc 98 47 d8 ed d9 63'H

   After the intermediate key (shown above) is localized with the
   agentID value of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    '00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02'H

   the final output of the password to key algorithm is:
