   This document specifies IP-SFS, a method for the encapsulation and
   transmission of IPv4/IPv6 packets over the Semaphore Flag Signaling
   System (SFSS).  The SFSS is an internationally recognized alphabetic
   communication system based upon the waving of a pair of hand-held
   flags [JCroft, Wikipedia].  Under the SFSS, each alphabetic character
   or control signal is indicated by a particular flag pattern, called a
   Semaphore Flag Signal (SFS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IP-SFS provides reliable transmission of IP datagrams over a half-
   duplex channel between two interfaces.  At the physical layer, SFSS
   uses optical transmission, normally through the atmosphere using
   solar illumination and line-of-sight photonics.  A control protocol
   (Section 4) allows each interface to contend for transmission on the
   common channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification defines only unicast transmission.  Broadcast is
   theoretically possible, but there are some physical restrictions on
   channel direction dispersion.  This is a topic for future study.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the place of the SFSS in the
   Internet protocol hierarchy.

   IP-SFS adapts the standard SFSS to encode an alphabet of 16 signals
   (flag patterns) to represent data values 0-15 (Section 3.2.1) and 9
   signals to represent control functions (Section 3.2.2).  With 16 data
   signals, IP-SFS transmission is based upon 4-bit nibbles, two per
   octet.  Each of the signal patterns defined in Section 3.2 is called
   an SFS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   IP-SFS Frame Description</h3></a>

   IP datagrams are formatted into IP-SFS frames by adding IP-SFS
   headers and trailers.  Figure 2 shows the format of one IP-SFS frame.
   The frame is delimited by a control SFS called FST (Frame Start) and
   a control SFS called FEN (Frame End).  It is composed of a series of
   4-bit nibbles, one per SFS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An IP datagram will be fragmented into multiple successive IP-SFS
   frames if necessary.  When an IP datagram is fragmented into N
   frames, the first frame will be sent with frame number N-1, the
   second with frame number N-2, ..., and the last with frame number 0.

   An interface is constructed through the participation of one or more

   (RX).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Establishing a Connection</h3></a>

   IP-SFS is strictly point-to-point.  Unless interface members are
   acquainted with each other, a brief introduction of both sides is
   suggested prior to setting up a link to reduce the likelihood of
   interface-spoofing attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interfaces must agree on two different IP addresses on the same

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interfaces are free to negotiate any period of time as TIMEOUT.
   Possible values for TIMEOUT are the time it takes to smoke a
   cigarette or the time it takes to drink a glass of water.  If
   negotiation fails, TIMEOUT defaults to 60 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The same procedure may be applied for the KeepALive FReQuency

   Interfaces in State Idle must be ready to send an IP datagram
   provided by a local higher-level protocol or to receive a datagram
   from the link-partner.  Interfaces in State Idle must send keep-alive
   signals KAL at a frequency of at least KAL_FRQ.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are no further definitions for State Idle, but we recommend
   staying away from alcoholic beverages or other types of drugs that
   could lead to an increased number of FUN and/or SUN signals, a
   decrease in bandwidth, or an increase of line latency.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the number of IP datagrams in the transmission queue is >0, the
   interface may try to initiate a session by sending an RTT to the link

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Session Initiation</h3></a>

   An interface receiving a datagram from an Internet layer protocol
   level may start signaling RTT.
   If the link partner does not respond with RTR within TIMEOUT, or the

   for a random period of time between 2 seconds and TIMEOUT, before
   resending the RTT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the link partner transmits RTR, the interface transmits the number
   of IP-SFS frames to be transmitted in this session as two SFSs
   followed by another RTT.  If the link partner does not transmit the

   followed by RTR, the interface switches to State Transmitting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unless obstructed through environmental noise or great distance,
   hollering can be used to request line discipline from the link
   partner in State Idle.  The use of cellphones is also an option,

   could result in interface damage or destruction.  This would be
   counterproductive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   State Transmitting</h3></a>

   Transmission of one IP-SFS frame starts with FST.  After FST and
   before FEN have been transmitted, the interface may acknowledge a
   received FUN and restart the transmission of the active frame or
   discard the signal and continue transmission of the active IP-SFS
   frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an error occurs by transmitting a wrong data SFS, the interface
   may invalidate the last data SFS by transmitting SUN followed by the

   invalidated by sending a SUN for each invalid SFS, effectively back-
   spacing the sequence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Control SFSs cannot be invalidated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an error occurs, the interface may also transmit FUN and restart
   transmission of the active IP-SFS frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Whether the interfaces choose SUN or FUN for error correction is up
   to the interface, but it is suggested to use SUN for a single invalid
   SFS, and FUN whenever the interface failed to transmit several SFSs
   in a row.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After FEN has been transmitted, the transmitting interface waits for
   the link partner to transmit ACK or NAK.
   If ACK has been received, the transmitting interface removes the
   active frame and starts transmitting the next IP-SFS frame.  If no
   frames are left, the interface switches to State Idle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If NAK has been received, the transmission failed, and the interface
   must start transmitting the active frame again.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the link partner does not transmit ACK or NAK within TIMEOUT, the
   transmission failed, and the interface must start retransmitting the
   active IP-SFS frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If transmission of the same IP-SFS frame fails 5 times, the interface
   leaves the IP datagram in the transmission queue and switches to
   State Idle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   State Receiving</h3></a>

   In State Receiving, the interface stores each SFS received from the
   link partner in the receiving queue in the order of appearance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After FST and before FEN have been received, the interface may
   transmit FUN at any time to request a retransmission of the entire
   IP-SFS frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the time between two received SFSs exceeds TIMEOUT, the receiving
   interface must discard all data from the active IP-SFS frame and may
   additionally transmit FUN.  If the link partner does not continue
   transmitting within a second TIMEOUT period, the interface must clear
   the receiving queue and switch to State Idle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the interface receives SUN from the link partner, it must discard
   the last received data SFS (if any).  If N SUNs are received in a
   row, then the last N data SFS must be discarded, unless there are no
   more data SFS in the frame.  If there are no more data SFS in the
   frame to be discarded, the SUN signal must be ignored by the
   interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the receiving interface receives FUN from the link partner, it is
   free to discard the frame received thus far.  We suggest honoring FUN
   since discarding the signal will decrease bandwidth.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After FEN has been received, the receiving interface evaluates the
   checksum.  If the checksum is good, the interface transmits ACK.  If
   the Frame Number of the active frame is 0, the interface passes the
   entire data from the receiving queue to the higher level protocol,
   clears the receiving queue, and switches to State Idle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the checksum is incorrect, the interface transmits NAK.
	<a name="section-4.7"><h3>4.7   Terminating a Connection</h3></a>

   If the interface is in State Idle and the link partner did not
   transmit any kind of SFS for at least five times 1/KAL_FRQ, the
   connection is terminated and the interfaces are free to disband.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.8"><h3>4.8   Further Remarks</h3></a>

   Interfaces are connected to computer hardware by means of a suitable
   input device (RX) and a suitable output device (TX).  Possible
   devices include keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  Other means of
   connection are subject to availability and budget.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although it is theoretically possible to combine the TX and RX parts
   of an interface in one human being, we suggest dividing the
   operations among at least two people per interface.  For longer
   transmissions (multimedia streaming, video conferencing, etc.),
   consider rotating and providing substitutes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bandwidth tends to vary.  Typically TX starts at about 2-4 bits/s and
   will decrease over time due to exhaustion and lack of concentration.
   When an interface in TX State signals at a rate higher than the RX
   interface is able to receive, signal loss occurs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered
   insecure.  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
   discouraged unless security is provided by higher level protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interfaces tend to keep data in their memory.  There is no way to
   determine the lifetime of data in memory.  As a side effect, data
   might show up in unwanted locations at undesired times.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We are currently not aware of a technique to reliably delete data
   from interfaces' memory without permanent interface destruction.
