         A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for CableLabs

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'cablelabs'
   for Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources
   published by Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs).
   CableLabs specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN
   identification model.  Management activities for these and other
   resource types are handled by the manager of the CableLabs' Assigned
   Names and Numbers registry.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is
   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
   advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs,
   specification activities are organized into projects such as
   DOCSIS(R), PacketCable(TM), and OpenCable(TM), and technical work is
   conducted within focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and
   cable operator members are invited to join the focus teams that
   create technical specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Occasionally, CableLabs specification efforts require identifiers in
   a managed namespace so that they are unique and persistent.  To
   ensure that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a
   specific Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier
   (NID) for use by CableLabs is being specified in this document, in
   full conformance with the NID registration process specified in
   [RFC3406].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   URN Specification for CableLabs</h2></a>

   Namespace ID:
        cablelabs

   Registration information:
        registration version number: 1
        registration date: 2011-04-18

   Declared registrant of the namespace:
        Registering organization
           Name: Cable Television Laboratories, Inc.
           Address: 858 Coal Creek Circle, Louisville, CO 80027, USA
        Designated contact
           Role: Manager, Standards
           Email: ietf_standards@cablelabs.com

   Declaration of syntactic structure:
        The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
        "cablelabs" NID will have the following structure:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        {CLclass}:{CLClassSpecificString}

        The "CLclass" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
        syntax requirements specified in [RFC2141] and defines a
        specific class of resource type.  Each class will have a
        specific labeling scheme that is covered by
        "CLClassSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming
        requirements of [RFC2141].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        CableLabs maintains the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers
        [CANN] specification that will contain the assignment of
        CableLabs' resource classes and the specific registration values
        assigned for each resource class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Relevant ancillary documentation:
        CableLabs publishes information regarding the registered
        resources in the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers
        specification ([CANN]).
   Identifier uniqueness considerations:
        CableLabs will manage resource classes using the "cablelabs" NID
        and will be the authority for managing resources and associated
        subsequent strings.  CableLabs is expected to guarantee the
        uniqueness of the strings themselves, or it may permit secondary
        responsibility for certain defined resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        CableLabs could allow the use of experimental type values for
        testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may
        create collisions as multiple users may use the same values for
        resources and specific strings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Identifier persistence considerations:
        CableLabs will update the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers
        specification ([CANN]) to document the registered resources that
        use the "cablelabs" NID.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Process of identifier assignment:
        CableLabs will provide procedures for registration of each type
        of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have
        three types of registration activities:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        1.   Registered values associated with CableLabs documents or
             services
        2.   Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
        3.   Name models for use in experimental purposes

   Process for identifier resolution:
        The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;
        this is not applicable for this URN registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Rules for lexical equivalence:
        No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
        [RFC2141] apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Conformance with URN syntax:
        No special considerations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Validation mechanism:
        None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
        implemented in support of CableLabs activities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Scope:
        Global
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Example</h2></a>

   The following example represents a hypothetical URN that could be
   assigned by CableLabs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   urn:cablelabs:packetcable-example:ue:rst-sample

   This example defines the URN to be used for User Equipment (UE)
   conforming to the sample Residential SIP Telephony (RST) application
   specified within CableLabs' PacketCable RST specification suite.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Namespace Considerations</h2></a>

   CableLabs develops specifications that may require the use of data
   models.  URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions
   of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
   different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs across
   different versions of CableLabs specifications if they so wish.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Community Considerations</h2></a>

   Participants involved in the development and usage of CableLabs
   specifications and cable industry deployments will benefit from the
   publication of this namespace by providing consistent and reliable
   names for the XML namespaces, schema locations, and similar
   identifiers of physical data models published within CableLabs
   specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CableLabs specifications are publicly available and are licensed
   to manufacturers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  CableLabs will
   maintain the allocation of resources for the "cablelabs" NID within
   the following specification: "CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers"
   [CANN], which will be publicly available for viewing.  CableLabs will
   also maintain the corresponding specifications where the registered
   resources are referenced or used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document adds a new entry ("cablelabs") in the urn-namespaces
   registry.  This is the defining document.  The entry can be found in
   the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry available from
   the IANA site (http://www.iana.org) and any associated mirrors.
	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Acknowledgements</h2></a>

   The authors wish to thank Alfred Hoenes, Ted Hardie, and Peter Saint-
   Andre for their useful comments and suggestions.  The authors also
   acknowledge that the text from [RFC4358] formed the basis for the
   initial version of this document.
