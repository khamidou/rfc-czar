      DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm IANA Registry Updates

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) require the use of cryptographic
   algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.
   The algorithms specified for use with DNSSEC are reflected in an
   IANA-maintained registry.  This document presents a set of changes
   for some entries of the registry.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC, defined by
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702])
   use digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication
   and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes
   for digital signature algorithms (consisting of an asymmetric
   cryptographic algorithm and a one-way hash function).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document updates a set of entries in the IANA registry titled
   "DNS Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers".  These updated entries are
   given in Section 2.2 below.  This list includes changes to selected
   entries originally set aside for future algorithm specification that
   did not occur.  These three entries are changed to "Reserved" to
   avoid potential conflicts with older implementations.  This document
   also brings the list of references for entries up to date.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are auxiliary sub-registries related to the DNS Security
   (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry that deal with various Diffie-
   Hellman parameters used with DNSSEC.  These registry tables are not
   altered by this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The DNS Security Algorithm Numbers Sub-Registry</h2></a>

   The DNS Security Algorithm Numbers sub-registry (part of the Domain
   Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry) contains a
   set of entries that contain errors.  There are additional differences
   to entries that are described in Section 2.1, and the complete list
   of changed registry entries is in Section 2.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Updates and Additions</h3></a>

   This document updates three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved".
   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above entries are changed to "Reserved" because they were
   placeholders for algorithms that were not fully specified for use
   with DNSSEC.  Older implementations may still have these algorithm
   codes assigned, so these codes are reserved to prevent potential
   incompatibilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   DNS Security Algorithm Numbers Sub-Registry Table</h3></a>

   The list of DNS Security Algorithm Numbers sub-registry entry changes
   is given below.  All other existing entries in the sub-registry table
   are unchanged by this document and are not shown.  The other two
   sub-registries in the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm
   Numbers registry (DNS KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Prime Lengths and DNS
   KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Well-Known Prime/Generator Pairs) are not
   changed in any way by this document.

   This document updates a set of DNS Security Algorithm Numbers
   sub-registry entries as given in Section 2.2.  The changes include
   moving three registry entries to "Reserved" and updating the
   reference list for entries.
