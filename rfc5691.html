	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   MPEG Surround (Spatial Audio Coding, SAC) [23003-1] is an
   International Standard that was finalized by MPEG in January 2007.
   It is capable of re-creating N channels based on M < N transmitted
   channels and additional control data.  In the preferred modes of
   operating the Spatial Audio Coding system, the M channels can either
   be a single mono channel or a stereo channel pair.  The control data
   represents a significantly lower data rate than the data rate
   required for transmitting all N channels, making the coding very
   efficient while at the same time ensuring compatibility with M
   channel devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MPEG Surround standard incorporates a number of tools that enable
   features that allow for broad application of the standard.  A key
   feature is the ability to scale the spatial image quality gradually
   from very low spatial overhead towards transparency.  Another key
   feature is that the decoder input can be made compatible to existing
   matrixed surround technologies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As an example, for 5.1 multi-channel audio, the MPEG Surround encoder
   creates a stereo (or mono) downmix signal and spatial information
   describing the full 5.1 material in a highly efficient, parameterised
   format.  The spatial information is transmitted alongside the
   downmix.
   By using MPEG Surround, existing services can easily be upgraded to
   provide surround sound in a backwards-compatible fashion.  While a
   stereo decoder in an existing legacy consumer device ignores the MPEG
   Surround data and plays back the stereo signal without any quality
   degradation, an MPEG-Surround-enabled decoder will deliver high
   quality, multi-channel audio.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MPEG Surround decoder can operate in modes that render the multi-
   channel signal to multi-channel or stereo output, or it can operate
   in a two-channel headphone mode to produce a virtual surround output
   signal.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Definitions and Abbreviations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Definitions</h3></a>

   This memo makes use of the definitions specified in [14496-1],
   [14496-3], [23003-1], and [RFC3640].  Frequently used terms are
   summed up for convenience:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Access Unit:  An MPEG Access Unit is the smallest data entity to
      which timing information is attributed.  In the case of audio, an
      Access Unit is the smallest individually accessible portion of
      coded audio data within an elementary stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AudioSpecificConfig():  Extends the class DecoderSpecificInfo(), as
      defined in [14496-1], when the objectType indication refers to a
      stream complying with [14496-3].  AudioSpecificConfig() is used as
      the configuration structure for MPEG-4 audio as specified in
      [14496-3].  It contains the field audioObjectType, which
      distinguishes between the different audio codecs defined in
      [14496-3], general audio information (e.g., the sampling frequency
      and number of channels), and further codec-dependent information
      structures.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SpatialSpecificConfig():  Configuration structure for MPEG Surround
      audio coding, as specified in [23003-1].  An AudioSpecificConfig()
      with an audioObjectType of value 30 contains a
      SpatialSpecificConfig() structure.
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Abbreviations</h3></a>

     AOT:    Audio Object Type
     AAC:    Advanced Audio Coding
     ASC:    AudioSpecificConfig() structure
     AU:     Access Unit
     HE AAC: High Efficiency AAC
     PLI:    Profile and Level Indication
     SSC:    SpatialSpecificConfig() structure

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Transport of MPEG Surround</h2></a>

   From a top-level perspective, MPEG Surround data can be subdivided
   into configuration data contained in the SpatialSpecificConfig()
   (SSC) and the SpatialFrame(), which contains the MPEG Surround
   payload.  The configuration data can be signaled in-band or out-of-
   band.  In the case of in-band signaling the SSC is conveyed in a
   SacDataFrame() jointly with a SpatialFrame().  In the case of out-of-
   band signaling, the SSC is transmitted to the decoder separately,
   e.g., by Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] means.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SpatialFrame()s may be transmitted either embedded into the downmix
   stream (Section 4.1) or as individual elementary streams besides the
   downmix audio stream (Section 4.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The buffer definition for AAC decoders limits the size of an AU, as
   specified in [14496-3].  For high-bitrate applications that exceed
   this limit, all MPEG Surround data MUST be put in a separate stream,
   as defined in Section 4.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Embedded Spatial Audio Data in AAC Payloads</h3></a>

   [14496-3] defines the extension_payload() as a mechanism for
   transport of extension data inside AAC payloads.  Typical extension
   data include Spectral Band Replication (SBR) data and MPEG Surround
   data, i.e., a SacDataFrame() in extension_payload()s of type
   EXT_SAC_DATA. extension_payload()s reside inside the downmix AAC
   elementary stream.  The resulting single elementary stream is
   transported as specified in [RFC3640].  As AAC decoders are required
   to skip unknown extension data, MPEG Surround data can be embedded in
   backwards-compatible fashion and be transported with the mechanism
   already described in [RFC3640].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SacDataFrame() includes a SpatialFrame() and an optional header
   that contains an SSC.  Any SSC in a SacDataFrame() MUST be identical
   to the SSC conveyed via SDP for that stream.
   No new mode is introduced for SpatialFrame()s being embedded into AAC
   payloads.  Either the mode AAC-lbr or the mode AAC-hbr SHOULD be
   used.  The additional Media Type parameters, as defined in
   Section 5.1, SHOULD be present when SpatialFrame()s are embedded into
   AAC payloads.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/48000/2
   a=fmtp:96 streamType=5; profile-level-id=44; mode=AAC-hbr; config=131

     Duration=2048; MPS-profile-level-id=55; MPS-config=F1B4CF920442029B
     501185B6DA00;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this example, the stream specifies the HE AAC Profile at Level 2
   [Profile and Level Indication (PLI) 44] and the config string
   contains the hexadecimal representation of the HE AAC ASC
   [audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC); extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR);
   samplingFrequencyIndex=0x6 (24kHz);
   extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2
   (2.0 channels)] of the downmix AAC elementary stream that is using
   explicit backwards-compatible signaling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Furthermore, the stream specifies the MPEG Surround Baseline Profile
   at Level 3 (PLI55) and the MPS-config string contains the hexadecimal
   representation of the MPEG Surround ASC [audioObjectType=30 (MPEG

   (5.1 channels); sacPayloadEmbedding=1; SSC=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525
   tree; ResCoding=1; ResBands=[0,13,13,13])].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the a=fmtp line of the example above has been wrapped to
   fit the page; it would comprise a single line in the SDP file.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   MPEG Surround Elementary Stream</h3></a>

   MPEG Surround SpatialFrame()s can be present in an individual
   elementary stream.  This stream complements the stream containing the
   downmix audio data, which may be coded by an arbitrary coding scheme.
   MPEG Surround elementary streams are packetized as specified in
   [RFC3640].  The mode signaled and used for an MPEG Surround
   elementary stream MUST be either MPS-hbr or MPS-lbr.  The MPS-hbr
   mode SHALL be used when the frame size may exceed 63 bytes, e.g.,
   when high-bitrate residual coding is in use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The dependency relationships between the MPEG Surround elementary
   stream and the downmix stream are signaled as specified in [RFC5583].
   The media clocks of the MPEG Surround elementary stream and the
   downmix stream SHALL operate in the same clock domain, i.e., the
   clocks are derived from a common clock and MUST NOT drift.  RTCP
   sender reports MUST indicate that the stream timestamps are not
   drifting, i.e., that a single sender report for each stream is
   sufficient to establish unambiguous timing.  The sampling rate of the
   MPEG Surround signal and the decoded downmix signal MUST be
   identical.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If HE AAC is used as the coding scheme for the downmix, the RTP
   clock-rate of the downmix MAY be the sampling rate of the AAC core,
   i.e., the clock-rate of the MPEG Surround elementary stream is an
   integer multiple of the clock-rate of the downmix stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that separate RTP streams have different random RTP timestamp
   offsets, and therefore RTCP MUST be used to synchronize the coded
   downmix audio data and the MPEG Surround elementary stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   a=group:DDP L1 L2

   m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/48000/2
   a=fmtp:96 streamType=5; profile-level-id=44; mode=AAC-hbr; config=2B1
     18800; sizeLength=13; indexLength=3; indexDeltaLength=3; constantDu
     ration=2048
   a=mid:L1

   m=audio 5002 RTP/AVP 97
   a=rtpmap:97 mpeg4-generic/48000/6
   a=fmtp:97 streamType=5; profile-level-id=55; mode=MPS-hbr; config=F1B
     0CF920460029B601189E79E70; sizeLength=13; indexLength=3;  indexDelt
     aLength=3; constantDuration=2048
   a=mid:L2
   a=depend:97 lay L1:96

   In this example, the first stream specifies the HE AAC Profile at
   Level 2 (PLI44) and the config string contains the hexadecimal
   representation of the HE AAC ASC [audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC);
   extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR); samplingFrequencyIndex=0x6 (24kHz);
   extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2
   (2.0 channels)].
   The second stream specifies Baseline MPEG Surround Profile at Level 3
   (PLI55) and the config string contains the hexadecimal representation
   of the ASC [AOT=30(MPEG Surround); 48 kHz; 5.1-ch;
   sacPayloadEmbedding=0; SSC=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=1;

   considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload format
   defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and source
   authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of the RTP
   payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a suitable
   cryptographic integrity-protection mechanism.  Such a cryptographic
   system may also allow the authentication of the source of the
   payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format
   should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and source
   authentication capable of at least determining if an RTP packet is
   from a member of the RTP session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The AAC audio codec includes an extension mechanism to transmit extra

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient; although, if
   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   [RFC3711] is recommended.  Other mechanisms that may be used are
   IPsec [RFC4301] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP
