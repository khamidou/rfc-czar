                    Proposed Standard Socket Numbers

I propose that there be a czar (me ?) who hands out official socket
numbers for use by standard protocols.  This czar should also keep track
of and publish a list of those socket numbers where host specific
services can be obtained.  I further suggest that the initial allocation
be as follows:
        Sockets         Assignment
        0-63            Network wide standard functions
        64-127          Host specific functions
        128-239         Reserved for future use
        240-255         Any experimental function

and within the network wide standard functions the following particular
assignment be made:
        Socket          Assignment
           1            Telnet
           3            File Transfer
           5            Remote Job Entry
           7            Echo
           9            Discard

these socket numbers (decimal) are to be used for the socket called "L"
in the official Initial Connection protocol (ICP) as specified in NIC
