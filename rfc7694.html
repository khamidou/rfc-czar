	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   In HTTP, content codings allow for payload encodings such as for
   compression or integrity checks ([RFC7231], Section 3.1.2).  In
   particular, the "gzip" content coding ([RFC7230], Section 4.2) is
   widely used for payload data sent in response messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Content codings can be used in request messages as well; however,
   discoverability is not on par with response messages.  This document
   extends the HTTP "Accept-Encoding" header field ([RFC7231],
   Section 5.3.4) for use in responses, to indicate the content codings
   that are supported in requests.  It furthermore updates the
   definition of status code 415 (Unsupported Media Type) ([RFC7231],
   Section 6.5.13), recommending that the "Accept-Encoding" header field
   be included when appropriate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Notational Conventions</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document reuses terminology defined in the base HTTP
   specifications, namely Section 2 of [RFC7230] and Section 3.1.2 of
   [RFC7231].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Using the 'Accept-Encoding' Header Field in Responses</h2></a>

   Section 5.3.4 of [RFC7231] defines "Accept-Encoding" as a request
   header field only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification expands that definition to allow "Accept-Encoding"
   as a response header field as well.  When present in a response, it
   indicates what content codings the resource was willing to accept in
   the associated request.  A field value that only contains "identity"
   implies that no content codings were supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that this information is specific to the associated request; the
   set of supported encodings might be different for other resources on
   the same server and could change over time or depend on other aspects
   of the request (such as the request method).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 6.5.13 of [RFC7231] defines status code 415 (Unsupported
   Media Type) to apply to problems related to both media types and
   content codings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers that fail a request due to an unsupported content coding
   ought to respond with a 415 status and ought to include an "Accept-
   Encoding" header field in that response, allowing clients to
   distinguish between issues related to content codings and media
   types.  In order to avoid confusion with issues related to media
   types, servers that fail a request with a 415 status for reasons
   unrelated to content codings MUST NOT include the "Accept-Encoding"
   header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is expected that the most common use of "Accept-Encoding" in
   responses will have the 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code, in
   response to optimistic use of a content coding by clients.  However,
   the header field can also be used to indicate to clients that content
   codings are supported, to optimize future interactions.  For example,
   a resource might include it in a 2xx response when the request
   payload was big enough to justify use of a compression coding but the
   client failed do so.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Example</h2></a>

   A client submits a POST request using the "compress" content coding
   ([RFC7231], Section 3.1.2.1):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     POST /edit/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry
     Content-Encoding: compress

     ...compressed payload...

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The server rejects the request because it only allows the "gzip"
   content coding:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
     Date: Fri, 09 May 2014 11:43:53 GMT
     Accept-Encoding: gzip
     Content-Length: 68
     Content-Type: text/plain

     This resource only supports the "gzip" content coding in requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At this point, the client can retry the request with the supported
   "gzip" content coding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Alternatively, a server that does not support any content codings in
   requests could answer with:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
     Date: Fri, 09 May 2014 11:43:53 GMT
     Accept-Encoding: identity
     Content-Length: 61
     Content-Type: text/plain

     This resource does not support content codings in requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Deployment Considerations</h2></a>

   Servers that do not support content codings in requests already are
   required to fail a request that uses a content coding.
   Section 6.5.13 of [RFC7231] defines the status code 415 (Unsupported
   Media Type) for this purpose, so the only change needed is to include
   the "Accept-Encoding" header field with the value "identity" in that
   response.
   Servers that do support some content codings are required to fail
   requests with unsupported content codings as well.  To be compliant
   with this specification, servers will need to use the status code 415
   (Unsupported Media Type) to signal the problem and will have to
   include an "Accept-Encoding" header field that enumerates the content
   codings that are supported.  As the set of supported content codings
   is usually static and small, adding the header field ought to be
   trivial.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This specification only adds discovery of supported content codings
   and diagnostics for requests failing due to unsupported content
   codings.  As such, it doesn't introduce any new security
   considerations over those already present in HTTP/1.1 (Section 9 of
   [RFC7231]) and HTTP/2 (Section 10 of [RFC7540]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, the point of better discoverability and diagnostics is to
   make it easier to use content codings in requests.  This might lead
   to increased usage of compression codings such as gzip (Section 4.2
   of [RFC7230]), which, when used over a secure channel, can enable
   side-channel attacks such as BREACH (see Section 10.6 of [RFC7540]
   and [BREACH]).  At the time of publication, it was unclear how
   BREACH-like attacks can be applied to compression in HTTP requests.
