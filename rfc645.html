               Network Standard Data Specification Syntax

INTRODUCTION

   This document defines the basic components of a Network Standard Data
   Specification (NSDS) syntax.  A NSDS is intended to provide a
   mechanism for specifying all the attributes of a collection of bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The definition of a complete NSDS syntax is expected to require an
      extended effort.  Therefore the initial scope of this document has
      been constrained to provide only a basic syntactic environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to demonstrate a specific use for the NSDS, this document
   also provides the complete syntax for specifying the PATHNAME
   attributes of a collection of bits, to the level of a file.  Addition
   of new subparamters should not be difficult.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In this context, "pathname" referes to that information which
      specifies the LOCATION of a collection of bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The pathname syntax is essentially the same as that proposed in
      RFC 615 (NIC -- 21531,).  Modifications were made in order to
      allow for graceful addition of other file attributes and to
      optimize use by humans and by processes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   I would like to thank Jon Postel, Jerry Popek, Vint Cerf, Jim White,
   Charlie Kline, Buz Owen, Ken Pogran, Jerry Burchfiel and Tom Boynton
   for their suggestions.
HUMAN AND MACHINE FACTORS

   Since computers tend to prefer more highly structured envireonments
   than do humans, aspects of the NSDS syntax are permitted to be
   different for computers than they are for humans.  Specifically:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For computers (highly-structured mode), keyword fields are fixed
      length and the variable-length data subfields are prefaced by a
      byte count.  Additionally in highly structured mode, the possible
      contents of data subfields may be more constrained than for the
      semi-structured mode.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For humans (semi-structured mode), keyword subfields are variable
      length and data subfields are surrounded by delimeter characters.
      A keyword must be long enough to distinguish it from other
      keywords.  That is, partial-name specification is permitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">STRUCTURE OF THE GENERAL SYNTACTIC ENVIRONMENT

Overview:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A NSDS is prefaced by one or two percent signs, followed by a set of
   fields subject to context-free interpretation, and terminated with a
   space.  Pathname fields precede any other file attribute
   specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The BNF:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <NSDS>        ::=  <flag> <path> <otherstuff> <sp>

   <flag>        ::=  % / %%

   <path>        ::=  pathname fields, as described below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <otherstuff>  ::=  fields for specifying data storage and accesss
                      characteristics, to be defined later.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <sp>          ::=  space.
Comments:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The <flag> indicates escape-tp-NSDS-syntax.  One percent sign
   indicates semi-structured syntax, two indicate that highly-structured
   syntax is being used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Only <flag> must be considered in relation to any host's current
      syntax.  It is not currently known to conflict with any host's
      syntax.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Exclamation mark (!) is the only other character that seems
         permissible (on the assumption that the character should be a
         graphic).  Its use would cause minor problems at Multics; but
         more importantly as a graphic, it is too similar to the numeral
         "1".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The basic (highest-level) syntax for individual <path> and
   <otherstuff> fields is the same, as defined below.  The remaining
   lower-level syntax (including permissible keywords and data subfield
   contents) for <otherstuff> fields is left for later.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">BASIC UNITS OF SUBSTRUCTURE

Overview:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A semi-structured field begins with a varying-length descriptor.  The
   descriptor is followed by a varying-length data subfield, which is
   surrounded by delimeter characters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Highly-structured fields have fixed-length descriptors, followed by a
   data byte-count, followed by the data

BNF for individual fields:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <field>       ::=  <machine> / <human>

   <machine>     ::=  <stru-field> / <stru-field> <machine>

   <stru-field>  ::=  <stru-key> <count> <data>

   <stru-key>    ::=  4-character field definition keyword; see
                      below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <count>       ::=  one-byte binary count of number of bytes of
                      <data>.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <human>       ::=  <h-field> / <h-field> <human>
   <h-field>     ::=  <h-key> <h-rest>

   <h-key>       ::=  Variable-length field definition keyword; see
                      below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <h-rest>      ::=  <l-delim> <data> <r-delim>
                      /  <l-delim> <data> <r-delim> <h-rest>

   <l-delim>     ::=  any non-alphabetic printable character that is
                      not in the succeeding <data> subfield and that
                      is acceptable to the object site.  For visual
                      aesthetics and to facilitate human parsing,
                      anything <l-delim> is a left-bracket character
                      (<, [, (, -), <r-delim> must be the
                      complementary right-bracket
                      character (>, ], ), |).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <r-delim>     ::=  either 1) the same character as <l-delim> or 2)
                      if the <l-delim> character is a left-bracket
                      character (<, [, (, -) then its complementary
                      right-bracket (>, ], ), |).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <data>        ::=  any sequence of characters acceptable to the
                      object site.  This is the actual data subfield
                      with the file, directory, device (or whatever)
                      attribute value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Elaboration:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Case is irrelevant to the syntax, though some sites will care about
   case in <data> subfields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   They key (<stru-key> or <h-key>) indicates what part of the NSDS the
   next <data> subfield refers to.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <R-delim> amd <l-delim> are used to delimit the beginning and end of
   the <data> subfield.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <Fields> for pathnames ARE order dependent, but defaulted ones may be
   omitted.  The order is as indicated for <key>s, below. That is,
   Network, Host, ... Siteparm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Keywords are used, even though pathname attributes are ordered, to
      facilitate the addition of new fields and to be consistent with
      the syntax for <otherstuff> fields which are expected to be
      unordered.
   <Field>s or <h-rest> subfields may be repeated, as permitted by the
   object site.  A series of <h-rest> subfields, without any <h-key>
   subfields is interpreted as a series of <h-field>s with identical
   <key>s.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Also, note that since the syntax does not constrain the contents
      of <data> subfields, compound names within a single <data>
      subfield are allowed.  The delimeter used to separate names within
      a <data> subfield must be different from <l-delim>/<r-delim> and
      the same as that used at the object site, since that is the only
      site which will be able to interpret the <data> subfield.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The validity of any combinations of <field>s is entirely site-
   dependent.  For example, if a site will accept it, an NSDS with a
   Host field, and nothing more, may be permissible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The validity of <data> subfields' contents is generally site-
      dependent.  Some exceptions are noted below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">PATHNAME ATTRIBUTES AND VALUES

   The basic syntax does not need to be altered, to create the ability
   to specify pathnames.  Only <key> values need to be defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Definitions of Pathname <key>s:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      They keyword for semi-structured mode is given first, followed by
      the keyword for highly-structured mode, if different.  For
      highly-structured mode, keywords that are less than four
      characters should be padded with blanks at the right.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Semi        Highly  Meaning

      NETWORK     NET     Reference to the network (e.g., ARPA)
                          connected to the HOST that contains or will
                          contain the collection of bits.

                          must serve to identify what Siteparm is
                          involved.  Each site will be responsible for
                          defining the syntax of Siteparm <data>
                          subfields it will accept.  Note that the
                          SITEPARM field allows specification of other

DEFAULTS FOR PATHNAME <DATA> SUBFIELDS:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Often, the appropriate default will be the last-used value.  However,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Network:       ARPA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Host:          The host interpreting the NSDS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Peripheral:    ONLINE (DISK).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Volume id:     Catalogued system space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Directory:     The user's current "working" directory, usually set

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Type:          None.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Siteparm:      None.
NUMBERS

   The following scheme is recommended for specifying numbers in <h-
   field> data subfields:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A sequence of numberic characters, optionally followed by a
      character indicating the radix.  The default radix is ten. "H"
      indicates hexadecimal; "O" (oh) indicates octal; "B" indicates
      binary; and (gratuitously) "D" indicates decimal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In <stru-field> data subfields, the number should be pure binary.
   Therefore, reference to a host on the Arpanet would require one 8-bit
   byte.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">GENERAL COMMENTS

   The syntax is intended to be adequate for all hosts, so any given
   portion of it may be inappropriate for any given host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A site is expected to permit specifications in a given field if
      that site already has a way of accepting the same information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Having two modes of specification (highly- and semi-structured)
      may prove to be unnecessary.  They are defined here merely as a
      convenience for experimentation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   I believe that modifications to the syntax will be graceful
   additions, rather than wholesale redesign, and thus can be deferred
   for a while.  Currently, any undefined attributes must be specified
   in a Siteparm field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first version of the syntax was a mix of Tenex and Multics
   conventions.  That is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (Network)[Host]Peripheral:Directory>Filename.Type;Sireparm

   Through visually more attractive and generally quicker to type, it
   lacks extensibility.  For example, adding a version number as a
   standard field would be difficult.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is asserted (conceded) that, as long as extensibility is kept as a
   design goal, no standardized [semi-structured] syntax will be as
   pleasant to use as currently exists on some systems.
SOME SAMPLE PATHNAMES

   Pathnames in NSDS that occupy more than one line, below, do so only
   because they are too long for a single line.  Bracketed numbers
   (e.g., <8>) indicate a single byte with the number as its decimal
   value. Blanks (spaces) are indicated by <sp>.
