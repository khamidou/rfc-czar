                              to establish contact with some service.
                              The UA retrieves service information from
                              the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

   Figure 1: FCIP Entity and SLPv2 Agent Relationship.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As indicated in Figure 1, each FCIP Entity contains an FCIP Control
   and Services Module that interfaces to an SLPv2 SA and UA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SA constructs a service advertisement of the type
   "service:fcip:entity" for each of the service URLs it wishes to
   register.  The service advertisement contains a lifetime, along with
   other attributes defined in the service template.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The remainder of the discovery process is identical to that used by
   any client/server pair implementing SLPv2:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. If an SLPv2 DA is found [RFC2608], the SA contacts the DA and
      registers the service advertisement.  Whether or not one or more
      SLPv2 DAs are discovered, the SA maintains the service
      advertisement itself and answers multicast UA queries directly.
   2. When the FCIP Entity requires contact information for a peer FCIP
      Entity, the UA either contacts the DA using unicast or the SA
      using multicast using an SLPv2 service request.  The UA service
      request includes a query, based on the attributes, to indicate the
      characteristics of the peer FCIP Entities it requires.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. Once the UA has the IP address and port number of a peer FCIP
      Entity, it may begin the normal connection procedure, as described
      in [RFC3821], to a peer FCIP Entity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of a DA is RECOMMENDED for SLPv2 operations in an FCIP
   environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.1"><h4>4.1.1   FCIP Discovery Domains</h4></a>

   The concept of a discovery domain provides further granularity of
   control of allowed discovery between FCIP Entities within a specific

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The SLPv2 security model as specified in [RFC2608] does not provide
   confidentiality, but does provide an authentication mechanism for UAs
   to assure that service advertisements only come from trusted SAs with
   the exception that it does not provide a mechanism for authenticating
   "zero-result responses".  See [RFC3723] for a discussion of the SLPv2
   [RFC2608] security model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once an FCIP Entity is discovered, authentication and authorization
   are handled by the FCIP protocol.  It is the responsibility of the
   providers of these services to ensure that an inappropriately
   advertised or discovered service does not compromise their security.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When no security is used for SLPv2, there is a risk of distribution
   of false discovery information.  The primary countermeasure for this
   risk is authentication.  When this risk is a significant concern,
   IPsec SAs SHOULD be used for FCIP traffic subject to this risk to
   ensure that FCIP traffic only flows between endpoints that have
   participated in IKE authentication.  For example, if an attacker
   distributes discovery information falsely claiming that it is an FCIP
   endpoint, it will lack the secret information necessary to
   successfully complete IKE authentication, and hence will be prevented
   from falsely sending or receiving FCIP traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There remains a risk of a denial of service attack based on repeated
   use of false discovery information that will cause the initiation of
   IKE negotiation.  The countermeasures for this are administrative
   configuration of each FCIP Entity to limit the peers that it is
   willing to communicate with (i.e., by IP address range and/or DNS
   domain), and maintenance of a negative authentication cache to avoid
   repeatedly contacting an FCIP Entity that fails to authenticate.
   These three measures (i.e., IP address range limits, DNS domain
   limits, negative authentication cache) MUST be implemented.
	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Security Implementation</h3></a>

   Security for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment is specified in
   [RFC3723].  IPsec is mandatory-to-implement for IPS clients and
   servers.  Thus, all IP storage clients, including those invoking SLP,
   can be assumed to support IPsec.  SLP servers, however, cannot be
   assumed to implement IPsec, since there is no such requirement in
   standard SLP.  In particular, SLP Directory Agents (DA) may be
   running on machines other than those running the IPS protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IPsec SHOULD be implemented for SLPv2 as specified in [RFC3723]; this
   includes ESP with a non-null transform to provide both authentication
   and confidentiality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Because the IP storage services have their own authentication
   capabilities when located, SLPv2 authentication is OPTIONAL to
   implement and use (as discussed in more detail in [RFC3723]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>
