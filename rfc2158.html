   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document contains the body parts defined in RFC 1495 for
   carrying image formats that were originally defined in MIME through
   an X.400 system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It also documents the OIDs assigned to these data formats as FTAM
   body parts, which allow the MIME types to be converted to FTAM body
   parts; this will probably be more useful than the new body parts
   defined here.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Newly defined X.400 body parts</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   The JPEG body part</h3></a>

   The following Extended Body Part is defined for JPEG data streams.
   It has no parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       jpeg-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
         DATA            OCTET STRING
         ::= mime-jpeg-body

       mime-jpeg-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
               { mixer-bp-data 3 }

   The content is as defined in [MIME].
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   The GIF body part</h3></a>

   The following Extended Body Part is defined for GIF data streams.  It
   has no parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       gif-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
         DATA            OCTET STRING
         ::= mime-gif-body

       mime-gif-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
               { mixer-bp-data 4 }

   The content is as defined in [MIME].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Defined equivalences with MIME types</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   image/jpeg - jpeg-body-part</h3></a>

   X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID jpeg-body-part
   MIME Content-Type: image/jpeg
   Conversion: None

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   image/jpeg - FTAM EMA JPEG</h3></a>

   X.400 Body Part: FTAM EMA JPEG
   MIME Content-Type: image/jpeg
   Conversion: None

   The OID assigned to JPEG by EMA in [MAWG] is

   { ema objects(2) messaging (2) attachments(1) jpeg-image(6) }<br>

   while EMA's OID is

   { joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1)<br>
   ema(113694) }<br>

   making the total OID, numeric only

   { 2 16 840 1 113694 2 2 1 6 }

	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   image/gif - gif-body-part</h3></a>

   X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID gif-body-part
   MIME Content-Type: image/gif
   Conversion: None
	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   image/gif - FTAM EMA GIF</h3></a>

   X.400 Body Part: FTAM EMA GIF
   MIME Content-Type: image/jpeg
   Conversion: None

   The OID assigned to JPEG by EMA in [MAWG] is

   { ema objects(2) messaging (2) attachments(1) gif-image(4) }<br>
