	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes a standard definition of MIME types
   associated with MP4 files and the guidelines for using them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MPEG-4 (ISO/IEC 14496) is a standard designed for the representation
   and delivery of multimedia information over a variety of transport
   protocols [1].  It includes interactive scene management and visual
   and audio representations, as well as system functionality like
   multiplexing, synchronization, and an object descriptor framework
   [2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The historical approach for MPEG data has been to declare it under
   "video", and this approach is followed for ISO/IEC 14496.  In
   addition, some MIME types are defined under "audio" and "application"
   for the streams not containing visual presentation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known as version 2)
   introduced a standard file type, called MP4 files, for encapsulating
   ISO/IEC 14496 data.  This is now separately specified as the MP4 file
   format [4], which in turn is based on the ISO base media file format
   [3].  A separate specification [5] covers the storage of Advanced
   Video Coding (AVC) (also known as H.264) [6] material in files based
   on the ISO base media file format.  The MP4 file type can be used in
   a number of ways; perhaps the most important of these is its use as
   an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 data, as a content-download
   format, and as the format read by streaming media servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a
   standard MIME type for serving these files (e.g., over HTTP).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ISO/IEC 14496 standard is broad, and therefore the type of data
   that may be in such a file can vary.  In brief, simple compressed
   video and audio (using a number of different compression algorithms)
   can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data about the
   presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside the
   file and so on.  Different top-level MIME types are used to identify
   the type of the contents in the file.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Selection of MIME Types for MP4 Files</h2></a>

   The MIME types to be assigned to MP4 files are selected according to
   the contents.  Basic guidelines for selecting MIME types are as
   follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   a) if the file contains neither visual nor audio presentations, but
      only, for example, MPEG-J or MPEG-7, use application/mp4;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   b) for all other files, including those that have MPEG-J, etc., in
      addition to video or audio streams, video/mp4 should be used;
      however:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   c) for files with audio but no visual aspect, including those that
      have MPEG-J, etc., in addition to audio streams, audio/mp4 may be
      used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In any case, these indicate files conforming to the "MP4"
   specification, ISO/IEC 14496-1:2000, systems file format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This section describes the MIME types and names to be used with
   various MPEG-4 contents.  Sections from 4.1 to 4.5 register five new
   MIME types with the IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interoperability considerations: A number of interoperating

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   It is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, Video,
   and Systems) in the MP4 file to overload the receiver/decoder's
   buffers.  This might compromise the functionality of the receiver or
   even crash it.  This is especially true for end-to-end systems like
   MPEG, where the buffer models are precisely defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An MP4 file supports the storage of stream types, including commands
   that are executed on the terminal such as OD command and BIFS
   commands, and programmatic content such as MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte
   Code) and ECMASCRIPT.  It is possible to use one or more of the above
   in a manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash the receiver or
   temporarily make it unavailable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and
   the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant
   MP4 files.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A security model is defined in ISO/IEC 14496 Systems MP4 files
   containing MPEG-J contents that comprises Java(TM) classes and
   objects.  MPEG-J defines a set of Java(TM) APIs and a secure
   execution model.  MPEG-J content can call this set of APIs and
   Java(TM) methods from a set of Java packages supported in the
   receiver within the defined security model.  According to this
   security model, downloaded byte code is forbidden to load libraries,
   to define native methods, to start programs, to read or write files,
   or to read system properties.
