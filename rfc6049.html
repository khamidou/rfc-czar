                     Spatial Composition of Metrics

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo utilizes IP performance metrics that are applicable to both
   complete paths and sub-paths, and it defines relationships to compose
   a complete path metric from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy
   with regard to the actual metrics.  This is called "spatial
   composition" in RFC 2330.  The memo refers to the framework for
   metric composition, and provides background and motivation for
   combining metrics to derive others.  The descriptions of several
   composed metrics and statistics follow.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework [RFC2330] describes two
   forms of metric composition: spatial and temporal.  The composition
   framework [RFC5835] expands and further qualifies these original
   forms into three categories.  This memo describes spatial
   composition, one of the categories of metrics under the umbrella of
   the composition framework.
   Spatial composition encompasses the definition of performance metrics
   that are applicable to a complete path, based on metrics collected on
   various sub-paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The main purpose of this memo is to define the deterministic
   functions that yield the complete path metrics using metrics of the
   sub-paths.  The effectiveness of such metrics is dependent on their
   usefulness in analysis and applicability with practical measurement
   methods.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The relationships may involve conjecture, and [RFC2330] lists four
   points that the metric definitions should include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the specific conjecture applied to the metric and assumptions of
      the statistical model of the process being measured (if any; see
      [RFC2330], Section 12),

   o  a justification of the practical utility of the composition in
      terms of making accurate measurements of the metric on the path,

   o  a justification of the usefulness of the composition in terms of
      making analysis of the path using A-frame concepts more effective,
      and

   o  an analysis of how the conjecture could be incorrect.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also, [RFC2330] gives an example using the conjecture that the delay
   of a path is very nearly the sum of the delays of the exchanges and
   clouds of the corresponding path digest.  This example is
   particularly relevant to those who wish to assess the performance of
   an inter-domain path without direct measurement, and the performance
   estimate of the complete path is related to the measured results for
   various sub-paths instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Approximate functions between the sub-path and complete path metrics
   are useful, with knowledge of the circumstances where the
   relationships are/are not applicable.  For example, we would not
   expect that delay singletons from each sub-path would sum to produce
   an accurate estimate of a delay singleton for the complete path
   (unless all the delays were essentially constant -- very unlikely).
   However, other delay statistics (based on a reasonable sample size)
   may have a sufficiently large set of circumstances where they are
   applicable.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Motivation</h3></a>

   One-way metrics defined in other RFCs (such as [RFC2679] and
   [RFC2680]) all assume that the measurement can be practically carried
   out between the source and the destination of interest.  Sometimes
   there are reasons that the measurement cannot be executed from the
   source to the destination.  For instance, the measurement path may
   cross several independent domains that have conflicting policies,
   measurement tools and methods, and measurement time assignment.  The
   solution then may be the composition of several sub-path
   measurements.  This means each domain performs the one-way
   measurement on a sub-path between two nodes that are involved in the
   complete path, following its own policy, using its own measurement
   tools and methods, and using its own measurement timing.  Under the
   appropriate conditions, one can combine the sub-path one-way metric
   results to estimate the complete path one-way measurement metric with
   some degree of accuracy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Requirements Language</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this memo, the characters "<=" should be read as "less than or
   equal to" and ">=" as "greater than or equal to".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Scope and Application</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Scope of Work</h3></a>

   For the primary IP Performance Metrics RFCs for loss [RFC2680], delay
   [RFC2679], and delay variation [RFC3393], this memo gives a set of
   metrics that can be composed from the same or similar sub-path
   metrics.  This means that the composition function may utilize:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the same metric for each sub-path;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  multiple metrics for each sub-path (possibly one that is the same
      as the complete path metric);

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  a single sub-path metric that is different from the complete path
      metric;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  different measurement techniques like active [RFC2330], [RFC3432]
      and passive [RFC5474].
   We note a possibility: using a complete path metric and all but one
   sub-path metric to infer the performance of the missing sub-path,
   especially when the "last" sub-path metric is missing.  However, such
   de-composition calculations, and the corresponding set of issues they
   raise, are beyond the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Application</h3></a>

   The composition framework [RFC5835] requires the specification of the
   applicable circumstances for each metric.  In particular, each
   section addresses whether the metric:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Requires the same test packets to traverse all sub-paths or may
      use similar packets sent and collected separately in each
      sub-path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Requires homogeneity of measurement methodologies or can allow a
      degree of flexibility (e.g., active, active spatial division
      [RFC5644], or passive methods produce the "same" metric).  Also,
      the applicable sending streams will be specified, such as Poisson,
      Periodic, or both.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Needs information or access that will only be available within an
      operator's domain, or is applicable to inter-domain composition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Requires synchronized measurement start and stop times in all
      sub-paths or largely overlapping measurement intervals, or no
      timing requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Requires the assumption of sub-path independence with regard to
      the metric being defined/composed or other assumptions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Has known sources of inaccuracy/error and identifies the sources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Incomplete Information</h3></a>

   In practice, when measurements cannot be initiated on a sub-path (and
   perhaps the measurement system gives up during the test interval),
   then there will not be a value for the sub-path reported, and the
   entire test result SHOULD be recorded as "undefined".  This case
   should be distinguished from the case where the measurement system
   continued to send packets throughout the test interval, but all were
   declared lost.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a composed metric requires measurements from sub-paths A, B, and
   C, and one or more of the sub-path results are undefined, then the
   composed metric SHOULD also be recorded as undefined.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Common Specifications for Composed Metrics</h2></a>

   To reduce the redundant information presented in the detailed metrics
   sections that follow, this section presents the specifications that
   are common to two or more metrics.  The section is organized using
   the same subsections as the individual metrics, to simplify
   comparisons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also, the index variables are represented as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  m = index for packets sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  n = index for packets received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  s = index for involved sub-paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Name: Type-P</h3></a>

   All metrics use the "Type-P" convention as described in [RFC2330].
   The rest of the name is unique to each metric.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.1"><h4>3.1.1   Metric Parameters</h4></a>

   o  Src, the IP address of a host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Dst, the IP address of a host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  T, a time (start of test interval).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Tf, a time (end of test interval).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds (for Poisson Streams).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  incT, the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit (for Periodic Streams).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  dT, the duration of the allowed interval for Periodic Stream
      sample start times.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  T0, a time that MUST be selected at random from the interval
      [T, T + dT] to start generating packets and taking measurements
      (for Periodic Streams).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  TstampSrc, the wire time of the packet as measured at MP(Src)
      (measurement point at the source).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  TstampDst, the wire time of the packet as measured at MP(Dst),
      assigned to packets that arrive within a "reasonable" time.
   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for packets at the destination, set
      sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long delays from
      packets that are discarded (lost); thus, the distribution of delay
      is not truncated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  M, the total number of packets sent between T0 and Tf.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  N, the total number of packets received at Dst (sent between T0
      and Tf).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  S, the number of sub-paths involved in the complete Src-Dst path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Type-P, as defined in [RFC2330], which includes any field that may
      affect a packet's treatment as it traverses the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In metric names, the term "<Sample>" is intended to be replaced by
   the name of the method used to define a sample of values of parameter
   TstampSrc.  This can be done in several ways, including:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Poisson: a pseudo-random Poisson process of rate lambda, whose
       values fall between T and Tf.  The time interval between
       successive values of TstampSrc will then average 1/lambda, as per
       [RFC2330].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  Periodic: a Periodic stream process with pseudo-random start time
       T0 between T and dT, and nominal inter-packet interval incT, as
       per [RFC3432].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.2"><h4>3.1.2   Definition and Metric Units</h4></a>

   This section is unique for every metric.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.3"><h4>3.1.3   Discussion and Other Details</h4></a>

   This section is unique for each metric.  The term "ground truth" is
   frequently used in these sections and is defined in Section 4.7 of
   [RFC5835].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.7"><h4>3.1.7   Justification of the Composition Function</h4></a>

   It is sometimes impractical to conduct active measurements between
   every Src-Dst pair.  Since the full mesh of N measurement points
   grows as N x N, the scope of measurement may be limited by testing
   resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There may be varying limitations on active testing in different parts
   of the network.  For example, it may not be possible to collect the
   desired sample size in each test interval when access link speed is
   limited, because of the potential for measurement traffic to degrade
   the user traffic performance.  The conditions on a low-speed access
   link may be understood well enough to permit use of a small sample
   size/rate, while a larger sample size/rate may be used on other
   sub-paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also, since measurement operations have a real monetary cost, there
   is value in re-using measurements where they are applicable, rather
   than launching new measurements for every possible source-destination
   pair.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.8"><h4>3.1.8   Sources of Deviation from the Ground Truth</h4></a>

   The measurement packets, each having source and destination addresses
   intended for collection at edges of the sub-path, may take a
   different specific path through the network equipment and links when
   compared to packets with the source and destination addresses of the

   Multi-Path and parallel (or bundled) links.  Therefore, the
   performance estimated from the composition of sub-path measurements
   may differ from the performance experienced by packets on the
   complete path.  Multiple measurements employing sufficient sub-path
   address pairs might produce bounds on the extent of this error.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We also note the possibility of re-routing during a measurement
   interval, as it may affect the correspondence between packets

   Related to the case of an alternate path described above is the case
   where elements in the measured path are unique to measurement system
   connectivity.  For example, a measurement system may use a dedicated
   link to a LAN switch, and packets on the complete path do not
   traverse that link.  The performance of such a dedicated link would
   be measured continuously, and its contribution to the sub-path
   metrics SHOULD be minimized as a source of error.

   Measurements of sub-path performance may not cover all the network
   elements on the complete path.  For example, the network exchange
   points might be excluded unless a cooperative measurement is
   conducted.  In this example, test packets on the previous sub-path
   are received just before the exchange point, and test packets on the
   next sub-path are injected just after the same exchange point.
   Clearly, the set of sub-path measurements SHOULD cover all critical
   network elements in the complete path.

   At a specific point in time, no viable route exists between the
   complete path source and destination.  The routes selected for one or
   more sub-paths therefore differ from the complete path.
   Consequently, spatial composition may produce finite estimation of a
   ground truth metric (see Section 4.7 of [RFC5835]) between a source
   and a destination, even when the route between them is undefined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For delay-related metrics, one-way delay always depends on packet
   size and link capacity, since it is measured in [RFC2679] from first

   We define the quantile of the PDV sample as the value where the
   specified fraction of singletons is less than the given value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.5"><h4>6.1.5   Composition Functions</h4></a>

   This section gives two alternative composition functions.  The
   objective is to estimate a quantile of the complete path delay
   variation distribution.  The composed quantile will be estimated
   using information from the sub-path delay variation distributions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-6.1.5.1"><h4>6.1.5.1   Approximate Convolution</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6049.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   The Type-P-Finite-One-way-Delay-<Sample>-Stream samples from each
   sub-path are summarized as a histogram with 1-ms bins representing
   the one-way delay distribution.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   From [STATS], the distribution of the sum of independent random
   variables can be derived using the relation:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Type-P-Composite-One-way-pdv-refmin-quantile-a =

                       .  .
                      /  /
  P(X + Y + Z <= a) = |  | P(X <= a - y - z) * P(Y = y) * P(Z = z) dy dz
                      /  /
                     `  `
                     z  y
   Note that dy and dz indicate partial integration above, and that y
   and z are the integration variables.  Also, the probability of an
   outcome is indicated by the symbol P(outcome), where X, Y, and Z are
   random variables representing the delay variation distributions of
   the sub-paths of the complete path (in this case, there are three
   sub-paths), and "a" is the quantile of interest.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This relation can be used to compose a quantile of interest for the
   complete path from the sub-path delay distributions.  The histograms
   with 1-ms bins are discrete approximations of the delay
   distributions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-6.1.5.2"><h4>6.1.5.2   Normal Power Approximation (NPA)</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6049.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   Type-P-One-way-Composite-pdv-refmin-NPA for the complete source to
   destination path can be calculated by combining the statistics of all
   the constituent sub-paths in the process described in [Y.1541],
   Clause 8 and Appendix X.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.6"><h4>6.1.6   Statement of Conjecture and Assumptions</h4></a>

   The delay distribution of a sufficiently large stream of packets
   measured on each sub-path during the interval [T, Tf] will be
   sufficiently stationary, and the sub-path distributions themselves
   are sufficiently independent, so that summary information describing
   the sub-path distributions can be combined to estimate the delay
   distribution of the complete path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is assumed that the one-way delay distributions of the sub-paths
   and the complete path are continuous.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.7"><h4>6.1.7   Justification of the Composition Function</h4></a>

   See the common section (Section 3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.8"><h4>6.1.8   Sources of Deviation from the Ground Truth</h4></a>

   In addition to the common deviations, a few additional sources exist
   here.  For one, very tight distributions with ranges on the order of
   a few milliseconds are not accurately represented by a histogram with
   1-ms bins.  This size was chosen assuming an implicit requirement on
   accuracy: errors of a few milliseconds are acceptable when assessing
   a composed distribution quantile.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also, summary statistics cannot describe the subtleties of an
   empirical distribution exactly, especially when the distribution is
   very different from a classical form.  Any procedure that uses these
   statistics alone may incur error.
	<a name="section-6.1.9"><h4>6.1.9   Specific Cases where the Conjecture Might Fail</h4></a>

   If the delay distributions of the sub-paths are somehow correlated,
   then neither of these composition functions will be reliable
   estimators of the complete path distribution.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In practice, sub-path delay distributions with extreme outliers have
   increased the error of the composed metric estimate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.10"><h4>6.1.10   Application of Measurement Methodology</h4></a>

   See the common section (Section 3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   Denial-of-Service Attacks</h3></a>

   This metric requires a stream of packets sent from one host (source)
   to another host (destination) through intervening networks.  This
   method could be abused for denial-of-service attacks directed at the
   destination and/or the intervening network(s).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Administrators of source, destination, and intervening networks
   should establish bilateral or multilateral agreements regarding the
   timing, size, and frequency of collection of sample metrics.  Use of
   this method in excess of the terms agreed upon between the
   participants may be cause for immediate rejection or discarding of
   packets, or other escalation procedures defined between the affected
   parties.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   User Data Confidentiality</h3></a>

   Active use of this method generates packets for a sample, rather than
   taking samples based on user data, and does not threaten user data
   confidentiality.  Passive measurement MUST restrict attention to the
   headers of interest.  Since user payloads may be temporarily stored
   for length analysis, suitable precautions MUST be taken to keep this
   information safe and confidential.  In most cases, a hashing function
   will produce a value suitable for payload comparisons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3   Interference with the Metrics</h3></a>

   It may be possible to identify that a certain packet or stream of
   packets is part of a sample.  With that knowledge at the destination
   and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change the
   processing of the packets (e.g., increasing or decreasing delay),
   which may distort the measured performance.  It may also be possible
   to generate additional packets that appear to be part of the sample
   metric.  These additional packets are likely to perturb the results
   of the sample measurement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To discourage the kind of interference mentioned above, packet
   interference checks, such as cryptographic hash, may be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   Metrics Registry as described in the initial version of the registry
