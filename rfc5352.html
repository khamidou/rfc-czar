</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP; RFC 5352), in conjunction
   with the Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP; RFC 5353),
   provides a high-availability data transfer mechanism over IP
   networks.  ASAP uses a handle-based addressing model that isolates a
   logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus
   effectively eliminating the binding between the communication
   endpoint and its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes
   a single point of failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a
   pool, providing full transparent support for server pooling and load
   sharing.  It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a
   server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting
   the service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level
   redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol
   (SCTP; RFC 4960).  Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST
   have an accompanying transport mapping document.  It should be noted
   that ASAP messages passed between Pool Elements (PEs) and ENRP
   servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The high-availability server pooling is gained by combining two
   protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user
   interface for Pool Handle to address translation, load sharing
   management, and fault management, while ENRP defines the high-
   availability Pool Handle translation service.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP), when used in conjunction
   with Endpoint Name Resolution Protocol [RFC5353], provides a high-
   availability data-transfer mechanism over IP networks.  ASAP uses a
   handle-based addressing model that isolates a logical communication
   endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the
   binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP
   address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When multiple receiver instances exist under the same handle (aka a
   server pool), an ASAP Endpoint will select one Pool Element (PE),
   based on the current load sharing policy indicated by the server
   pool, and deliver its message to the selected PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While delivering the message, ASAP can be used to monitor the
   reachability of the selected PE.  If it is found unreachable, before
   notifying the message sender (an ASAP User) of the failure, ASAP can
   automatically select another PE (if one exists) under that pool and
   attempt to deliver the message to that PE.  In other words, ASAP is
   capable of transparent failover amongst PE instances within a server
   pool.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ASAP depends on ENRP, which provides a high-availability Pool
   Handlespace.  ASAP is responsible for the abstraction of the
   underlying transport technologies, load distribution management,
   fault management, as well as presentation to the upper layer (aka an
   ASAP User) via a unified primitive interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When SCTP [RFC4960] is used as the transport layer protocol, ASAP can
   seamlessly incorporate the link-layer redundancy provided by SCTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines the ASAP portion of the high-availability
   server pool.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Definitions</h3></a>

   This document uses the following terms:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ASAP User:  Either a PE or Pool User (PU) that uses ASAP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Business Card:  When presented by a PU or PE, it specifies the pool
      the sender belongs to and provides a list of alternate PEs in case
      of failovers.
   Operational Scope:  The part of the network visible to pool users by
      a specific instance of the reliable server pooling protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pool (or Server Pool):  A collection of servers providing the same
      application functionality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pool Handle:  A logical pointer to a pool.  Each server pool will be
      identifiable in the operational scope of the system by a unique
      Pool Handle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pool Element:  A server entity having registered to a pool.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pool User:  A server pool user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pool Element Handle (or Endpoint Handle):  A logical pointer to a
      particular Pool Element in a pool, consisting of the Pool Handle
      and a destination transport address of the Pool Element.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Handlespace:  A cohesive structure of Pool Handles and relations that
      may be queried by an internal or external agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Home ENRP Server:  The ENRP server to which a PE or PU currently
      sends all namespace service requests.  A PE must only have one
      Home ENRP server at any given time, and both the PE and its Home
      ENRP server MUST know and keep track of this relationship.  A PU
      should select one of the available ENRP servers as its Home ENRP
      server, but the collective ENRP servers may change this by the
      sending of an ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ENRP Client Channel:  The communication channel through which an ASAP
      User sends all namespace service requests.  The client channel is
      usually defined by the transport address of the Home ENRP server
      and a well-known port number.  The channel MAY make use of
      multicast or a named list of ENRP servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Network Byte Order:  Most significant byte first, aka Big Endian.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Transport Address:  A transport address is traditionally defined by
      Network Layer address, Transport Layer protocol and Transport
      Layer port number.  In the case of SCTP running over IP, a
      transport address is defined by the combination of an IP address
      and an SCTP port number (where SCTP is the Transport protocol).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Conventions</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   Organization of This Document</h3></a>

   Section 2 details the ASAP message formats.  In Section 3, we provide
   detailed ASAP procedures for the ASAP implementer.  Section 4
   summarizes which messages need to be supported by which nodes, and
   Section 5 describes the usage of SCTP.  In Section 6, details of the
   ASAP interface are given, focusing on the communication primitives
   between ASAP, the applications above ASAP, and ASAP itself, and the
   communications primitives between ASAP and SCTP (or other transport
   layers).  Also included in this discussion are relevant timers and
   configurable parameters, as appropriate.  Section 7 provides
   threshold and protocol variables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that variables, timers, and constants are used in
   the text when necessary.  The complete list can be found in
   Section 7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4"><h3>1.4   Scope of ASAP</h3></a>

   The requirements for high availability and scalability do not imply
   requirements on shared state and data.  ASAP does not provide
   transaction failover.  If a host or application fails during the
   processing of a transaction, this transaction may be lost.  Some
   services MAY provide a way to handle the failure, but this is not
   guaranteed.  ASAP MAY provide hooks to assist an application in
   building a mechanism to share state but ASAP in itself does NOT share
   any state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4.1"><h4>1.4.1   Extent of the Handlespace</h4></a>

   The scope of ASAP/ENRP is NOT Internet-wide.  The handlespace is
   neither hierarchical nor arbitrarily large like DNS.  A flat peer-to-
   peer model is detailed.  Pools of servers will exist in different
   administrative domains.  For example, suppose the use of ASAP and
   ENRP is wanted.  First, the PU may use DNS to contact an ENRP server.
   Suppose a PU in North America wishes to contact a server pool in
   Japan instead of North America.  The PU would use DNS to get the list
   of IP addresses of the Japanese server pool; that is, the ENRP client
   channel in Japan.  From there, the PU would query the Home ENRP
   server it established and then directly contact the PE(s) of
   interest.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Message Definitions</h2></a>

   All messages, as well as their fields described below, shall be in
   network byte order during transmission.  For fields with a length
   bigger than 4 bytes, a number in a pair of parentheses may follow the
   field name to indicate the length of the field in number of bytes.
	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   ASAP Parameter Formats</h3></a>

   The basic message format and all parameter formats can be found in
   [RFC5354].  Note also that *all* ASAP messages exchanged between an
   ENRP server and a PE MUST use SCTP as transport, while ASAP messages
   exchanged between an ENRP server and a PU MUST use either SCTP or TCP
   as transport.  PE to PU data traffic MAY use any transport protocol
   specified by the PE during registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   ASAP Messages</h3></a>

   This section details the individual messages used by ASAP.  These
   messages are composed of a standard message format found in Section 4
   of [RFC5354].  The parameter descriptions can be found in [RFC5354].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following ASAP message types are defined in this section:

   The ASAP_REGISTRATION message is sent by a PE to its Home ENRP server
   to either create a new pool or to add itself to an existing pool.
   The PE sending the ASAP_REGISTRATION message MUST fill in the Pool
   Handle parameter and the Pool Element parameter.  The Pool Handle
   parameter specifies the name to be registered.  The Pool Element
   parameter MUST be filled in by the registrant, as outlined in
   Section 3.1.  Note that the PE sending the registration message MUST
   send the message using an SCTP association.  Furthermore, the IP
   address(es) of the PE that is registered within the Pool Element
   parameter MUST be a subset of the IP address(es) used in the SCTP
   association, regardless of the registered transport protocol.

   Operational Error Parameter:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   See [RFC5354].
   When an ASAP Endpoint receives an ASAP message with an unknown
   message type or a message of known type that contains an unknown
   parameter, it SHOULD handle the unknown message or the unknown
   parameter according to the unrecognized message and parameter
   handling rules, defined in Section 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   According to the rules, if an error report to the message sender is
   needed, the ASAP endpoint that discovered the error SHOULD send back
   an ASAP_ERROR message that includes an Operational Error parameter
   with the proper cause code, cause length, and case-specific
   information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Procedures</h2></a>

   This section will focus on the methods and procedures used by an
   internal ASAP Endpoint.  Appropriate timers and recovery actions for
   failure detection and management are also discussed.  Also, please
   note that ASAP messages sent between a PE and PU are identified by an
   SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Registration</h3></a>

   When a PE wishes to initiate or join a server pool, it MUST use the
   procedures outlined in this section for registration.  Often, the
   registration will be triggered by a user request primitive (discussed
   in Section 6.1).  The PE MUST register using an SCTP association
   established between itself and the Home ENRP server.  If the PE has
   not established its Home ENRP server, it MUST follow the procedures
   specified in Section 3.6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once the PE's ASAP Endpoint has established its Home ENRP server, the
   following procedures MUST be followed to register:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R1)  The PE's SCTP endpoint used to communicate with the Home ENRP
      server MUST be bound to all IP addresses that will be used by the
      PE (regardless of which transport protocol will be used to service
      user requests to the PE).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R2)  The PE's ASAP Endpoint MUST formulate an ASAP_REGISTRATION
      message, as defined in Section 2.2.1.  In formulating the message,
      the PE MUST:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      R2.1)  Fill in the Pool Handle parameter to specify which server
         pool the ASAP Endpoint wishes to join.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      R2.2)  Fill in the PE identifier using a good-quality randomly
         generated number ([RFC4086] provides some information on
         randomness guidelines).
      R2.3)  Fill in the Registration Lifetime parameter with the number
         of seconds that this registration is valid for.  Note that a PE
         that wishes to continue service MUST re-register before the
         registration expires.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      R2.4)  Fill in a User Transport parameter to specify the type of
         transport and the data/control channel usage the PE is willing
         to support.  Note, in joining an existing server pool, the PE
         MUST follow the overall transport type and overall data/control
         channel usage of the pool.  Otherwise, the registration may be
         rejected by the ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      R2.5)  Fill in the preferred Pool Member Selection Policy
         parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R3)  Send the ASAP_REGISTRATION message to the Home ENRP server using
      SCTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R4)  Start a T2-registration timer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note: the PE does not need to fill in the optional ASAP transport
   parameter.  The ASAP transport parameter will be filled in and used
   by the Home ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the T2-registration timer expires before receiving an
   ASAP_REGISTRATION_RESPONSE message, or a SEND.FAILURE notification is
   received from the SCTP layer, the PE shall start the Server Hunt
   procedure (see Section 3.6) in an attempt to get service from a
   different ENRP server.  After establishing a new Home ENRP server,
   the PE SHOULD restart the registration procedure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At the reception of the registration response, the PE MUST stop the
   T2-registration timer.  If the response indicates success, the PE is
   registered and will be considered an available member of the server
   pool.  If the registration response indicates a failure, the PE must
   either re-attempt registration after correcting the error or return a
   failure indication to the PE's upper layer.  The PE MUST NOT re-
   attempt registration without correcting the error condition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At any time, a registered PE MAY wish to re-register to either update
   its member selection Policy Value or registration expiration time.
   When re-registering, the PE MUST use the same PE identifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After successful registration, the PE MUST start a T4-reregistration
   timer.  At its expiration, a re-registration SHOULD be made starting
   at step R1, including (at completion) restarting the T4-
   reregistration timer.
   Note that an implementation SHOULD keep a record of the number of
   registration (and re-registration) attempts it makes in a local
   variable that gets set to zero before the initial registration
   attempt to the Home ENRP server or after a successful re-
   registration.  If repeated registration timeouts or failures occurs
   and the local count exceeds the Threshold 'MAX-REG-ATTEMPT', the
   implementation SHOULD report the error to its upper layer and stop
   attempting registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ENRP server handles the ASAP_REGISTRATION message according to
   the following rules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If the named pool does not exist in the handlespace, the ENRP
       server MUST create a new pool with that handle in the handlespace
       and add the PE to the pool as its first PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       When a new pool is created, the overall member selection policy
       of the pool MUST be set to the policy type indicated by the first
       PE, the overall pool transport type MUST be set to the transport
       type indicated by the PE, and the overall pool data/control
       channel configuration MUST be set to what is indicated in the
       Transport Use field of the User Transport parameter by the
       registering PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  If the named pool already exists in the handlespace, but the
       requesting PE is not currently a member of the pool, the ENRP
       server will add the PE as a new member to the pool.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       However, before adding the PE to the pool, the server MUST check
       if the policy type, transport type, and transport usage indicated
       by the registering PE is consistent with those of the pool.  If
       different, the ENRP server MUST reject the registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  If the named pool already exists in the handlespace *and* the
       requesting PE is already a member of the pool, the ENRP server
       SHOULD consider this as a re-registration case.  The ENRP server
       MUST perform the same tests on policy, transport type, and
       transport use, as described above.  If the re-registration is
       accepted after the test, the ENRP server SHOULD replace the
       attributes of the existing PE with the information carried in the
       received ASAP_REGISTRATION message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  After accepting the registration, the ENRP server MUST assign
       itself the owner of this PE.  If this is a re-registration, the
       ENRP server MUST take over ownership of this PE, regardless of
       whether the PE was previously owned by this server or by another
       server.  The ENRP server MUST also record the SCTP transport
       address from which it received the ASAP_REGISTRATION in the ASAP
       Transport parameter TLV inside the PE parameter of this PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  The ENRP server may reject the registration due to other reasons
       such as invalid values, lack of resource, authentication failure,
       etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In all above cases, the ENRP server MUST reply to the requesting PE
   with an ASAP_REGISTRATION_RESPONSE message.  If the registration is
   accepted, the ENRP server MUST set the R flag in the
   ASAP_REGISTRATION_RESPONSE to '0'.  If the registration is rejected,
   the ENRP server MUST indicate the rejection by setting the R flag in
   the ASAP_REGISTRATION_RESPONSE to '1'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the registration is rejected, the ENRP server SHOULD include the
   proper error cause(s) in the ASAP_REGISTRATION_RESPONSE message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the registration is granted (either a new registration or a re-
   registration case), the ENRP server MUST assign itself to be the Home
   ENRP server of the PE, i.e., to "own" the PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Implementation note: For better performance, the ENRP server may
      find it both efficient and convenient to internally maintain two
      separate PE lists or tables -- one is for the PEs that are owned
      by the ENRP server and the other is for all the PEs owned by their
      peer(s).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Moreover, if the registration is granted, the ENRP server MUST take
   the handlespace update action to inform its peers about the change
   just made.  If the registration is denied, no message will be sent to
   its peers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   De-Registration</h3></a>

   In the event a PE wishes to de-register from its server pool
   (normally, via an upper-layer request, see Section 6.2), it SHOULD
   use the following procedure.  It should be noted that an alternate
   method of de-registration is to NOT re-register and to allow the
   registration life of the PE to expire.  In this case, an
   ASAP_DEREGISTRATION_RESPONSE message is sent to the PE's ASAP
   Endpoint to indicate the removal of the PE from the pool it
   registered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When de-registering, the PE SHOULD use the SCTP association that was
   used for registration with its Home ENRP server.  To de-register, the
   PE's ASAP Endpoint MUST take the following actions:
   D1)  Fill in the Pool Handle parameter of the ASAP_DEREGISTRATION
      message (Section 2.2.2) using the same Pool Handle parameter sent
      during registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   D2)  Fill in the PE Identifier parameter of the ASAP_DEREGISTRATION
      message.  The identifier MUST be the same as used during
      registration.  The use of the same Pool Handle and Pool Identifier
      parameters used in registration allows the identity of the PE ASAP
      Endpoint to be verified before de-registration can occur.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   D3)  Send the ASAP_DEREGISTRATION message to the Home ENRP server
      using the PE's SCTP association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   D4)  Start a T3-Deregistration timer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the T3-Deregistration timer expires before receiving either an
   ASAP_REGISTRATION_RESPONSE message, or a SEND.FAILURE notification
   from the PE's SCTP endpoint, the PE's ASAP Endpoint shall start the
   ENRP Server Hunt procedure (see Section 3.6) in an attempt to get
   service from another ENRP server.  After establishing a new Home ENRP
   server, the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD restart the de-registration
   procedure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At the reception of the ASAP_DEREGISTRATION_RESPONSE, the PE's ASAP
   endpoint MUST stop the T3-Deregistration timer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that after a successful de-registration, the PE
   MAY still receive requests for some period of time.  The PE MAY wish
   to remain active and service these requests or to exit and ignore
   these requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receiving the message, the ENRP server SHALL remove the PE from
   its handlespace.  Moreover, if the PE is the last one of the named
   pool, the ENRP server will remove the pool from the handlespace as
   well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the ENRP server fails to find any record of the PE in its
   handlespace, it SHOULD consider the de-registration granted and
   completed, and send an ASAP_DEREGISTRATION_RESPONSE message to the
   PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ENRP server may reject the de-registration request for various
   reasons, such as invalid parameters, authentication failure, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In response, the ENRP server MUST send an
   ASAP_DEREGISTRATION_RESPONSE message to the PE.  If the de-
   registration is rejected, the ENRP server MUST indicate the rejection
   by including the proper Operational Error parameter.
   It should be noted that de-registration does not stop the PE from
   sending or receiving application messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once the de-registration request is granted *and* the PE removed from
   its local copy of the handlespace, the ENRP server MUST take the
   handlespace update action to inform its peers about the change just
   made.  Otherwise, the ENRP server MUST NOT inform its peers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Handle Resolution</h3></a>

   At any time, a PE or PU may wish to resolve a handle.  This usually
   will occur when an ASAP Endpoint sends a Pool Handle (Section 6.5.1)
   to its Home ENRP server or requests a cache population (Section 6.3).
   It may also occur for other reasons (e.g., the internal ASAP PE
   wishes to know its peers to send a message to all of them).  When an
   ASAP Endpoint (PE or PU) wishes to resolve a pool handle to a list of
   accessible transport addresses of the member PEs of the pool, it MUST
   take the following actions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NR1)  Fill in an ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION message (Section 2.2.5) with
      the Pool Handle to be resolved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NR2)  If the endpoint does not have a Home ENRP server, start the
      ENRP Server Hunt procedures specified in Section 3.6 to obtain
      one.  Otherwise, proceed to step NR3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NR3)  If a PE, send the ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION message to the Home
      ENRP server using SCTP; if a PU, send the ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION
      message to the Home ENRP server using either TCP or SCTP.  If sent
      from a PE, the SCTP association used for registration SHOULD be
      used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NR4)  Start a T1-ENRPrequest timer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the T1-ENRPrequest timer expires before receiving a response
   message, the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD take the steps described in
   Section 3.7.2.  If a SEND.FAILURE notification is received from the
   SCTP or TCP layer, the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD start the Server Hunt
   procedure (see Section 3.6) in an attempt to get service from a
   different ENRP server.  After establishing a new Home ENRP server,
   the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD restart the handle resolution procedure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At the reception of the ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION_RESPONSE message, the
   ASAP Endpoint MUST stop its T1-ENRPrequest timer.  After stopping the
   T1-ENRPrequest timer, the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD process the message as
   appropriate (e.g., populate a local cache, give the response to the
   ASAP User, and/or use the response to send the ASAP User's message).
   Note that some ASAP Endpoints MAY use a cache to minimize the number
   of handle resolutions sent.  If a cache is used, it SHOULD:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   C1)  Be consulted before sending a handle resolution.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   C2)  Have a stale timeout timer associated with each cache entry.  If
      the cache entry is determined to be stale upon a cache hit, a
      handle resolution message SHOULD be sent so the cache can be
      updated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   C3)  In the case of a stale cache entry, the implementation may, in
      parallel, update the cache and answer the request, or it may block
      the user and wait for an updated cache before proceeding with the
      users request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   C4)  If the cache entry is NOT stale, the endpoint SHOULD NOT send a
      handle resolution request but instead SHOULD use the entry from
      the cache.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that the impact of using a cache depends on the
   policy and the requirements of the application.  For some
   applications, cache-usage can increase the performance of the system;
   for some, it can decrease it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An ENRP server SHOULD be prepared to receive ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION
   requests from PUs, either over an SCTP association on the well-known
   SCTP port, or over a TCP connection on the well-known TCP port.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon reception of the ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION message, the ENRP server
   MUST first look up the pool handle in its handlespace.  If the pool
   exists, the Home ENRP server MUST compose and send back an
   ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION_RESPONSE message to the requesting PU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the response message, the ENRP server SHOULD list all the PEs
   currently registered in this pool, in a list of PE parameters.  The
   ENRP server MUST also include a pool member selection policy
   parameter to indicate the overall member selection policy for the
   pool, if the current pool member selection policy is not Round-Robin.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the named pool does not exist in the handlespace, the ENRP server
   MUST reject the handle resolution request by responding with an
   ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION_RESPONSE message carrying an Unknown Pool
   Handle error.
	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Endpoint Keep Alive</h3></a>

   The ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message is sent by an ENRP server to a
   PE in order to verify it is reachable.  If the transport level
   heartbeat mechanism is insufficient, this message can be used in a
   heartbeat mechanism for the ASAP level whose goal is determining the
   health status of the ASAP level in a timely fashion.  (The transport
   level heartbeat mechanism may be insufficient due to either the
   timeouts or the heartbeat interval being set too long, or, that the
   transport level heartbeat mechanism's coverage is limited only to the
   transport level at the two ends.)  Additionally, the
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message has value in the reliability of
   fault detection if the SCTP stack is in the kernel.  In such a case,
   while the SCTP-level heartbeat monitors the end-to-end connectivity
   between the two SCTP stacks, the ASAP-level heartbeat monitors the
   end-to-end liveliness of the ASAP layer above it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of the ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message (Section 2.2.7) and
   the ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE_ACK (Section 2.2.8) is described below.
   Upon reception of an ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message, the following
   actions MUST be taken:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   KA1)  The PE must verify that the Pool Handle is correct and matches
      the Pool Handle sent in its earlier ASAP_REGISTRATION message.  If
      the Pool Handle does not match, the PE MUST silently discard the
      message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   KA2)  Send an ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE_ACK (Section 2.2.8) as
      follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      KA2.1)  Fill in the Pool Handle parameter with the PE's Pool
         Handle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      KA2.2)  Fill in the PE Identifier parameter using the PE
         identifier used by this PE for registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      KA2.3)  Send the ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE_ACK message via the
         appropriate SCTP association for the ENRP server that sent the
         ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      KA2.4)  If the H flag in the received ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE
         message is set, and the Server Identifier in the message is NOT
         the identity of your Home ENRP server (or it is not set, e.g.,
         you have a no Home ENRP server) adopt the sender of the
         ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message as the new Home ENRP server.
	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5   Unreachable Endpoints</h3></a>

   Occasionally, an ASAP Endpoint may realize a PE is unreachable.  This
   may occur by a specific SCTP error realized by the ASAP endpoint or
   via an ASAP User report via the Transport.Failure Primitive
   (Section 6.9.2).  In either case, the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD report the
   unavailability of the PE by sending an ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE
   message to any ENRP server.  Before sending the
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE message, the ASAP Endpoint should fill in
   the Pool Handle parameter and PE Identifier parameter of the
   unreachable endpoint.  If the sender is a PE, the message MUST be
   sent via SCTP.  It should be noted that an ASAP Endpoint MUST report
   no more than once each time it encounters such an event.
   Additionally, when processing a Transport.Failure Primitive
   (Section 6.9.2), the ASAP Endpoint MUST NOT send an
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE message unless the user has made a previous
   request to send data to the PE specified by the primitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon the reception of an ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE message, an ENRP
   server MUST immediately send a point-to-point
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message to the PE in question (the H flag in
   the message SHOULD be set to '0', in this case).  If this
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE fails (e.g., it results in an SCTP
   SEND.FAILURE notification), the ENRP server MUST consider the PE as
   truly unreachable and MUST remove the PE from its handlespace.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message is transmitted successfully
   to the PE, the ENRP server MUST retain the PE in its handlespace.
   Moreover, the server SHOULD keep a counter to record how many
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE messages it has received reporting
   reachability problem relating to this PE.  If the counter exceeds the
   protocol threshold MAX-BAD-PE-REPORT, the ENRP server SHOULD remove
   the PE from its handlespace.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Optionally, an ENRP server may also periodically send point-to-point
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE (with the H flag set to '0') messages to
   each of the PEs owned by the ENRP server in order to check their
   reachability status.  If the sending of ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE to a
   PE fails, the ENRP server MUST consider the PE as unreachable and
   MUST remove the PE from its handlespace.  Note, if an ENRP server
   owns a large number of PEs, the implementation should pay attention
   not to flood the network with bursts of ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE
   messages.  Instead, the implementation MUST distribute the
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE message traffic over a time period.  This
   can be achieved by varying the time between two
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE messages to the same PE randomly by plus/
   minus 50 percent.
	<a name="section-3.6"><h3>3.6   ENRP Server Hunt Procedures</h3></a>

   Each PU and PE manages a list of transport addresses of ENRP servers
   it knows about.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If multicast capabilities are used within the operational scope, an
   ENRP server MUST send periodically every (N+1)*T6-Serverannounce an
   ASAP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE message (Section 2.2.10), which includes all the
   transport addresses available for ASAP communication on the multicast
   ENRP client channel, where N is the number of ENRP servers the server
   has found via receiving ASAP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE messages.  This should
   result in a message rate of approximately 1 ASAP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE per
   T6-Serverannounce.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an ASAP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE message is received by a PU or PE, it
   SHOULD insert all new included transport addresses into its list of
   ENRP server addresses and start a T7-ENRPoutdate timer for each
   address.  For all already-known, included transport addresses, the
   T7-ENRPoutdate timer MUST be restarted for each address.  If no
   transport parameters are included in the ASAP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE
   message, the SCTP transport protocol is assumed to be used and the
   source IP address and the IANA-registered ASAP port number is used
   for communication with the ENRP server.  If a T7-ENRPoutdate timer
   for a transport address expires, the corresponding address is deleted
   from the managed list of transport addresses of the PU or PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If multicast capabilities are not used within the operational scope,
   each PU and PE MUST have a configured list of transport addresses of
   ENRP servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At its startup, or when it fails to communicate with its Home ENRP
   server (i.e., timed out on an ENRP request), a PE or PU MUST
   establish a new Home ENRP server (i.e., set up a TCP connection or
   SCTP association with a different ENRP server).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To establish a Home ENRP server, the following rules MUST be
   followed:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SH1)  The PE or PU SHOULD try to establish an association or

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SH2)  The ASAP Endpoint shall start a T5-Serverhunt timer.
   SH3)  If the ASAP Endpoint establishes an association or connection

   Three types of failure may occur when the ASAP Endpoint at either the
   PE or PU tries to communicate with an ENRP server:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A) SCTP send failure

   B) T1-ENRPrequest timer expiration

   C) Registration failure

	<a name="section-3.7.1"><h4>3.7.1   SCTP Send Failure</h4></a>

   This communication failure indicates that the SCTP layer was unable
   to deliver a message sent to an ENRP server.  In other words, the
   ENRP server is unreachable.
   In such a case, the ASAP Endpoint MUST NOT re-send the undeliverable
   message.  Instead, it SHOULD discard the message and start the ENRP
   Server Hunt procedure as described in Section 3.6.  After finding a
   new Home ENRP server, the ASAP Endpoint should re-send the request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that an ASAP Endpoint MAY also choose to NOT discard the
   message, but to queue it for retransmission after a new Home ENRP
   server is found.  If an ASAP Endpoint does choose to discard the
   message, after a new Home ENRP server is found, the ASAP Endpoint
   MUST be capable of reconstructing the original request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.7.2"><h4>3.7.2   T1-ENRPrequest Timer Expiration</h4></a>

   When the T1-ENRPrequest timer expires, the ASAP Endpoint should re-
   send the original request to the ENRP server and restart the T1-
   ENRPrequest timer.  In parallel, the ASAP Endpoint should begin the
   ENRP server hunt procedures described in Section 3.6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This should be repeated up to MAX-REQUEST-RETRANSMIT times.  After
   that, an Error.Report notification should be generated to inform the
   ASAP User, and the ENRP request message associated with the T1-
   ENRPrequest timer should be discarded.  It should be noted that if an
   alternate ENRP server responds, the ASAP Endpoint SHOULD adopt the
   responding ENRP server as its new Home ENRP server and re-send the
   request to the new Home ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.7.3"><h4>3.7.3   Registration Failure</h4></a>

   Registration failure is discussed in Section 3.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.8"><h3>3.8   Cookie Handling Procedures</h3></a>

   Whenever a PE wants, and a control channel exists, it can send an
   ASAP_COOKIE message to a PU via the control channel.  The PU's ASAP
   endpoint stores the Cookie parameter and discards an older cookie if
   it is previously stored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note: A control channel is a communication channel between a PU and
   PE that does not carry data passed to the user.  This is accomplished
   with SCTP by using a PPID to separate the ASAP messages (Cookie and
   Business Card) from normal data messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the PU's ASAP Endpoint detects a failure and initiates a failover
   to a different PE, it SHOULD send the latest received cookie
   parameter in an ASAP_COOKIE_ECHO message to the new PE as the first
   message on the control channel.  Upper layers may be involved in the
   failover procedure.
   The cookie handling procedure can be used for state sharing.
   Therefore, a cookie should be signed by the sending PE ASAP Endpoint
   and the cookie should be verified by the receiving PE's ASAP
   Endpoint.  The details of the verification procedure are out of scope
   for this document.  It is only important that the PU always stores
   the last received Cookie parameter and sends that back unmodified in
   case of a PE failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.9"><h3>3.9   Business Card Handling Procedures</h3></a>

   When communication begins between a PU and a PE, either of which
   could be part of a PU/PE combination (i.e., a message is sent between
   the entities), a PE should always send an ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message
   to a PU.  A PU should send an ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message to a PE only
   if it is part of a PU/PE combination.  An ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message
   MUST ONLY be sent if a control channel exists between a PU and PE.
   After communication has been established between a PE and PU, a new
   ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message may be sent at any time by either entity
   to update its failover order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message serves two purposes.  First, it lists
   the pool handle.  For a PU that is part of a PU/PE combination that
   is contacting a PE, this is essential so that the PE learns the pool
   handle of the PU/PE combination requesting service.  Secondly, the
   ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message tells the receiving entity a failover
   order that is recommended to follow.  This should facilitate
   rendezvous between entities that have been working together, as well
   as to control the load redistribution upon the failure of any PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of an ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message (see Section 2.2.13),
   the receiving ASAP Endpoint SHOULD:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   BC1)  Unpack the message, and if no entry exists in the translation
      cache of the receiving ASAP Endpoint for the pool handle listed
      within the ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message, perform an
      ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION for that pool handle.  If the translation
      cache does hold an entry for the pool handle, then it may be
      necessary to update the peer endpoint.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   BC2)  Unpack the message and populate a preferred list for failover
      order.  If the peer's PE should fail, this preferred list will be
      used to guide the ASAP Endpoint in the selection of an alternate
      PE.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Roles of Endpoints</h2></a>

   A PU MUST implement the handling of ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION and
   ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION_RESPONSE messages.  Furthermore, it MUST

   messages.  It MAY also implement the handling of ASAP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE
   messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PE MUST implement the handling of ASAP_REGISTRATION,

   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE_ACK, ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE, and
   ASAP_ERROR messages.  It SHOULD support the handling of ASAP_COOKIE,
   ASAP_COOKIE_ECHO, and ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD messages.  Furthermore, it

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   SCTP Considerations</h2></a>

   Each ASAP message is considered as an SCTP user message.  The PPID

   Note, the following primitive and notification descriptions are shown

   The Pool Handle parameter contains a NULL terminated ASCII string of
   fixed length.  The optional User Transport parameter(s) indicates
   specific transport parameters and types with which to register.  If
   this optional parameter is left off, then the SCTP endpoint used to
   communicate with the ENRP server is used as the default User
   Transport parameter.  Note that any IP address contained within a
   User Transport parameter MUST be a bound IP address in the SCTP
   endpoint used to communicate with the ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ASAP User invokes this primitive to add itself to the
   handlespace, thus becoming a Pool Element of a pool.  The ASAP User
   must register itself with the ENRP server by using this primitive
   before other ASAP Users using the handlespace can send message(s) to
   this ASAP User by Pool Handle or by PE handle (see Sections 6.5.1 and

   If the address type is a Pool Handle and a local handle translation

   and updating its local cache when the response comes back from the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a Pool-Element-Handle is passed, then the Pool Handle is unpacked
   from the Pool-Element-Handle and the ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION message

   If the user passes a Pool Handle and local handle translation cache
   exists, the ASAP Endpoint should remove the mapping information on
   the Pool Handle from its local cache.  If the user passes a Pool-

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Depending on the address type used for the send request, the sender's

	<a name="section-6.5.1"><h4>6.5.1   Sending to a Pool Handle</h4></a>

   In this case, the destinationAddress and typeOfAddress together
   indicate a pool handle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is the simplest form of send_data_request primitive.  By
   default, this directs ASAP to send the message to one of the Pool

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Optionally, the ASAP Endpoint of the sender may return a Pool Element
   handle of the selected PE to the application after sending the
   message.  This PE handle can then be used for future transmissions to
   that same PE (see Section 6.5.3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 3.7 defines the failover procedures for cases where the
   selected PE is found unreachable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5.2"><h4>6.5.2   Pool Element Selection</h4></a>

   Each time an ASAP User sends a message to a pool that contains more
   than one PE, the sender's ASAP Endpoint must select one of the PEs in
   the pool as the receiver of the current message.  The selection is
   made according to the current server pooling policy of the pool to
   which the message is sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note, no selection is needed if the ASAP_SEND_TOALL option is set
   (see Section 6.5.5).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Together with the server pooling policy, each PE can also specify a

   will select the receiver for each outbound message by Round-Robining
   through all the registered PEs in that Pool, in an attempt to achieve
   an even distribution of outbound messages.  Note that in a large
   server pool, the ENRP server might not send back all PEs to the ASAP

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5.3"><h4>6.5.3   Sending to a Pool Element Handle</h4></a>

   In this case, the destinationAddress and typeOfAddress together

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Pool Element handle should contain the Pool Handle and a
   destination transport address of the destination PE or the Pool
   Handle and the transport type.  Other implementation dependent
   elements may also be cached in a Pool Element handle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ASAP Endpoint shall use the transport address and transport type
   to identify the endpoint with which to communicate.  If no

   protocol to send the message to the PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, if a local translation cache is supported, the endpoint
   will:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A) send out the message to the transport address (or association id)

	<a name="section-9.1"><h3>9.1   Summary of RSerPool Security Threats</h3></a>

   "Threats Introduced by Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) and
   Requirements for Security in Response to Threats" [RFC5355] describes
   the threats to the RSerPool architecture in detail and lists the
   security requirements in response to each threat.  From the threats
   described in this document, the security services required for the
   RSerPool protocol are enumerated below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 1) PE registration/de-registration flooding or spoofing.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: ENRP server authenticates the PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 2) PE registers with a malicious ENRP server.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: PE authenticates the ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threats 1 and 2, taken together, result in mutual authentication of

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 3) Malicious ENRP server joins the ENRP server pool.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: ENRP servers mutually authenticate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 4) A PU communicates with a malicious ENRP server for handle
   resolution.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: The PU authenticates the ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 5) Replay attack.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: Security protocol that has protection
   from replay attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 6) Corrupted data that causes a PU to have misinformation
   concerning a pool handle resolution.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: Security protocol that supports
   integrity protection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 7) Eavesdropper snooping on handlespace information.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: Security protocol that supports data
   confidentiality.
   Threat 8) Flood of ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE messages from the PU to
   ENRP server.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: ASAP must control the number of ASAP
   Endpoint unreachable messages transmitted from the PU to the ENRP
   server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 9) Flood of ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE messages to the PE from
   the ENRP server.
   -----------
   Security mechanism in response: ENRP server must control the number
   of ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE messages to the PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To summarize, the threats 1-7 require security mechanisms that
   support authentication, integrity, data confidentiality, and
   protection from replay attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For RSerPool we need to authenticate the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      PU <----  ENRP server (PU authenticates the ENRP server)
      PE <----> ENRP server (mutual authentication)
      ENRP server <-----> ENRP server (mutual authentication)

	<a name="section-9.2"><h3>9.2   Implementing Security Mechanisms</h3></a>

   We do not define any new security mechanisms specifically for
   responding to threats 1-7.  Rather, we use an existing IETF security
   protocol, specifically [RFC3237], to provide the security services
   required.  TLS supports all these requirements and MUST be
   implemented.  The TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite MUST be
   supported, at a minimum, by implementers of TLS for RSerPool.  For
   purposes of backwards compatibility, ENRP SHOULD support
   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA.  Implementers MAY also support any
   other IETF-approved ciphersuites.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ENRP servers, PEs, and PUs MUST implement TLS.  ENRP servers and PEs
   MUST support mutual authentication using PSK (pre-shared-key).  ENRP
   servers MUST support mutual authentication among themselves using
   PSK.  PUs MUST authenticate ENRP servers using certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TLS with PSK is mandatory to implement as the authentication
   mechanism for ENRP to ENRP authentication and PE to ENRP
   authentication.  For PSK, having a pre-shared-key constitutes
   authorization.  The network administrators of a pool need to decide
   which nodes are authorized to participate in the pool.  The
   justification for PSK is that we assume that one administrative
   domain will control and manage the server pool.  This allows for PSK
   to be implemented and managed by a central security administrator.
   TLS with certificates is mandatory to implement as the authentication
   mechanism for PUs to the ENRP server.  PUs MUST authenticate ENRP
   servers using certificates.  ENRP servers MUST possess a site
   certificate whose subject corresponds to their canonical hostname.
   PUs MAY have certificates of their own for mutual authentication with
   TLS, but no provisions are set forth in this document for their use.
   All RSerPool Elements that support TLS MUST have a mechanism for
   validating certificates received during TLS negotiation; this entails
   possession of one or more root certificates issued by certificate
   authorities (preferably, well-known distributors of site certificates
   comparable to those that issue root certificates for web browsers).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the client MUST verify
   the server's identity (as presented in the server's Certificate
   message).  The client's understanding of the server's identity
   (typically, the identity used to establish the transport connection)
   is called the "reference identity".  The client determines the type
   (e.g., DNS name or IP address) of the reference identity and performs
   a comparison between the reference identity and each subjectAltName
   value of the corresponding type until a match is produced.  Once a
   match is produced, the server's identity has been verified, and the
   server identity check is complete.  Different subjectAltName types
   are matched in different ways.  The client may map the reference
   identity to a different type prior to performing a comparison.
   Mappings may be performed for all available subjectAltName types to
   which the reference identity can be mapped; however, the reference
   identity should only be mapped to types for which the mapping is
   either inherently secure (e.g., extracting the DNS name from a URI to
   compare with a subjectAltName of type dNSName) or for which the
   mapping is performed in a secure manner (e.g., using DNS Security
   (DNSSEC), or using user- or admin-configured host-to-address/
   address-to-host lookup tables).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the server identity check fails, user-oriented clients SHOULD
   either notify the user or close the transport connection and indicate
   that the server's identity is suspect.  Automated clients SHOULD
   close the transport connection and then return or log an error
   indicating that the server's identity is suspect, or both.  Beyond
   the server identity check described in this section, clients should
   be prepared to do further checking to ensure that the server is
   authorized to provide the service it is requested to provide.  The
   client may need to make use of local policy information in making
   this determination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the reference identity is an internationalized domain name,
   conforming implementations MUST convert it to the ASCII Compatible
   Encoding (ACE) format, as specified in Section 4 of [RFC3490], before
   comparison with subjectAltName values of type dNSName.  Specifically,
   conforming implementations MUST perform the conversion operation
   specified in Section 4 of [RFC3490] as follows: * in step 1, the
   domain name SHALL be considered a "stored string"; * in step 3, set
   the flag called "UseSTD3ASCIIRules"; * in step 4, process each label
   with the "ToASCII" operation; and * in step 5, change all label
   separators to U+002E (full stop).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After performing the "to-ASCII" conversion, the DNS labels and names
   MUST be compared for equality, according to the rules specified in
   Section 3 of RFC 3490.  The '*' (ASCII 42) wildcard character is
   allowed in subjectAltName values of type dNSName, and then, only as
   the left-most (least significant) DNS label in that value.  This
   wildcard matches any left-most DNS label in the server name.  That
   is, the subject *.example.com matches the server names a.example.com
   and b.example.com, but does not match example.com or a.b.example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the reference identity is an IP address, the identity MUST be
   converted to the "network byte order" octet string representation in
   [RFC0791] and [RFC2460].  For IP version 4, as specified in RFC 791,
   the octet string will contain exactly four octets.  For IP version 6,
   as specified in RFC 2460, the octet string will contain exactly
   sixteen octets.  This octet string is then compared against
   subjectAltName values of type iPAddress.  A match occurs if the
   reference identity octet string and value octet strings are
   identical.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After a TLS layer is established in a session, both parties are to
   independently decide whether or not to continue based on local policy
   and the security level achieved.  If either party decides that the
   security level is inadequate for it to continue, it SHOULD remove the
   TLS layer immediately after the TLS (re)negotiation has completed
   (see RFC 4511)[RFC4511].  Implementations may re-evaluate the
   security level at any time and, upon finding it inadequate, should
   remove the TLS layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations MUST support TLS with SCTP, as described in [RFC3436]
   or TLS over TCP, as described in [RFC5246].  When using TLS/SCTP we
   must ensure that RSerPool does not use any features of SCTP that are
   not available to a TLS/SCTP user.  This is not a difficult technical
   problem, but simply a requirement.  When describing an API of the
   RSerPool lower layer, we also have to take into account the
   differences between TLS and SCTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Threat 8 requires the ASAP protocol to limit the number of
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE messages (see Section 3.5) to the ENRP
   server.
   Threat 9 requires the ENRP protocol to limit the number of
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE messages from the ENRP server to the PE (see
   [RFC5353]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no security mechanism defined for the multicast
   announcements.  Therefore, a receiver of such an announcement cannot
   consider the source address of such a message to be a trustworthy
   address of an ENRP server.  A receiver must also be prepared to
   receive a large number of multicast announcements from attackers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.3"><h3>9.3   Chain of Trust</h3></a>

   Security is mandatory to implement in RSerPool and is based on TLS
   implementation in all three architecture components that comprise
   RSerPool -- namely PU, PE, and ENRP server.  We define an ENRP server
   that uses TLS for all communication and authenticates ENRP peers and
   PE registrants to be a secured ENRP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Here is a description of all possible data paths and a description of
   the security.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PU <---> secured ENRP server (authentication of ENRP server;
            queries over TLS)
   PE <---> secured ENRP server (mutual authentication;
            registration/de-registration over TLS)
   secured ENRP server <---> secured ENRP server (mutual authentication;
            database updates using TLS)

   If all components of the system authenticate and communicate using
   TLS, the chain of trust is sound.  The root of the trust chain is the
   ENRP server.  If that is secured using TLS, then security will be
   enforced for all ENRP and PE components that try to connect to it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Summary of interaction between secured and unsecured components: If
   the PE does not use TLS and tries to register with a secure ENRP
   server, it will receive an error message response indicated as an
   error due to security considerations and the registration will be
   rejected.  If an ENRP server that does not use TLS tries to update
   the database of a secure ENRP server, then the update will be
   rejected.  If a PU does not use TLS and communicates with a secure
   ENRP server, it will get a response with the understanding that the
   response is not secure, as the response can be tampered with in
   transit even if the ENRP database is secured.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The final case is the PU sending a secure request to ENRP.  It might
   be that ENRP and PEs are not secured and this is an allowable
   configuration.  The intent is to secure the communication over the
   Internet between the PU and the ENRP server.
   Summary:

   establish a chain of trust.  Secured PE and ENRP servers reject any
   communications with unsecured ENRP or PE servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the above is enforced, then a chain of trust is established for
   the RSerPool user.
