	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes extensions that may be used to add
   functionality to Transport Layer Security (TLS).  It provides both
   generic extension mechanisms for the TLS handshake client and server
   hellos, and specific extensions using these generic mechanisms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TLS is now used in an increasing variety of operational environments,
   many of which were not envisioned when the original design criteria
   for TLS were determined.  The extensions introduced in this document
   are designed to enable TLS to operate as effectively as possible in
   new environments such as wireless networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Wireless environments often suffer from a number of constraints not
   commonly present in wired environments.  These constraints may
   include bandwidth limitations, computational power limitations,
   memory limitations, and battery life limitations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The extensions described here focus on extending the functionality
   provided by the TLS protocol message formats.  Other issues, such as
   the addition of new cipher suites, are deferred.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Specifically, the extensions described in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Allow TLS clients to provide to the TLS server the name of the
      server they are contacting.  This functionality is desirable in
      order to facilitate secure connections to servers that host
      multiple 'virtual' servers at a single underlying network address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Allow TLS clients and servers to negotiate the maximum fragment
      length to be sent.  This functionality is desirable as a result of
      memory constraints among some clients, and bandwidth constraints
      among some access networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Allow TLS clients and servers to negotiate the use of client
      certificate URLs.  This functionality is desirable in order to
      conserve memory on constrained clients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Allow TLS clients to indicate to TLS servers which CA root keys
      they possess.  This functionality is desirable in order to prevent
      multiple handshake failures involving TLS clients that are only
      able to store a small number of CA root keys due to memory
      limitations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Allow TLS clients and servers to negotiate the use of truncated
      MACs.  This functionality is desirable in order to conserve
      bandwidth in constrained access networks.
   -  Allow TLS clients and servers to negotiate that the server sends
      the client certificate status information (e.g., an Online
      Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [OCSP] response) during a TLS
      handshake.  This functionality is desirable in order to avoid
      sending a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) over a constrained
      access network and therefore save bandwidth.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to support the extensions above, general extension
   mechanisms for the client hello message and the server hello message
   are introduced.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The extensions described in this document may be used by TLS clients
   and servers.  The extensions are designed to be backwards compatible,
   meaning that TLS clients that support the extensions can talk to TLS
   servers that do not support the extensions, and vice versa.  The
   document therefore updates TLS 1.0 [TLS] and TLS 1.1 [TLSbis].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Backwards compatibility is primarily achieved via two considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Clients typically request the use of extensions via the extended
      client hello message described in Section 2.1. TLS requires
      servers to accept extended client hello messages, even if the
      server does not "understand" the extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  For the specific extensions described here, no mandatory server
      response is required when clients request extended functionality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Essentially, backwards compatibility is achieved based on the TLS
   requirement that servers that are not "extensions-aware" ignore data
   added to client hellos that they do not recognize; for example, see
   Section 7.4.1.2 of [TLS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note, however, that although backwards compatibility is supported,
   some constrained clients may be forced to reject communications with
   servers that do not support the extensions as a result of the limited
   capabilities of such clients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document is a revision of the RFC3546 [RFC3546].  The only major
   change concerns the definition of new extensions.  New extensions can
   now be defined via the IETF Consensus Process (rather than requiring
   a standards track RFC).  In addition, a few minor clarifications and
   editorial improvements were made.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   describes general extension mechanisms for the client hello and
   server hello handshake messages.  Section 3 describes specific
   extensions to TLS.  Section 4 describes new error alerts for use with
   the TLS extensions.  The final sections of the document address IPR,
   security considerations, registration of the application/pkix-pkipath
   MIME type, acknowledgements, and references.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Conventions Used in This Document</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   General Extension Mechanisms</h2></a>

   This section presents general extension mechanisms for the TLS
   handshake client hello and server hello messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These general extension mechanisms are necessary in order to enable
   clients and servers to negotiate whether to use specific extensions,
   and how to use specific extensions.  The extension formats described
   are based on [MAILINGLIST].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 2.1 specifies the extended client hello message format,
   Section 2.2 specifies the extended server hello message format, and
   Section 2.3 describes the actual extension format used with the
   extended client and server hellos.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Extended Client Hello</h3></a>

   Clients MAY request extended functionality from servers by sending
   the extended client hello message format in place of the client hello
   message format.  The extended client hello message format is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         struct {
             ProtocolVersion client_version;
             Random random;
             SessionID session_id;
             CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-1>;
             CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
             Extension client_hello_extension_list<0..2^16-1>;
         } ClientHello;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Here the new "client_hello_extension_list" field contains a list of
   extensions.  The actual "Extension" format is defined in Section 2.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the event that a client requests additional functionality using
   the extended client hello, and this functionality is not supplied by
   the server, the client MAY abort the handshake.
   Note that [TLS], Section 7.4.1.2, allows additional information to be
   added to the client hello message.  Thus, the use of the extended
   client hello defined above should not "break" existing TLS servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that supports the extensions mechanism MUST accept only
   client hello messages in either the original or extended ClientHello
   format and (as for all other messages) MUST check that the amount of
   data in the message precisely matches one of these formats.  If it
   does not, then it MUST send a fatal "decode_error" alert.  This
   overrides the "Forward compatibility note" in [TLS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Extended Server Hello</h3></a>

   The extended server hello message format MAY be sent in place of the
   server hello message when the client has requested extended
   functionality via the extended client hello message specified in
   Section 2.1.  The extended server hello message format is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          ProtocolVersion server_version;
          Random random;
          SessionID session_id;
          CipherSuite cipher_suite;
          CompressionMethod compression_method;
          Extension server_hello_extension_list<0..2^16-1>;
      } ServerHello;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Here the new "server_hello_extension_list" field contains a list of
   extensions.  The actual "Extension" format is defined in Section 2.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the extended server hello message is only sent in response
   to an extended client hello message.  This prevents the possibility
   that the extended server hello message could "break" existing TLS
   clients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Hello Extensions</h3></a>

   The extension format for extended client hellos and extended server
   hellos is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          ExtensionType extension_type;
          opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
      } Extension;
   Here:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - "extension_type" identifies the particular extension type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - "extension_data" contains information specific to the particular
     extension type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The extension types defined in this document are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      enum {
          server_name(0), max_fragment_length(1),<br>
          client_certificate_url(2), trusted_ca_keys(3),<br>
          truncated_hmac(4), status_request(5), (65535)<br>
      } ExtensionType;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The list of defined extension types is maintained by the IANA.  The
   current list can be found at:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values.  See
   Sections 5 and 8 for more information on how new values are added.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that for all extension types (including those defined in the
   future), the extension type MUST NOT appear in the extended server
   hello unless the same extension type appeared in the corresponding
   client hello.  Thus clients MUST abort the handshake if they receive
   an extension type in the extended server hello that they did not
   request in the associated (extended) client hello.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Nonetheless, "server-oriented" extensions may be provided in the
   future within this framework.  Such an extension (say, of type x)
   would require the client to first send an extension of type x in the
   (extended) client hello with empty extension_data to indicate that it
   supports the extension type.  In this case, the client is offering
   the capability to understand the extension type, and the server is
   taking the client up on its offer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also note that when multiple extensions of different types are
   present in the extended client hello or the extended server hello,
   the extensions may appear in any order.  There MUST NOT be more than
   one extension of the same type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, note that an extended client hello may be sent both when
   starting a new session and when requesting session resumption.
   Indeed, a client that requests resumption of a session does not in
   general know whether the server will accept this request, and
   therefore it SHOULD send an extended client hello if it would
   normally do so for a new session.  In general the specification of
   each extension type must include a discussion of the effect of the
   extension both during new sessions and during resumed sessions.
	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Extensions to the Handshake Protocol</h3></a>

   This document suggests the use of two new handshake messages,
   "CertificateURL" and "CertificateStatus".  These messages are
   described in Section 3.3 and Section 3.6, respectively.  The new
   handshake message structure therefore becomes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      enum {
          hello_request(0), client_hello(1), server_hello(2),<br>
          certificate(11), server_key_exchange (12),<br>
          certificate_request(13), server_hello_done(14),<br>
          certificate_verify(15), client_key_exchange(16),<br>
          finished(20), certificate_url(21), certificate_status(22),<br>
          (255)
      } HandshakeType;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
          uint24 length;             /* bytes in message */
          select (HandshakeType) {
              case hello_request:       HelloRequest;
              case client_hello:        ClientHello;
              case server_hello:        ServerHello;
              case certificate:         Certificate;
              case server_key_exchange: ServerKeyExchange;
              case certificate_request: CertificateRequest;
              case server_hello_done:   ServerHelloDone;
              case certificate_verify:  CertificateVerify;
              case client_key_exchange: ClientKeyExchange;
              case finished:            Finished;
              case certificate_url:     CertificateURL;
              case certificate_status:  CertificateStatus;
          } body;
      } Handshake;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Specific Extensions</h2></a>

   This section describes the specific TLS extensions specified in this
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that any messages associated with these extensions that are sent
   during the TLS handshake MUST be included in the hash calculations
   involved in "Finished" messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note also that all the extensions defined in this section are
   relevant only when a session is initiated.  When a client includes
   one or more of the defined extension types in an extended client
   hello while requesting session resumption:
   -  If the resumption request is denied, the use of the extensions is
      negotiated as normal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  If, on the other hand, the older session is resumed, then the
      server MUST ignore the extensions and send a server hello
      containing none of the extension types.  In this case, the
      functionality of these extensions negotiated during the original
      session initiation is applied to the resumed session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 3.1 describes the extension of TLS to allow a client to
   indicate which server it is contacting.  Section 3.2 describes the
   extension that provides maximum fragment length negotiation.  Section
   3.3 describes the extension that allows client certificate URLs.
   Section 3.4 describes the extension that allows a client to indicate
   which CA root keys it possesses.  Section 3.5 describes the extension
   that allows the use of truncated HMAC.  Section 3.6 describes the
   extension that supports integration of certificate status information
   messages into TLS handshakes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Server Name Indication</h3></a>

   TLS does not provide a mechanism for a client to tell a server the
   name of the server it is contacting.  It may be desirable for clients
   to provide this information to facilitate secure connections to
   servers that host multiple 'virtual' servers at a single underlying
   network address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to provide the server name, clients MAY include an extension
   of type "server_name" in the (extended) client hello.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain
   "ServerNameList" where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          NameType name_type;
          select (name_type) {
              case host_name: HostName;
          } name;
      } ServerName;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      enum {
          host_name(0), (255)<br>
      } NameType;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      opaque HostName<1..2^16-1>;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          ServerName server_name_list<1..2^16-1>
      } ServerNameList;
   Currently, the only server names supported are DNS hostnames;
   however, this does not imply any dependency of TLS on DNS, and other
   name types may be added in the future (by an RFC that updates this
   document).  TLS MAY treat provided server names as opaque data and
   pass the names and types to the application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "HostName" contains the fully qualified DNS hostname of the server,
   as understood by the client.  The hostname is represented as a byte
   string using UTF-8 encoding [UTF8], without a trailing dot.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the hostname labels contain only US-ASCII characters, then the
   client MUST ensure that labels are separated only by the byte 0x2E,
   representing the dot character U+002E (requirement 1 in Section 3.1
   of [IDNA] notwithstanding).  If the server needs to match the
   HostName against names that contain non-US-ASCII characters, it MUST
   perform the conversion operation described in Section 4 of [IDNA],
   treating the HostName as a "query string" (i.e., the AllowUnassigned
   flag MUST be set).  Note that IDNA allows labels to be separated by
   any of the Unicode characters U+002E, U+3002, U+FF0E, and U+FF61;
   therefore, servers MUST accept any of these characters as a label
   separator.  If the server only needs to match the HostName against
   names containing exclusively ASCII characters, it MUST compare ASCII
   names case-insensitively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Literal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not permitted in "HostName".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that clients include an extension of type
   "server_name" in the client hello whenever they locate a server by a
   supported name type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server that receives a client hello containing the "server_name"
   extension MAY use the information contained in the extension to guide
   its selection of an appropriate certificate to return to the client,
   and/or other aspects of security policy.  In this event, the server
   SHALL include an extension of type "server_name" in the (extended)
   server hello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL be
   empty.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the server understood the client hello extension but does not
   recognize the server name, it SHOULD send an "unrecognized_name"
   alert (which MAY be fatal).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an application negotiates a server name using an application
   protocol and then upgrades to TLS, and if a server_name extension is
   sent, then the extension SHOULD contain the same name that was
   negotiated in the application protocol.  If the server_name is
   established in the TLS session handshake, the client SHOULD NOT
   attempt to request a different server name at the application layer.
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Maximum Fragment Length Negotiation</h3></a>

   Without this extension, TLS specifies a fixed maximum plaintext
   fragment length of 2^14 bytes.  It may be desirable for constrained
   clients to negotiate a smaller maximum fragment length due to memory
   limitations or bandwidth limitations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to negotiate smaller maximum fragment lengths, clients MAY
   include an extension of type "max_fragment_length" in the (extended)
   client hello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL
   contain:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   enum{

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   whose value is the desired maximum fragment length.  The allowed
   values for this field are: 2^9, 2^10, 2^11, and 2^12.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers that receive an extended client hello containing a
   "max_fragment_length" extension MAY accept the requested maximum
   fragment length by including an extension of type
   "max_fragment_length" in the (extended) server hello.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain a
   "MaxFragmentLength" whose value is the same as the requested maximum
   fragment length.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a server receives a maximum fragment length negotiation request
   for a value other than the allowed values, it MUST abort the
   handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.  Similarly, if a client
   receives a maximum fragment length negotiation response that differs
   from the length it requested, it MUST also abort the handshake with
   an "illegal_parameter" alert.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once a maximum fragment length other than 2^14 has been successfully
   negotiated, the client and server MUST immediately begin fragmenting
   messages (including handshake messages), to ensure that no fragment
   larger than the negotiated length is sent.  Note that TLS already
   requires clients and servers to support fragmentation of handshake
   messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The negotiated length applies for the duration of the session
   including session resumptions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The negotiated length limits the input that the record layer may
   process without fragmentation (that is, the maximum value of
   TLSPlaintext.length; see [TLS], Section 6.2.1).  Note that the output
   of the record layer may be larger.  For example, if the negotiated
   length is 2^9=512, then for currently defined cipher suites (those
   defined in [TLS], [KERB], and [AESSUITES]), and when null compression
   is used, the record layer output can be at most 793 bytes: 5 bytes of
   headers, 512 bytes of application data, 256 bytes of padding, and 20
   bytes of MAC.  This means that in this event a TLS record layer peer
   receiving a TLS record layer message larger than 793 bytes may
   discard the message and send a "record_overflow" alert, without
   decrypting the message.

   Without this extension, TLS specifies that when client authentication
   is performed, client certificates are sent by clients to servers
   during the TLS handshake.  It may be desirable for constrained
   clients to send certificate URLs in place of certificates, so that
   they do not need to store their certificates and can therefore save
   memory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to negotiate sending certificate URLs to a server, clients
   MAY include an extension of type "client_certificate_url" in the
   (extended) client hello.  The "extension_data" field of this
   extension SHALL be empty.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (Note that it is necessary to negotiate use of client certificate
   URLs in order to avoid "breaking" existing TLS servers.)

   Servers that receive an extended client hello containing a
   "client_certificate_url" extension MAY indicate that they are willing
   to accept certificate URLs by including an extension of type
   "client_certificate_url" in the (extended) server hello.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL be empty.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After negotiation of the use of client certificate URLs has been
   successfully completed (by exchanging hellos including
   "client_certificate_url" extensions), clients MAY send a
   "CertificateURL" message in place of a "Certificate" message:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  If CertificateURL.type is "individual_certs", each URL refers to a
      single DER-encoded X.509v3 certificate, with the URL for the
      client's certificate first.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  If CertificateURL.type is "pkipath", the list contains a single
      URL referring to a DER-encoded certificate chain, using the type
      PkiPath described in Section 8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When any other certificate format is used, the specification that
   describes use of that format in TLS should define the encoding format
   of certificates or certificate chains, and any constraint on their
   ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The hash corresponding to each URL at the client's discretion either
   is not present or is the SHA-1 hash of the certificate or certificate
   chain (in the case of X.509 certificates, the DER-encoded certificate
   or the DER-encoded PkiPath).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that when a list of URLs for X.509 certificates is used, the
   ordering of URLs is the same as that used in the TLS Certificate
   message (see [TLS], Section 7.4.2), but opposite to the order in
   which certificates are encoded in PkiPath.  In either case, the
   self-signed root certificate MAY be omitted from the chain, under the
   assumption that the server must already possess it in order to
   validate it.
   Servers receiving "CertificateURL" SHALL attempt to retrieve the
   client's certificate chain from the URLs and then process the
   certificate chain as usual.  A cached copy of the content of any URL
   in the chain MAY be used, provided that a SHA-1 hash is present for
   that URL and it matches the hash of the cached copy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers that support this extension MUST support the http: URL scheme
   for certificate URLs, and MAY support other schemes.  Use of other
   schemes than "http", "https", or "ftp" may create unexpected
   problems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the protocol used is HTTP, then the HTTP server can be configured
   to use the Cache-Control and Expires directives described in [HTTP]
   to specify whether and for how long certificates or certificate
   chains should be cached.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The TLS server is not required to follow HTTP redirects when
   retrieving the certificates or certificate chain.  The URLs used in
   this extension SHOULD therefore be chosen not to depend on such
   redirects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the protocol used to retrieve certificates or certificate chains
   returns a MIME-formatted response (as HTTP does), then the following
   MIME Content-Types SHALL be used: when a single X.509v3 certificate
   is returned, the Content-Type is "application/pkix-cert" [PKIOP], and
   when a chain of X.509v3 certificates is returned, the Content-Type is
   "application/pkix-pkipath" (see Section 8).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a SHA-1 hash is present for an URL, then the server MUST check
   that the SHA-1 hash of the contents of the object retrieved from that
   URL (after decoding any MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding) matches the
   given hash.  If any retrieved object does not have the correct SHA-1
   hash, the server MUST abort the handshake with a
   "bad_certificate_hash_value" alert.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that clients may choose to send either "Certificate" or
   "CertificateURL" after successfully negotiating the option to send
   certificate URLs.  The option to send a certificate is included to

   Currently defined TLS cipher suites use the MAC construction HMAC

   used as the MAC tag.  However, it may be desirable in constrained

   function to 80 bits when forming MAC tags.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to negotiate the use of 80-bit truncated HMAC, clients MAY

   Constrained clients may wish to use a certificate-status protocol

   In the OCSPStatusRequest, the "ResponderIDs" provides a list of OCSP

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both "ResponderID" and "Extensions" are DER-encoded ASN.1 types as
   defined in [OCSP].  "Extensions" is imported from [PKIX].  A zero-

   the "Extensions" type).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the case of the "id-pkix-ocsp-nonce" OCSP extension, [OCSP] is
   unclear about its encoding; for clarification, the nonce MUST be a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Procedure for Defining New Extensions</h2></a>

   The list of extension types, as defined in Section 2.3, is maintained
   by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  Thus, an
   application needs to be made to the IANA in order to obtain a new
   extension type value.  Since there are subtle (and not-so-subtle)
   interactions that may occur in this protocol between new features and
   existing features that may result in a significant reduction in
   overall security, new values SHALL be defined only through the IETF
   Consensus process specified in [IANA].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (This means that new assignments can be made only via RFCs approved
   by the IESG.)
   The following considerations should be taken into account when
   designing new extensions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  All of the extensions defined in this document follow the
      convention that for each extension that a client requests and that
      the server understands, the server replies with an extension of
      the same type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Some cases where a server does not agree to an extension are error
      conditions, and some simply a refusal to support a particular
      feature.  In general, error alerts should be used for the former,
      and a field in the server extension response for the latter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Extensions should as far as possible be designed to prevent any
      attack that forces use (or non-use) of a particular feature by
      manipulation of handshake messages.  This principle should be
      followed regardless of whether the feature is believed to cause a
      security problem.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Often the fact that the extension fields are included in the
      inputs to the Finished message hashes will be sufficient, but
      extreme care is needed when the extension changes the meaning of
      messages sent in the handshake phase.  Designers and implementors
      should be aware of the fact that until the handshake has been
      authenticated, active attackers can modify messages and insert,
      remove, or replace extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  It would be technically possible to use extensions to change major
      aspects of the design of TLS; for example, the design of cipher
      suite negotiation.  This is not recommended; it would be more
      appropriate to define a new version of TLS, particularly since the
      TLS handshake algorithms have specific protection against version
      rollback attacks based on the version number.  The possibility of
      version rollback should be a significant consideration in any
      major design change.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security considerations for the extension mechanism in general and
   for the design of new extensions are described in the previous
   section.  A security analysis of each of the extensions defined in
   this document is given below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In general, implementers should continue to monitor the state of the
   art and address any weaknesses identified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional security considerations are described in the TLS 1.0 RFC
   [TLS] and the TLS 1.1 RFC [TLSbis].
	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Security of server_name</h3></a>

   If a single server hosts several domains, then clearly it is
   necessary for the owners of each domain to ensure that this satisfies
   their security needs.  Apart from this, server_name does not appear
   to introduce significant security issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations MUST ensure that a buffer overflow does not occur,
   whatever the values of the length fields in server_name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although this document specifies an encoding for internationalized
   hostnames in the server_name extension, it does not address any
   security issues associated with the use of internationalized
   hostnames in TLS (in particular, the consequences of "spoofed" names
   that are indistinguishable from another name when displayed or
   printed).  It is recommended that server certificates not be issued
   for internationalized hostnames unless procedures are in place to
   mitigate the risk of spoofed hostnames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Security of max_fragment_length</h3></a>

   The maximum fragment length takes effect immediately, including for
   handshake messages.  However, that does not introduce any security
   complications that are not already present in TLS, since TLS requires
   implementations to be able to handle fragmented handshake messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that as described in Section 3.2, once a non-null cipher suite
   has been activated, the effective maximum fragment length depends on
   the cipher suite and compression method, as well as on the negotiated
   max_fragment_length.  This must be taken into account when sizing
   buffers, and checking for buffer overflow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Security of client_certificate_url</h3></a>

   There are two major issues with this extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first major issue is whether or not clients should include
   certificate hashes when they send certificate URLs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When client authentication is used *without* the
   client_certificate_url extension, the client certificate chain is
   covered by the Finished message hashes.  The purpose of including
   hashes and checking them against the retrieved certificate chain is
   to ensure that the same property holds when this extension is used,
   i.e., that all of the information in the certificate chain retrieved
   by the server is as the client intended.
   On the other hand, omitting certificate hashes enables functionality
   that is desirable in some circumstances; for example, clients can be
   issued daily certificates that are stored at a fixed URL and need not
   be provided to the client.  Clients that choose to omit certificate
   hashes should be aware of the possibility of an attack in which the
   attacker obtains a valid certificate on the client's key that is
   different from the certificate the client intended to provide.
   Although TLS uses both MD5 and SHA-1 hashes in several other places,
   this was not believed to be necessary here.  The property required of
   SHA-1 is second pre-image resistance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second major issue is that support for client_certificate_url
   involves the server's acting as a client in another URL protocol.
   The server therefore becomes subject to many of the same security
   concerns that clients of the URL scheme are subject to, with the
   added concern that the client can attempt to prompt the server to
   connect to some (possibly weird-looking) URL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In general, this issue means that an attacker might use the server to
   indirectly attack another host that is vulnerable to some security
   flaw.  It also introduces the possibility of denial of service
   attacks in which an attacker makes many connections to the server,
   each of which results in the server's attempting a connection to the
   target of the attack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the server may be behind a firewall or otherwise able to
   access hosts that would not be directly accessible from the public
   Internet.  This could exacerbate the potential security and denial of
   service problems described above, as well as allow the existence of
   internal hosts to be confirmed when they would otherwise be hidden.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The detailed security concerns involved will depend on the URL
   schemes supported by the server.  In the case of HTTP, the concerns
   are similar to those that apply to a publicly accessible HTTP proxy
   server.  In the case of HTTPS, loops and deadlocks may be created,
   and this should be addressed.  In the case of FTP, attacks arise that
   are similar to FTP bounce attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As a result of this issue, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   client_certificate_url extension should have to be specifically
   enabled by a server administrator, rather than be enabled by default.
   It is also RECOMMENDED that URI protocols be enabled by the
   administrator individually, and only a minimal set of protocols be
   enabled.  Unusual protocols that offer limited security or whose
   security is not well-understood SHOULD be avoided.
   As discussed in [URI], URLs that specify ports other than the default
   may cause problems, as may very long URLs (which are more likely to
   be useful in exploiting buffer overflow bugs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also note that HTTP caching proxies are common on the Internet, and
   some proxies do not check for the latest version of an object
   correctly.  If a request using HTTP (or another caching protocol)
   goes through a misconfigured or otherwise broken proxy, the proxy may
   return an out-of-date response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.4"><h3>6.4   Security of trusted_ca_keys</h3></a>

   It is possible that which CA root keys a client possesses could be
   regarded as confidential information.  As a result, the CA root key
   indication extension should be used with care.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of the SHA-1 certificate hash alternative ensures that each
   certificate is specified unambiguously.  As for the previous
   extension, it was not believed necessary to use both MD5 and SHA-1
   hashes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5"><h3>6.5   Security of truncated_hmac</h3></a>

   It is possible that truncated MACs are weaker than "un-truncated"
   MACs.  However, no significant weaknesses are currently known or
   expected to exist for HMAC with MD5 or SHA-1, truncated to 80 bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the output length of a MAC need not be as long as the
   length of a symmetric cipher key, since forging of MAC values cannot
   be done off-line: in TLS, a single failed MAC guess will cause the
   immediate termination of the TLS session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since the MAC algorithm only takes effect after all handshake
   messages that affect extension parameters have been authenticated by
   the hashes in the Finished messages, it is not possible for an active
   attacker to force negotiation of the truncated HMAC extension where
   it would not otherwise be used (to the extent that the handshake
   authentication is secure).  Therefore, in the event that any security
   problem were found with truncated HMAC in the future, if either the
   client or the server for a given session were updated to take the
   problem into account, it would be able to veto use of this extension.
	<a name="section-6.6"><h3>6.6   Security of status_request</h3></a>

   If a client requests an OCSP response, it must take into account that
   an attacker's server using a compromised key could (and probably
   would) pretend not to support the extension.  In this case, a client
   that requires OCSP validation of certificates SHOULD either contact
   the OCSP server directly or abort the handshake.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of the OCSP nonce request extension (id-pkix-ocsp-nonce) may
   improve security against attacks that attempt to replay OCSP
   responses; see Section 4.4.1 of [OCSP] for further details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Internationalization Considerations</h2></a>

   None of the extensions defined here directly use strings subject to
   localization.  Domain Name System (DNS) hostnames are encoded using
   UTF-8.  If future extensions use text strings, then
   internationalization should be considered in their design.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   Sections 2.3 and 5 describe a registry of ExtensionType values to be
   maintained by the IANA.  ExtensionType values are to be assigned via
   IETF Consensus as defined in RFC 2434 [IANA].  The initial registry
   corresponds to the definition of "ExtensionType" in Section 2.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MIME type "application/pkix-pkipath" has been registered by the
   IANA with the following template:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/pkix-pkipath

   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: pkix-pkipath
   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: version (default value is "1")

   Encoding considerations:
      This MIME type is a DER encoding of the ASN.1 type PkiPath,
      defined as follows:
        PkiPath ::= SEQUENCE OF Certificate
        PkiPath is used to represent a certification path.  Within the
        sequence, the order of certificates is such that the subject of
        the first certificate is the issuer of the second certificate,
        etc.
      This is identical to the definition published in [X509-4th-TC1];
      note that it is different from that in [X509-4th].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      All Certificates MUST conform to [PKIX].  (This should be
      interpreted as a requirement to encode only PKIX-conformant
      certificates using this type.  It does not necessarily require
      that all certificates that are not strictly PKIX-conformant must
      be rejected by relying parties, although the security consequences
      of accepting any such certificates should be considered
      carefully.)

      DER (as opposed to BER) encoding MUST be used.  If this type is
      sent over a 7-bit transport, base64 encoding SHOULD be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Security considerations:
      The security considerations of [X509-4th] and [PKIX] (or any
      updates to them) apply, as well as those of any protocol that uses
      this type (e.g., TLS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that this type only specifies a certificate chain that can be
      assessed for validity according to the relying party's existing
      configuration of trusted CAs; it is not intended to be used to
      specify any change to that configuration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interoperability considerations:
      No specific interoperability problems are known with this type,
      but for recommendations relating to X.509 certificates in general,
      see [PKIX].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Published specification: RFC 4366 (this memo), and [PKIX].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Applications which use this media type: TLS.  It may also be used by
      other protocols, or for general interchange of PKIX certificate
      chains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): DER-encoded ASN.1 can be easily recognized.
        Further parsing is required to distinguish it from other ASN.1
        types.
      File extension(s): .pkipath
      Macintosh File Type Code(s): not specified
