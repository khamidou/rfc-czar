</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   The IP Security Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) protocols use a sequence number to detect replay.  This
   document describes extensions to the Internet IP Security Domain of
   Interpretation (DOI) for the Internet Security Association and Key
   Management Protocol (ISAKMP).  These extensions support negotiation
   of the use of traditional 32-bit sequence numbers or extended (64-
   bit) sequence numbers (ESNs) for a particular AH or ESP security
   association.
	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The specifications for the IP Authentication Header (AH) [AH] and the
   IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [ESP] describe an option for
   use of extended (64-bit) sequence numbers.  This option permits
   transmission of very large volumes of data at high speeds over an
   IPsec Security Association, without rekeying to avoid sequence number
   space exhaustion.  This document describes the additions to the IPsec
   DOI for ISAKMP [DOI] that are needed to support negotiation of the
   extended sequence number (ESN) option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Bra97].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   IPsec Security Association Attribute</h2></a>

   The following SA attribute definition is used in Phase II of an
   Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) negotiation.  The attribute type
   is Basic (B).  Encoding of this attribute is defined in the base
   ISAKMP specification [ISAKMP].  Attributes described as basic MUST
   NOT be encoded as variable.  See [IKE] for further information on
   attribute encoding in the IPsec DOI.  All restrictions listed in
   [IKE] also apply to the IPsec DOI and to this addendum.

       Extended (64-bit) Sequence Number    11              B

   Class Values

       This class specifies that the Security Association will be using
       64-bit sequence numbers.  (See [AH] and [ESP] for a description
       of extended (64-bit) sequence numbers.)

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Attribute Negotiation</h2></a>

   If an implementation receives a defined IPsec DOI attribute (or
   attribute value) that it does not support, an ATTRIBUTES-NOT-SUPPORT
   SHOULD be sent and the security association setup MUST be aborted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an implementation receives any attribute value but the value for
   64-bit sequence numbers, the security association setup MUST be
   aborted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This memo pertains to the Internet Key Exchange protocol [IKE], which
   combines ISAKMP [ISAKMP] and Oakley [OAKLEY] to provide for the
   derivation of cryptographic keying material in a secure and
   authenticated manner.  Specific discussion of the various security
   protocols and transforms identified in this document can be found in
   the associated base documents and in the cipher references.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The addition of the ESN attribute does not change the underlying
   security characteristics of IKE.  In using ESNs with ESP, it is
   important to employ an encryption mode that is secure when very large
   volumes of data are encrypted under a single key.  Thus, for example,
   Data Encryption Standard (DES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
   would NOT be suitable for use with the ESN, because no more than 2^32
   blocks should be encrypted under a single DES key in that mode.
   Similarly, the integrity algorithm used with ESP or AH should be
   secure relative to the number of packets being protected.  To avoid
   potential security problems imposed by algorithm limitations, the SA
   lifetime may be set to limit the volume of data protected with a
   single key, prior to reaching the 2^64 packet limit imposed by the
   ESN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document contains a "magic" number to be maintained by the IANA.
   No additional class values will be assigned for this attribute.  The
   IANA has allocated an IPsec Security Attribute value for "Attribute
   Type".  This value is listed under the heading "value" in the table
   in Section 2.
