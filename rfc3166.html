</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   RFC 1403, "BGP OSPF Interaction", describes technology which is no
   longer used.  This document requests that RFC 1403 be moved to
   Historic status.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Details</h2></a>

   During a review of internet standards relating to BGP, it became
   apparent that BGP OSPF interaction, as described in RFC 1403, is not
   common usage (if at all), and requires significant implementation
   complexity.  Since this mechanism has not been in use in the public
   internet for many years (if ever), it is proposed to reclassify it to
   Historic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Moving RFC 1403 to Historic has no known effect on the security of
   the internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  References</h2></a>
