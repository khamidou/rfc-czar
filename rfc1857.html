	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Many network administrations commonly collect and archive network
   management metrics that indicate network utilization, growth and
   reliability.  The primary goals of this activity are to facilitate
   near-term problem isolation and longer-term network planning within
   the organization.  There is also the broader goal of cooperative
   problem isolation and network planning among network administrations.
   This broader goal is likely to become increasingly important as the
   Internet continues to grow, particularly as the number of Internet
   service providers expands and the quality of service between
   providers becomes more of a concern.
   There exist a variety of network management tools for the collection
   and presentation of network management metrics.  However, different
   kinds of measurement and presentation techniques make it difficult
   to compare data among networks.  In addition, there is not general
   agreement on what metrics should be regularly collected or how they
   should be displayed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There needs to be an agreed-upon model for

   1)   A minimal set of common network management metrics to satisfy
        the goals stated above,

   2)   Tools for collecting these metrics,

   3)   A common interchange format to facilitate the usage of these
        data by common presentation tools and

   4)   Common presentation formats.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Under this Operational Statistics model, collection tools will
   collect and store data to be retrieved later in a given format by
   presentation tools displaying the data in a predefined way.  (See
   figure below.)
The Operational Statistics Model

   (Collection of common metrics, by commonly available tools, stored in
   a common format, displayed in common formats by commonly available
   presentation tools.)

   This memo gives an overview of this model for common operational
   statistics. The model defines the gathering, storing and presentation
   of network operational statistics and classifies the types of
   information that should be available at each network operation center
   (NOC) conforming to this model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The model defines a minimal set of metrics and discusses how these
   metrics should be gathered and stored.  It gives recommendations for
   the content and layout of statistical reports which make possible the
   easy comparison of network statistics among NOCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The primary purpose of this model is to define mechanisms by which
   NOCs could share most effectively their operational statistics.  One
   intent of this model is to specify a baseline capability that NOCs
   conforming to the model may support with minimal development effort
   and minimal ongoing effort.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Model</h2></a>

   The model defines three areas of interest on which all underlying
   concepts are based:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1)   The definition of a minimal set of metrics to be gathered,

   2)   The definition of a format for storing collected statistical
        data and

   3)   The definition of methods and formats for generating reports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The model indicates that old tools currently in use could be
   retrofitted into the new paradigm. This could be done by providing
   conversion filters between old and new tools. In this sense this
   model intends to advocate the development of freely redistributable
   software for use by participating NOCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One basic idea of the model is that statistical data stored at one
   place could be retrieved and displayed at some other place.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Metrics and Polling Periods</h3></a>

   Here the value is 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The intent here is to define a minimal set of metrics that could be
   gathered easily using standard SNMP-based network management tools.
   Thus, these metrics should be available as variables in the Internet
   Standard MIB.
   If the Internet Standard MIB were changed, this minimal set of
   metrics should be reconsidered, as there are many metrics regarded
   as important, but not currently defined in the standard MIB.
   Some metrics which are highly desirable to collect are probably not
   retrievable using SNMP.  Therefore, tools and methods for gathering
   such metrics should be defined explicitly if such metrics are to be
   considered. This is, however, outside of the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Format for Storing Collected Data</h3></a>

   A format for storing data is defined. The intent is to minimize
   redundant information by using a single header structure wherein all
   information relevant to a certain set of statistical data is stored.
   This header section will give information about when and where the
   corresponding statistical data were collected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Reports</h3></a>

   Some basic classes of reports are suggested, addressing different
   views of network behavior.  Reports of total octets and packets over
   some time period are regarded as essential to give an overall view of
   the traffic flow in a network.  Differentiation between applications
   and protocols is regarded as needed to give ideas on which type of
   traffic is dominant.  Reports on resource utilization are
   recommended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The time period which a report spans may vary depending on its
   intent.  In engineering and operations daily or weekly reports may be
   sufficient, whereas for capacity planning there may be a need for
   longer-term reports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Security Issues</h3></a>

   There are legal, ethical and political concerns about data sharing.
   People, in particular Network Service Providers, are concerned about
   showing data that may make one of their networks look bad.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For this reason there is a need to insure integrity, conformity and
   confidentiality of the shared data. To be useful, the same data
   should be collected from all involved sites and it should be
   collected at the same interval.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Categorization of Metrics</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Overview</h3></a>

   This section gives a classification of metrics with regard to scope
   and ease of retrieval. A recommendation of a minimal set of metrics
   is given. This section also gives some hints on metrics to be
   considered for future inclusion when available in the network
   management environment. Finally some thoughts on storage requirements
   are presented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Categorization of Metrics Based on Measurement Areas</h3></a>

   The metrics used in evaluating network traffic could be classified
   into (at least) four major categories:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    o Utilization metrics
    o Performance metrics
    o Availability metrics
    o Stability metrics

	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   Utilization Metrics</h4></a>

   This category describes different aspects of the total traffic being
   forwarded through the network. Possible metrics include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    o Total input and output packets and octets
    o Various peak metrics
    o Per protocol and per application metrics

	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2   Performance Metrics</h4></a>

   These metrics relate to quality of service issues such as delays and
   congestion situations. Possible metrics include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    o RTT metrics on different protocol layers
    o Number of collisions on a bus network
    o Number of ICMP Source Quench messages
    o Number of packets dropped
	<a name="section-3.2.3"><h4>3.2.3   Availability Metrics</h4></a>

These metrics could be viewed as gauging long term accessibility on
different protocol layers. Possible metrics include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    o Line availability as percentage uptime
    o Route availability
    o Application availability

	<a name="section-3.2.4"><h4>3.2.4   Stability Metrics</h4></a>

   These metrics describe short-term fluctuations in the network which
   degrade the service level.  Changes in traffic patterns also could be
   recognized using these metrics.  Possible metrics include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    o Number of fast line status transitions
    o Number of fast route changes (also known as route flapping)
    o Number of routes per interface in the tables
    o Next hop count stability
    o Short term ICMP behavior

	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Categorization Based on Availability of Metrics</h3></a>

   To be able to retrieve metrics, the corresponding variables must be
   accessible at every network object which is part of the management
   domain for which statistics are being collected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some metrics are easily retrievable because they are defined as
   variables in the Internet Standard MIB.  Other metrics may be
   retrievable because they are part of some vendor's private enterprise
   MIB subtree.  Finally, some metrics are considered irretrievable,
   either because they are not possible to include in the SNMP concept
   or because their measurement would require extensive polling (loading
   the network with management traffic).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The metrics categorized below could each be judged as important in
   evaluating network behavior.  This list may serve as a basis for
   revisiting the decisions on which metrics are to be regarded as
   reasonable and desirable to collect. If the availability of the
   metrics listed below changes, these decisions may change.

   A large number of metrics could be considered for collection in the
   process of doing network statistics. To facilitate general consensus
   for this model, there is a need to define a minimal set of metrics
   that are both essential and retrievable in a majority of today's
   network objects.  General retrievability is equated with presence in
   the Internet Standard MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following metrics from the Internet Standard MIB were chosen as
   being desirable and reasonable:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For each interface:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           ifInOctets      (octets in)
           ifOutOctets     (octets out)
           ifInUcastPkts   (unicast packets in)
           ifOutUcastPkts  (unicast packets out)
           ifInNUcastPkts  (non-unicast packets in)

   For each node:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           ipForwDatagrams (IP forwards)
           ipInDiscards    (IP in discards)
           sysUpTime       (system uptime)

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Polling Frequencies</h2></a>

   The purpose of polling at specified intervals is to gather statistics
   to serve as a basis for trend and capacity planning. From the
   operational data it should be possible to derive engineering and
   management data. It should be noted that all polling and retention
   values given below are recommendations and are not mandatory.
	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Variables Needing High Resolution Polling</h3></a>

   To be able to detect peak behavior, it is recommended that a period
   of 1 minute (60 seconds) at a maximum be used in gathering traffic
   data. The metrics to be collected at this frequency are:

           ifInOctets      (octets in)

           ifOutUcastPkts  (unicast packets out)

   If it is not possible to gather data at this high polling frequency,

   To avoid storing redundant data in what might be a shared file
   system, it is desirable to preprocess the raw data. For example, if a

   is not changing. The use of the variables sysUpTime and ifOperStatus
   makes it possible not to have to continuously store data collected
   from links and nodes where no traffic has been transmitted for some

   This section describes a format for the storage of statistical data.
   The goal is to facilitate a common set of tools for the gathering,
   storage and analysis of statistical data. The format is defined with
   the intent of minimizing redundant information and thus minimizing
   storage requirements. If a client server based model for retrieving
   remote statistical data were later developed, the specified storage
   format could be used as the transmission protocol.
   This model is intended to define an interchange file format, which
   would not necessarily be used for actual data storage.  That means
   its goal is to provide complete, self-contained, portable files,
   rather than to describe a full database for storing them.

   may contain one and only one data section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A label section indicates the start and finish times for its

   Link utilization is used to capture information on network loading.
   The polling interval must be small enough to be significant with
   respect to variations in human activity, since this is the activity
   that drives variations in network loading. On the other hand, there
   is no need to make it smaller than an interval over which excessive
   delay would notably impact productivity. For this reason, 30 minutes
   is a good estimate of the time at which people remain in one activity
   and over which prolonged high delay will affect their productivity.
   To track 30 minute variations, there is a need to sample twice as
   frequently, i.e., every 15 minutes. Use of the polling period of 10
   minutes recommended above should be sufficient to capture variations
   in utilization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A possible format for reporting utilizations seen as peak behaviors
   is to use a method of combining averages and peak measurements onto

   If, for example, a diagram contains the daily totals for some period,
   then the peaks would be the most busy hour during each day. If the
   diagram were totals on an hourly basis then the peak would be the
   maximum ten-minute period in each hour.

   Window tool directly from the statistical server. Another
   complementary method would be to generate PostScript output to print
   the diagrams. In all cases it should be possible to store the
   retrieved data locally for later processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client/server approach is discussed further by Henry Clark in
   RFC 1856.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   Inclusion of Variables not in the Internet Standard MIB</h3></a>

   As has been pointed out above in the categorization of metrics, there
   are metrics which certainly could have been recommended if they were
   available in the Internet Standard MIB. To facilitate the inclusion
   of such metrics in the set of recommended metrics, it will be
   necessary to specify a subtree in the Internet Standard MIB
   containing variables judged necessary in the scope of performing
   operational statistics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.3"><h3>8.3   Detailed Resource Utilization Statistics</h3></a>

   One area of interest not covered in the above description of metrics
   and presentation formats is to present statistics on detailed views
   of the traffic flows. Such views could include statistics on a per
   application basis and on a per protocol basis. Today such metrics are
   not part of the Internet Standard MIB. Tools like the NSF NNStat are
   being used to gather information of this kind. A possible way to
   achieve such data could be to define an NNStat MIB or to include such
   variables in the above suggested operational statistics MIB subtree.
APPENDIX A

Some formulas for statistical aggregation

   The following naming conventions are used:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For poll values poll(n)_j

           n = Polling or aggregation period
           j = Entry number

   poll(900)_j is thus the 15 minute total value.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For peak values peak(n,m)_j

           n = Period over which the peak is calculated
           m = The peak period length
           j = Entry number

   peak(3600,900)_j is thus the maximum 15 minute period calculated over
   1 hour.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   Assume a polling over 24 hour period giving 1440 logged entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       =========================

       Without any aggregation we have

           poll(60)_1<br>
           ......
           poll(60)_1440<br>

       ========================

       15 minute aggregation will give 96 entries of total values

           poll(900)_1<br>
           ....
           poll(900)_96<br>


                         j=(n+14)
           poll(900)_k = SUM  poll(60)_j  n=1,16,31,...1426<br>
                         j=n              k=1,2,....,96


          There will also be 96 one-minute peak values.
                           j=(n+14)
          peak(900,60)_k = MAX poll(60)_j  n=1,16,31,....,1426<br>

   The next aggregation step is from 15 minutes to 1 hour.  This gives
   24 totals.

                             j=n                  k=1,2,....24

       ===================

   The next aggregation step is from 1 hour to 24 hours.  For each day

   There will probably be a difference between the three peak values in
   the final 24 hour aggregation. A smaller peak period will give higher
   values than a longer one, i.e., if adjusted to be numerically
   comparable.
