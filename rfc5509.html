	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Service Record (SRV) [RFC2782] identifies the host(s) that will
   support particular services.  The DNS is queried for SRV RR in the
   general form:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   _Service._Proto.Name

      Service: the symbolic name of the desired service

      Proto: the protocol of the desired service

      Name: the domain name for which this record is valid

   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" [RFC3861]
   provides guidance for locating the services associated with URIs that
   employ the following two URI schemes [RFC3986]: 'im' for INSTANT
   INBOXes [RFC3860] and 'pres' for PRESENTITIES [RFC3859].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to ensure that the association between "_im" and "_pres" and
   their respective underlying services are deterministic, the IANA has
   created two independent registries: the Instant Messaging SRV
   Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV Protocol Label registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines and registers the "_sip" protocol label in both
   registries so that computer programs can resolve 'im:' and 'pres:'
   URIs down to SIP addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Moreover, this document explains how the use of SIP for Presence and
   Instant Messaging uses SRV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   DNS SRV Usage of SIP with 'im' and 'pres' URIs</h2></a>

   Although there are standard procedures for resolving 'im' and 'pres'
   URIs (Section 3 of [RFC3861]), the labels for SIP are not registered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 5 of [RFC3428] states that if a user agent (UA) is presented
   with an IM URI (e.g., "im:fred@example.com") as the address for an
   instant message, it SHOULD resolve it to a SIP URI, and place the
   resulting URI in the Request-URI of the MESSAGE request before
   sending.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following the procedures defined in [RFC3861], in order to resolve
   the IM URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   _im._sip.example.com

   Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP service for instant
   messaging at simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
   _im._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com.  Thus, the instant
   messaging URI im:fred@example.com would resolve to a SIP URI of
   sip:fred@simple.example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SIP supports both pager [RFC3428] and session [RFC4975] IM mode.
   However, a DNS SRV lookup does not specify which SIP IM mode a domain
   offer.  If the user agent client (UAC) supports both session mode and
   pager mode, it is then suggested to try session mode first; if that
   mode is rejected, the UAC has to be ready to fall back to pager mode.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 5 of [RFC3856] states that procedures defined in [RFC3861]
   are also used to resolve the protocol-independent PRES URI for a
   presentity (e.g., "pres:fred@example.com") into a SIP URI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following the procedures defined in [RFC3861], in order to resolve
   the PRES URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   _pres._sip.example.com

   Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP presence service at
   simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
   _pres._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com.  Thus, the protocol-
   independent PRES URI pres:fred@example.com would resolve to a SIP URI
   of sip:fred@simple.example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document merely serves for the registration of DNS SRV labels in
   the appropriate IANA registry.  The document does not specify a
   protocol; therefore, there are no security issues associated with it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This specification registers a new SRV protocol label in both the
   Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV
   Protocol Label registry.
	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registration</h3></a>

   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" [RFC3861]
   defines an Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry for
   protocols that can provide services that conform to the "_im" SRV
   Service label.  Because SIP is one such protocol, IANA registers the
   "_sip" protocol label in the "Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label
   Registry", as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Protocol label:  _sip

   Specification:  RFC 5509

   Description:  Instant messaging protocol label for the use of SIP for
                 Presence and Instant Messaging protocol as defined by
                 [RFC3428].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Registrant Contact:  Salvatore Loreto <salvatore.loreto@ericsson.com>

	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Presence SRV Protocol Label Registration</h3></a>

   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" [RFC3861]
   defines a Presence SRV Protocol Label registry for protocols that can
   provide services that conform to the "_pres" SRV Service label.
   Because the use of SIP for Presence and Instant Messaging is one such
   protocol, the IANA registers the "_sip" protocol label in the
   "Presence SRV Protocol Label Registry", as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Protocol label:  _sip

   Specification:  RFC 5509

   Description:  Presence protocol label for the use of SIP for Presence
                 and Instant Messaging protocol as defined by [RFC3856].
