   This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
   Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema
   [PCLS] based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core
   Information Model (PCIM) Extensions [PCIM_EXT].  These changes and
   extensions consist of new LDAP object classes and attribute types
   [LDAP].  Some of the schema items defined in this document re-
   implement existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics
   introduced by [PCIM_EXT].  The other schema items implement new
   concepts, not covered by [PCLS].  This document updates RFC 3703
   [PCLS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to the concepts defined by [PCIM_EXT], this document
   introduces two new classes: pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and
   pcelsVendorValueAuxClass.  These classes provide a standard extension
   mechanism for vendor-specific policy variables and policy values that
   have not been specifically modeled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Within the context of this document, the term "PCELS" (Policy Core
   Extension LDAP Schema) is used to refer to the LDAP object class,
   attribute type definitions and the associated recommendations
   contained in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Specification of Requirements</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Relationship to Other Policy Framework Documents</h2></a>

   This document contains an LDAP schema mapping for the classes defined
   in the "Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions" [PCIM_EXT].
   The LDAP schema defined in this document is an extension to the
   "Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema"
   [PCLS], which defines the mapping of the "Policy Core Information
   Model -- Version 1 Specification" [PCIM] to an LDAP schema.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These three documents ([PCIM], [PCIM_EXT] and [PCLS]) are
   prerequisites for reading and understanding this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other documents may subsequently be produced with mappings of the
   same model to other storage or transport technologies.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Inheritance Hierarchy for PCELS</h2></a>

   The object class and attribute type names defined in this document
   are prefixed 'pcels'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The diagram below illustrates the combined class hierarchy for the
   LDAP object classes defined in the following documents:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - The class names prefixed 'pcels' are defined in this document.
   - The class names prefixed 'pcim' are defined in [PCLS].
   - The class names prefixed 'dlm1' are defined in [CIM_LDAP].
   - The class named 'top' is defined in [LDAP_SCHEMA].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All the new object classes except for pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and
   pcelsVendorValueAuxClass, are mapped from concepts defined or
   modified by [PCIM_EXT].  The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and
   pcelsVendorValueAuxClass classes are not mapped from [PCIM_EXT].
   They represent concepts introduced in this document.

    Extensions to LDAP

   The object classes described in this document contain certain
   optimizations for a directory that uses LDAP as its access protocol.
   An example is the use of auxiliary class attachment to LDAP entries
   for the realization of some of the associations defined in the
   information model.  For instance, the aggregation of a specific
   SimplePolicyCondition to a reusable PolicyRule [PCIM_EXT] may be
   realized by attaching a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass to a
   pcelsRuleInstance entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that other data stores might need to implement the associations
   differently.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Summary of Class Mappings</h3></a>

   The classes and their properties defined in the information model
   [PCIM_EXT] map directly to LDAP object classes and attribute types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The details of this mapping are discussed case by case in section 5.

     Figure 2.  Mapping of Information Model Extension Classes to LDAP

   The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and pcelsVendorValueAuxClass classes
   are not mapped from [PCIM_EXT].  These classes are introduced in this
   document as a new extension mechanism for vendor-specific policy
   variables and values that have not been specifically modeled.  Just
   like for any other schema elements defined in this document or in
   [PCLS], a particular submodel schema generally will not need to use
   vendor specific variable and value classes.   Submodel schemas SHOULD
   apply the recommendations of section 5.10 of [PCIM_EXT] with regards
   to the supported and unsupported elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Summary of Association Mappings</h3></a>

   The associations in the information model map to one or more of the
   following options:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1.  Attributes that reference DNs (Distinguished Names)
      2.  Directory Information Tree (DIT) containment
          (i.e., superior-subordinate relationships) in LDAP
      3.  Auxiliary class attachment
      4.  Association object classes and attributes that reference DNs

   The details of this mapping are discussed case by case in section 5.

 Figure 3.  Mapping of Information Model Extension Associations to LDAP
   Two [PCIM_EXT] associations are mapped to DIT containment:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - PolicyRoleCollectionInSystem is a weak association and weak
        associations map well to DIT containment [CIM_LDAP] (without
        being limited to this mapping).  In the absence of additional
        constraints, DIT containment is chosen here as the optimal
        association mapping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - ReusablePolicy is mapped to DIT containment for scalability
        reasons.  It is expected that applications will associate a
        large number of policy instances to a ReusablePolicyContainer
        and DIT containment is a type of association that scales well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Summary of Changes since PCLS</h3></a>

   This section provides an overview of the changes relative to [PCLS]
   defined in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The concept of a set of policies is introduced by two new object
       classes: pcelsPolicySet and pcelsPolicySetAssociation.  These
       classes enable the aggregation and relative prioritization of
       policies (rules and/or groups).  The attribute pcelsPriority is
       used by pcelsPolicySetAssociation instances to indicate the
       priority of a policy relative to the other policies aggregated by
       the same set.  Applications may use this attribute to apply
       appropriate ordering to the aggregated policies.  This new policy
       aggregation mechanism provides an alternative to the aggregation
       mechanism defined by [PCLS] (that defines
       pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass and/or pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass
       for attaching components to a pcimGroup).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  The attribute pcimRoles defined by [PCLS] is used here by the
       pcelsPolicySet object class.  Thus, the role based policy
       selection mechanism is extended to all the subclasses of
       pcelsPolicySet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  A new attribute pcelsDecisionStrategy is added on the
       pcelsPolicySet class as a mapping from the decision mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  A new class pcelsGroup (with two subclasses), implements the
       modified semantics of the PolicyGroup in accordance with
       [PCIM_EXT].  This new class inherits from its superclass
       pcelsPolicySet the ability to aggregate (with relative priority)
       other policy rules or groups.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  A new class pcelsRule (with two subclasses), implements the
       modified semantics of the PolicyRule in accordance with
       [PCIM_EXT].  It does not include an absolute priority attribute,
       but instances of non-abstract subclasses of pcelsRule can be
       prioritized relative to each other within a System (behavior
       inherited from its superclass: pcelsPolicySet).  The pcelsRule
       class also inherits from pcelsPolicySet the ability to aggregate
       other policy rules or groups, and thus, the ability to construct
       nested rule structures of arbitrary complexity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   6.  A new attribute pcelsExecutionStrategy is added to the pcelsRule
       and pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass classes to allow the
       specification of the expected behavior in case of multiple
       actions aggregated by a rule or by a compound action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   7.  Compound Conditions: The pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass class is
       added in order to map the CompoundPolicyCondition class.  A new
       class, pcelsConditionAssociation is used to aggregate policy
       conditions in a pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass.  The same class
       is also used to aggregate policy conditions in a pcelsRule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   8.  Compound Actions: The pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass class is added
       in order to map the CompoundPolicyAction class.  A new class,
       pcelsActionAssociation is used to aggregate policy actions in a
       pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass.  The same class is also used to
       aggregate policy actions in a pcelsRule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   9.  Simple Conditions, Simple Actions, Variables and Values: The
       simple condition, simple action, variable and value classes
       defined by [PCIM_EXT] are directly mapped to LDAP object classes.
       These are:  pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass,
       pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass, pcelsVariable and its subclasses, and
       pcelsValueAuxClass and its subclasses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   10.  A general extension mechanism is introduced for representing
        policy variables and values that have not been specifically
        modeled.  The mechanism is intended for vendor-specific
        extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   11.  Reusable Policy Repository: A new class (with two subclasses),
        pcelsReusableContainer is created as a subclass of
        pcimRepository.  While maintaining compatibility with older
        [PCLS] implementations, the addition of this class acknowledges
        the intent of [PCIM_EXT] to avoid the potential for confusion
        with the Policy Framework component named Policy Repository.
        The new class enables many-to-many associations between reusable
        policy containers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   12.  The ReusablePolicy association defined in [PCIM_EXT] is realized
        through subordination to an instance of a non-abstract subclass
        of pcelsReusableContainer.  Thus, reusable policy components
        (groups, rules, conditions, actions, variables and values) may
        be defined as stand-alone entries or stand-alone groups of
        related entries subordinated (DIT contained) to a
        pcelsReusableContainer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   13.  Device level filter classes are added to the schema.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   14.  The pcelsRoleCollection class is added to the schema to allow
        the association of policy roles to resources represented as LDAP
        entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Relationship to PCLS Classes</h3></a>

   Several [PCLS] classes are used in this document to derive other
   classes.  If a PCELS application requires a functionality provided by
   any of derived classes, then the [PCLS] class MUST also be supported
   by PCELS implementations.  These classes are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    pcimPolicy
    pcimRuleConditionAssociation
    pcimRuleActionAssociation
    pcimConditionAuxClass
    pcimActionAuxClass
    pcimRepository

   Other [PCLS] classes are neither derived to nor superseded by classes
   defined in this document.  If a PCELS application requires a
   functionality provided by any of these classes, then the [PCLS] class
   SHOULD be used.  These classes are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    pcimRuleValidityAssociation
    pcimTPCAuxClass
    pcimConditionVendorAuxClass
    pcimActionVendorAuxClass
    pcimPolicyInstance
    pcimElementAuxClass
    pcimSubtreesPtrAuxClass

   Among the classes defined in this document some implement concepts
   that supersede the concepts implemented by similar [PCLS] classes.
   PCELS implementations MAY support such [PCLS] classes.  These classes
   are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    pcimGroup and its subclasses
    pcimRule and its subclasses
    pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass
    pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass
    the subclasses of pcimRepository
	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Impact on Existing Implementations of the Policy Core LDAP Schema</h3></a>

    In general, the intent of PCELS is to extend the functionality
    offered by the Policy Core LDAP Schema.  For the most part, the
    compatibility with [PCLS] is preserved.  The few cases in which
    compatibility cannot be achieved due to fundamental changes imposed
    by [PCIM_EXT], are defined here as alternatives to the original
    implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    PCELS does not obsolete nor deprecate the concepts implemented by
    [PCLS].  The new LDAP schema items are defined in this document in a
    way that avoids, to the extent possible, interference with the
    normal operation of a reasonably well-executed implementation of
    [PCLS].  The intent is to permit at least a harmless coexistence of
    the two models in the same data repository.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    However, it should be noted that the PCELS introduces the following
    changes that may have an impact on some [PCLS] implementations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Some attributes originally used only by pcimRule or pcimGroup are
       now also used by classes unknown to [PCLS] implementations
       (pcelsPolicySet, pcelsRule and pcelsGroup).  In particular, the
       attribute pcimRoles is also used by pcelsPolicySet for role based
       policy selection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  Condition and action association classes originally used by only
       pcimRule are now used (through subclasses) by pcelsRule as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  pcimRepository containers may include entries of types unknown to
       [PCLS] implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the choice exists, PCELS implementations SHOULD support the new
   schema and MAY also support the one defined by [PCLS].  For example,
   if PolicyRule support is required, an implementation SHOULD be able
   to read or read-write (as applicable) pcelsRule entries.  The same
   implementation MAY be able to read or read-write pcimRule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   The Association of PolicyVariable and PolicyValues</h3></a>
      to PolicySimpleCondition and PolicySimpleAction

   A PolicySimpleCondition, as well as a PolicySimpleAction, includes a
   single PolicyValue and a single PolicyVariable.  Each of them can be
   attached or referenced by a DN.
   The attachment helps create compact PolicyCondition and PolicyAction
   definitions that can be efficiently provisioned and retrieved from

   In [PCIM_EXT], the two aggregations PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup and
   PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup, are combined into a single aggregation
   PolicySetComponent.  This aggregation and the capability of
   association between a policy and the ReusablePolicyContainer offer
   new possibilities of reusability.  Furthermore, these aggregations
   introduce new semantics representing the execution of one PolicyRule
   within the scope of another PolicyRule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since PolicySet is defined in [PCIM_EXT], it is mapped in this
   document to a new class pcelsPolicySet in order to provide an
   abstraction for a set of policy rules or groups.  The aggregation
   class PolicySetComponent in [PCIM_EXT] is mapped to a multi-value
   attribute pcelsPolicySetList in the pcelsPolicySet class and the
   attribute pcelsPolicySetDN in the pcelsPolicySetAssociation.  These
   attributes refer to the nested rules and groups.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible to store a rule/group nested in another rule/group in

   [PCIM_EXT] defines two new classes that allow the designer to create

      Figure 9.  Reusable Compound Conditions with Reusable Components

   All the conditions/actions are reusable so they are stored in
   reusable containers.  The figure above illustrates two different
   reusable policy containers, but the number of containers in the
   system is decided based on administrative reasons.  The conditions,
   actions, etc. may be stored in the same or different containers with
   no impact on the policy definition semantics.

   The semantics for the policy information classes that are to be
   mapped directly from the information model to an LDAP representation
   are detailed in [PCIM_EXT].  Consequently, this document presents
   only a brief reference to those semantics.  The focus here is on the
   mapping from the information model (which is independent of
   repository type and access protocol) to a form that can be accessed
   using LDAP.  For various reasons including LDAP specific
   optimization, this mapping is not always 1:1.  Some new classes and
   attributes (that were not part of [PCIM] or [PCIM_EXT]) needed to be
   created in order to implement the LDAP mapping.  These new LDAP-only
   classes are fully defined in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following notes apply to this section in its entirety.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note 1: The formal language for specifying the classes, attributes,
   and DIT structure and content rules is that defined in [LDAP_SYNTAX].
   In the following definitions, the class and attribute definitions
   follow [LDAP_SYNTAX] but they are line-wrapped to enhance human
   readability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note 2: Even though not explicitly noted in the following class and
   attribute definitions, implementations may define DIT structure and
   content rules where applicable and supported by the underlying LDAP
   infrastructure.  In such cases, the DIT structure rule considerations
   discussed in section 5 of [PCLS] must be applied to PCELS
   implementations as well.  The reasons and details are presented in
   [X.501].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note 3: Wherever possible, an equality, a substrings and an ordering
   matching rule are defined for a particular attribute.  This provides
   additional implementation flexibility.  However, in some cases, the
   LDAP matching semantics may not cover all the application needs.  For
   instance, different values of pcelsIPv4AddrList may be semantically
   equivalent.  The equality matching rule, caseIgnoreMatch, associated
   to this attribute type is not suitable for detecting this
   equivalence.  Implementers should not rely solely on LDAP syntaxes
   and matching rules for being consistent with this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note 4: The following attribute definitions use only LDAP matching
   rules and syntax definitions from [LDAP_SYNTAX], [LDAP_SCHEMA] and
   [LDAP_MATCH].  The corresponding X.500 matching rules are defined in
   [X.520].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note 5: Some of the following attribute types MUST conform to
   additional constraints on various data types (e.g., the only valid
   values for pcelsDecisionStrategy are 1 and 2).  Just like the
   attribute semantics, the definition of the value structures, valid
   ranges, etc. is covered by [PCIM_EXT] for the corresponding
   properties while such constraints are only briefly mentioned in this
   document.  In all cases, if a constraint is violated, the entry
   SHOULD be treated as invalid and the policy rules or groups that
   refer to it SHOULD be treated as being disabled, meaning that the
   execution of such policy rules or groups SHOULD be stopped.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note 6: Some of the object classes defined in this section cannot or
   should not be directly instantiated because they are either defined
   as abstract or do not implement stand-alone semantics (e.g.,
   pcelsValueAuxClass).  Regarding instances of objects that inherit
   from such classes, the text refers to "instances of <class_name>"
   when in fact the strictly correct expression would be "instances of
   objects that belong to non-abstract subclasses of <class_name>".  The
   omission is intentional; it makes the text easier to read.

   The pcelsPolicySet class represents a set of policies with a common

   together with the pcelsPolicySetAssociation class defined in a
   subsequent section of this document provide sufficient information to
   allow applications to apply appropriate ordering to a set of

   it is derived from the pcimPolicy class [PCLS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The pcelsPolicySetList attribute of a pcelsPolicySet instance

   in a pcelsPolicySet instance or to return sets of matching
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries in a meaningful order.  Instead,
