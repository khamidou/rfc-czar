</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module that
   contains textual conventions (TCs) to represent commonly used
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) management
   information.  The intent is that these textual conventions will be
   imported and used in GMPLS-related MIB modules that would otherwise
   define their own representations.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document defines a MIB module that contains textual conventions
   (TCs) for Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.
   These textual conventions should be imported by MIB modules that
   manage GMPLS networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This MIB module supplements the MIB module in [RFC3811] that defines
   textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   management.  [RFC3811] may continue to be used without this MIB
   module in networks that support only MPLS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For an introduction to the concepts of GMPLS, see [RFC3945].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h2></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other GMPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has rooted MIB objects in this MIB module under the mplsStdMIB
   subtree by assigning an OID to gmplsTCStdMIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IANA has made the following assignments in the "NETWORK MANAGEMENT
   PARAMETERS" registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-
   numbers in table:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ...mib-2.transmission.mplsStdMIB (1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166)

      Decimal  Name              References
      -------  -----             ----------
      12       GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB  [RFC4801]

   In the future, GMPLS-related standards-track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB (sic) subtree.  IANA has been requested
   to manage that namespace in the SMI Numbers registry [RFC3811].  New
   assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in
   [RFC2434].
