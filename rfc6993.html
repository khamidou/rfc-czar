	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Some real-time communication endpoints support the combined use of
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] and the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120].  To improve
   interoperability among such "CUSAX" endpoints [CUSAX], it can be
   helpful to advertise each endpoint's SIP address over XMPP and each
   endpoint's XMPP address over SIP, thus providing hints about the
   communication capabilities of the endpoints.  The former feature is
   enabled by an XMPP extension protocol called Reachability Addresses
   [XEP-0152].  As to the latter feature, discussion in the SIP
   community led to the conclusion that it would be best to use the
   Call-Info header field [RFC3261] with a value of "impp" ("instant
   messaging and presence protocol") for the "purpose" header field
   parameter.  An example follows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Call-Info: <xmpp:juliet@example.com> ;purpose=impp

   Although CUSAX endpoints constitute the primary use case for the
   "impp" purpose, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] for an
   instant messaging and presence protocol other than XMPP could be
   included in the Call-Info header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Advertising an endpoint's XMPP address over SIP could inform
   malicious entities about an alternative attack vector.  Because the
   "purpose" header field parameter could be spoofed, the receiving
   endpoint ought to check the value against an authoritative source
   such as a user directory.  Clients can integrity protect and encrypt
   this header field using end-to-end mechanisms such as S/MIME or hop-
   by-hop mechanisms such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification provides a new way to correlate otherwise possibly
   unconnected identifiers.  Because such correlations can be privacy
   sensitive, user agents ought to provide a means for users to control
   whether or not these values are sent.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document defines and registers a new predefined value "impp" for
   the "purpose" header field parameter of the Call-Info header field.
   The IANA has completed this action by adding this RFC as a reference
   to the line for the header field "Call-Info" and parameter name
   "purpose" in the "Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values"
   section of the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters"
   registry as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Header Field: Call-Info
     Parameter Name: purpose
     Predefined Values: Yes
     Reference: [RFC3261][RFC5367][RFC6910][RFC6993]
