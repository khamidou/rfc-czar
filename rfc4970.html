   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to
   know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the
   routing domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities.  A new Router
   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is proposed for this
   purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new opaque
   LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new
   LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be
   advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or
   autonomous system (AS)).

   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFV3]
   routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other
   routers in the routing domain.  This can be useful for both the
   advertisement and discovery of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 capabilities.
   Throughout this document, OSPF will be used when the specification is
   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  Similarly, OSPFv2 or OSPFv3
   will be used when the text is protocol specific.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to advertise
   optional router capabilities.  In the case of OSPFv2, all the bits in
   this field have been allocated so new optional capabilities cannot be
   advertised.  This document proposes extensions to OSPF to advertise
   these optional capabilities via opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 and new LSAs in
   OSPFv3.  For existing OSPF capabilities, backward- compatibility
   issues dictate that this advertisement is used primarily for
   informational purposes.  For future OSPF features, this advertisement
   MAY be used as the sole mechanism for advertisement and discovery.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Notation</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA</h2></a>

   OSPF routers MAY optionally advertise their optional capabilities in
   a link-scoped, area-scoped, or AS-scoped LSA.  For existing OSPF
   capabilities, this advertisement will be used primarily for
   informational purposes.  Future OSPF features could use the RI LSA as
   the sole mechanism for advertisement and discovery.  The RI LSA will
   be originated initially when an OSPF router instance is created and
   whenever one of the advertised capabilities is configured or changed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   OSPFv2 Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA</h3></a>

   OSPFv2 routers will advertise a link scoped, area-scoped, or AS-

                   OSPFv2 Router Information Opaque LSA


   The format of the TLVs within the body of an RI LSA is the same as
   the format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF [TE].
   The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/Value
   (TLV) triplets.  The format of each TLV is:

                                TLV Format

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the length
   field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the total
   size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 32-bit
   aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field set
   to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the value
   portion of the TLV.  Unrecognized types are ignored.
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   OSPFv3 Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA</h3></a>

   The OSPFv3 Router Information LSA has a function code of 12 while the
   S1/S2 bits are dependent on the desired flooding scope for the LSA.
   The U bit will be set indicating that the OSPFv3 RI LSA should be
   flooded even if it is not understood.  The Link State ID (LSID) value
   for this LSA is 0.  This is unambiguous since an OSPFv3 router will
   only advertise a single RI LSA per flooding scope.

                       OSPFv3 Router Information LSA

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an RI LSA is as defined in
   Section 2.1

   When a new Router Information LSA TLV is defined, the specification
   MUST explicitly state whether the TLV is applicable to OSPFv2 only,
   OSPFv3 only, or both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   OSPF Router Informational Capabilities TLV</h3></a>

   The first defined TLV in the body of an RI LSA is the Router
   Informational Capabilities TLV.  A router advertising an RI LSA MAY
   include the Router Informational Capabilities TLV.  If included, it
   MUST be the first TLV in the LSA.  Additionally, the TLV MUST
   accurately reflect the OSPF router's capabilities in the scope
   advertised.  However, the informational capabilities advertised have
   no impact on the OSPF protocol's operation -- they are advertised
   purely for informational purposes.
   The format of the Router Informational Capabilities TLV is as
   follows:

   The flooding scope for a Router Information LSA is determined by the
   LSA type.  For OSPFv2, type 9 (link-scoped), type 10 (area-scoped),
   or a type 11 (AS-scoped) opaque LSA may be flooded.  For OSPFv3, the
   S1 and S2 bits in the LSA type determine the flooding scope.  If AS-
   wide flooding scope is chosen, the originating router should also
   advertise area-scoped LSA(s) into any attached Not-So-Stubby Area
   (NSSA) area(s).  An OSPF router MAY advertise different capabilities
   when both NSSA area scoped LSA(s) and an AS-scoped LSA are
   advertised.  This allows functional capabilities to be limited in
   scope.  For example, a router may be an area border router but only
   support traffic engineering (TE) in a subset of its attached areas.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The choice of flooding scope is made by the advertising router and is
   a matter of local policy.  The originating router MAY advertise
   multiple RI LSAs as long as the flooding scopes differ.  TLV flooding

   specified in the accompanying specifications for new Router
   Information LSA TLVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Router Information LSA Opaque Usage and Applicability</h2></a>

   The purpose of the Router Information (RI) LSA is to advertise
   information relating to the aggregate OSPF router.  Normally, this
   should be confined to TLVs with a single value or very few values.
   It is not meant to be a generic container to carry any and all
   information.  The intent is to both limit the size of the RI LSA to
   the point where an OSPF router will always be able to contain the
   TLVs in a single LSA and to keep the task of determining what has
   changed between LSA instances reasonably simple.  Hence, discretion
   and sound engineering judgment will need to be applied when deciding
   whether newly proposed TLV(s) in support of a new application are
   advertised in the RI LSA or warrant the creation of an application
   specific LSA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document describes both a generic mechanism for advertising
   router capabilities and a TLV for advertising informational
   capability bits.  The latter TLV is less critical than the topology
   information currently advertised by the base OSPF protocol.  The
   security considerations for the generic mechanism are dependent on
   the future application and, as such, should be described as
   additional capabilities are proposed for advertisement.  Security
   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in [OSPF] and
   [OSPFV3].
