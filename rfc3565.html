   This document specifies the conventions for using the Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption with the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Overview</h2></a>

   This document specifies the conventions for using Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES) content encryption algorithm with the Cryptographic
   Message Syntax [CMS] enveloped-data and encrypted-data content types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X.208-88], using the Basic
   Encoding Rules (BER) [X.209-88] and the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER) [X.509-88].
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   AES</h3></a>

   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [AES] was developed to replace
   DES [DES].  The AES Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
   Publication specifies a cryptographic algorithm for use by U.S.
   Government organizations.  However, the AES will also be widely used
   by organizations, institutions, and individuals outside of the U.S.
   Government.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two researchers who developed and submitted the Rijndael algorithm
   for consideration are both cryptographers from Belgium: Dr. Joan
   Daemen of Proton World International and Dr. Vincent Rijmen, a
   postdoctoral researcher in the Electrical Engineering Department of
   Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The National Institute of Standards and technology (NIST) selected
   the Rijndael algorithm for AES because it offers a combination of
   security, performance, efficiency, ease of implementation, and
   flexibility.  Specifically, Rijndael appears to be consistently a
   very good performer in both hardware and software across a wide range
   of computing environments regardless of its use in feedback or
   non-feedback modes.  Its key setup time is excellent, and its key
   agility is good.  The very low memory requirements of the Rijndael
   algorithm make it very well suited for restricted-space environments,
   in which it also demonstrates excellent performance.  The Rijndael
   algorithm operations are among the easiest to defend against power
   and timing attacks.  Additionally, it appears that some defense can
   be provided against such attacks without significantly impacting the
   algorithm's performance.  Finally, the algorithm's internal round
   structure appears to have good potential to benefit from
   instruction-level parallelism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Enveloped-data Conventions</h2></a>

   The CMS enveloped-data content type consists of encrypted content and
   wrapped content-encryption keys for one or more recipients.  The AES
   algorithm is used to encrypt the content.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Compliant software MUST meet the requirements for constructing an

   "Enveloped-data Content Type".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The AES content-encryption key MUST be randomly generated for each
   instance of an enveloped-data content type.  The content-encryption
   key (CEK) is used to encrypt the content.
   AES can be used with the enveloped-data content type using any of the
   following key management techniques defined in [CMS] Section 6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) Key Transport: The AES CEK is uniquely wrapped for each recipient
   using the recipient's public RSA key and other values.  Section 2.2
   provides additional details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) Key Agreement: The AES CEK is uniquely wrapped for each recipient
   using a pairwise symmetric key-encryption key (KEK) generated using
   an originator's randomly generated private key (ES-DH [DH]) or
   previously generated private key (SS-DH [DH]), the recipient's public
   DH key, and other values.  Section 2.3 provides additional details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3) Previously Distributed Symmetric KEK:  The AES CEK is wrapped
   using a previously distributed symmetric KEK (such as a Mail List
   Key).  The methods by which the symmetric KEK is generated and
   distributed are beyond the scope of this document.  Section 2.4
   provides additional details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4) Password Encryption:  The AES CEK is wrapped using a KEK derived
   from a password or other shared secret.  Section 2.5 provides
   additional details.

   a RSA public key.  The CEK is encrypted with the recipient's RSA
   public key.  The issuerAndSerialNumber alternative identifies the
   recipient's certificate by the issuer's distinguished name and the
   certificate serial number; the subjectKeyIdentifier identifies the
   recipient's certificate by the X.509 subjectKeyIdentifier extension
   value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The KeyTransRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm field specifies the
   key transport algorithm (i.e., RSAES-OAEP [RSA-OAEP]), and the

   values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may find it
   much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys,
   searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute
   force searching the whole key space.  The generation of quality
   random numbers is difficult.  RFC 1750 [RANDOM] offers important
   guidance in this area.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When wrapping a CEK with a KEK, the KEK MUST always be at least the
   same length as the CEK.  An attacker will generally work at the
   weakest point in an encryption system.  This would be the smaller of
   the two key sizes for a brute force attack.
