A Clarification on the Use of Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs)
                in the SIP Event Notification Framework

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   Experience since the publication of the most recent SIP Events
   framework (in July 2012) has shown that there is room for
   interpretation around the use of Globally Routable User Agent URIs in
   that specification.  This document clarifies the intended behavior.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document is intended to clarify a point of implementor confusion
   arising from lack of clarity in [RFC6665].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Clarification of GRUU Handling</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 4.5.1 of [RFC6665] contains the following normative
   requirement on implementations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Notifiers MUST implement the Globally Routable User Agent URI
      (GRUU) extension defined in [RFC5627], and MUST use a GRUU as
      their local target.  This allows subscribers to explicitly target
      desired devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second sentence of this paragraph attempted to set context for
   the normative statement: the reason GRUUs are required in this
   context is to allow you to send SUBSCRIBE or REFER requests to a
   specific user agent, with the target of the subscription request
   being something like an INVITE dialog on that device.  Consequently,
   the requirement to include a GRUU as a local target was intended to
   apply not just to the local target for SUBSCRIBE-created dialogs, but
   to *all* dialogs, even those created by INVITE.  This requirement has
   been interpreted in a variety of ways by implementors, so a
   clarification is in order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Discussion subsequent to the publication of [RFC6665] has highlighted
   obscure cases in which implementations might be notifiers in some
   contexts, but may not wish to act as notifiers in others.  Under
   these narrow circumstances, the restriction described above is not
   necessary for dialogs about which the notifier will never accept
   subscriptions (although the use of GRUUs in such a context causes no
   harm, either).
   This document updates [RFC6665] to clarify the actual requirements.
   The replacement text is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Notifiers MUST implement the Globally Routable User Agent URI
      (GRUU) extension defined in [RFC5627].  Notifiers MUST use a GRUU
      as their local target for all dialog-forming methods and all
      target-refresh methods, except for those dialogs for which they
      will reject all subscription requests (implicit or explicit).  For
      clarity: an implementation that uses a non-GRUU local contact
      under the exception described above MUST reject a request that
      might create a subscription to the associated dialog, regardless
      of whether such subscription would be created by a SUBSCRIBE or a
      REFER message.  The rejection code under such conditions SHOULD be
      403 (Forbidden) unless some other code is more appropriate to the
      circumstances.  The foregoing requirements to implement and use
      GRUUs specifically include dialogs created by the INVITE method.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This mechanism does not introduce any security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC6665].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document requests no actions of IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Normative References</h2></a>
