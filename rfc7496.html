             Additional Policies for the Partially Reliable
             Stream Control Transmission Protocol Extension

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document defines two additional policies for the Partially
   Reliable Stream Control Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) extension.
   These policies allow limitation of the number of retransmissions and
   prioritization of user messages for more efficient usage of the send
   buffer.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Partially Reliable SCTP (PR-SCTP) extension defined in [RFC3758]
   provides a generic method for senders to abandon user messages.  The
   decision to abandon a user message is sender side only, and the exact
   condition is called a "PR-SCTP policy" ([RFC3758] refers to them as
   "PR-SCTP Services").  [RFC3758] also defines one particular PR-SCTP
   policy, called "Timed Reliability".  This allows the sender to
   specify a timeout for a user message after which the SCTP stack
   abandons the user message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies the following two additional PR-SCTP
   policies:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Limited Retransmission Policy:  Allows limitation of the number of
      retransmissions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Priority Policy:  Allows removal of lower-priority messages if space
      for higher-priority messages is needed in the send buffer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Additional PR-SCTP Policies</h2></a>

   This section defines two new PR-SCTP policies, one in each
   subsection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Please note that it is REQUIRED to implement [RFC3758], if you want
   to implement these additional policies.  However, these additional
   policies are OPTIONAL when implementing [RFC3758].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Limited Retransmissions Policy</h3></a>

   Using the Limited Retransmission Policy allows the sender of a user
   message to specify an upper limit for the number of retransmissions
   for each DATA chunk of the given user messages.  The sender MUST
   abandon a user message if the number of retransmissions of any of the
   DATA chunks of the user message would exceed the provided limit.  The
   sender MUST perform all other actions required for processing the
   retransmission event, such as adapting the congestion window and the
   retransmission timeout.  Please note that the number of
   retransmissions includes both fast and timer-based retransmissions.
   The sender MAY limit the number of retransmissions to 0.  This will
   result in abandoning the message when it would get retransmitted for
   the first time.  The use of this setting provides a service similar
   to UDP, which also does not perform any retransmissions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Please note that using this policy does not affect the handling of
   the thresholds 'Association.Max.Retrans' and 'Path.Max.Retrans' as
   specified in Section 8 of [RFC4960].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The WebRTC protocol stack (see [DATA-CHAN]) is an example of where
   the Limited Retransmissions Policy is used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Priority Policy</h3></a>

   Using the Priority Policy allows the sender of a user message to
   specify a priority.  When storing a user message in the send buffer
   while there is not enough available space, the SCTP stack at the
   sender side MAY abandon other user message(s) of the same SCTP
   association (with the same or a different stream) with a priority
   lower than the provided one.  User messages sent reliably are
   considered to have a priority higher than all messages sent with the
   Priority Policy.  The algorithm for selecting the message(s) being
   abandoned is implementation specific.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After lower-priority messages have been abandoned, high-priority
   messages can be transferred without the send call blocking (if used
   in blocking mode) or the send call failing (if used in non-blocking
   mode).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol stack (see [RFC7011])
   is an example of where the Priority Policy can be used.  Template
   records would be sent with full reliability, while flow records
   related to billing, security, and other monitoring would be sent
   using the Priority Policy with varying priority.  The priority of
   security-related flow records would be set higher than the priority
   of monitoring-related flow records.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Socket API Considerations</h2></a>

   This section describes how the socket API defined in [RFC6458] is
   extended to support the newly defined PR-SCTP policies, to provide
   some statistical information, and to control the negotiation of the
   PR-SCTP extension during the SCTP association setup.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Please note that this section is informational only.
	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Data Types</h3></a>

   This section uses data types from [IEEE.1003-1G.1997]: uintN_t means
   an unsigned integer of exactly N bits (e.g., uint16_t).  This is the
   same as in [RFC6458].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Support for Added PR-SCTP Policies</h3></a>

   As defined in [RFC6458], the PR-SCTP policy is specified and
   configured by using the following sctp_prinfo structure:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   struct sctp_prinfo {
     uint16_t pr_policy;
     uint32_t pr_value;
   };

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the Limited Retransmission Policy described in Section 3.1 is
   used, pr_policy has the value SCTP_PR_SCTP_RTX and the number of
   retransmissions is given in pr_value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using the Priority Policy described in Section 3.2, pr_policy
   has the value SCTP_PR_SCTP_PRIO.  The priority is given in pr_value.
   The value of zero is the highest priority, and larger numbers in
   pr_value denote lower priorities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following table summarizes the possible parameter settings
   defined in [RFC6458] and this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><pre>     +-------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
     | pr_policy         | pr_value                  | Specification |

     | SCTP_PR_SCTP_NONE | Ignored                   | [RFC6458]     |
     | SCTP_PR_SCTP_TTL  | Lifetime in ms            | [RFC6458]     |
     | SCTP_PR_SCTP_RTX  | Number of retransmissions | Section 3.1   |
     | SCTP_PR_SCTP_PRIO | Priority                  | Section 3.2   |

	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Socket Option for Getting the Stream-Specific PR-SCTP Status</h3></a>
      (SCTP_PR_STREAM_STATUS)

   This socket option uses IPPROTO_SCTP as its level and
   SCTP_PR_STREAM_STATUS as its name.  It can only be used with
   getsockopt() but not with setsockopt().  The socket option value uses
   the following structure:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   struct sctp_prstatus {
     sctp_assoc_t sprstat_assoc_id;
     uint16_t sprstat_sid;
     uint16_t sprstat_policy;
     uint64_t sprstat_abandoned_unsent;
     uint64_t sprstat_abandoned_sent;
   };

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sprstat_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style
      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates
      for which association the user wants the information.  It is an
      error to use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL|FUTURE}_ASSOC in sprstat_assoc_id.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sprstat_sid:  This parameter indicates for which outgoing SCTP stream
      the user wants the information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sprstat_policy:  This parameter indicates for which PR-SCTP policy
      the user wants the information.  It is an error to use
      SCTP_PR_SCTP_NONE in sprstat_policy.  If SCTP_PR_SCTP_ALL is used,
      the counters provided are aggregated over all supported policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sprstat_abandoned_unsent:  The number of user messages that have been
      abandoned using the policy specified in sprstat_policy on the
      stream specified in sprstat_sid for the association specified by
      sprstat_assoc_id, before any part of the user message could be
      sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sprstat_abandoned_sent:  The number of user messages that have been
      abandoned using the policy specified in sprstat_policy on the
      stream specified in sprstat_sid for the association specified by
      sprstat_assoc_id, after a part of the user message has been sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are separate counters for unsent and sent user messages because
   the SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT supports a similar differentiation.
   Please note that an abandoned large user message requiring SCTP-level
   fragmentation is reported in the sprstat_abandoned_sent counter as
   soon as at least one fragment of it has been sent.  Therefore, each
   abandoned user message is counted in either sprstat_abandoned_unsent
   or sprstat_abandoned_sent.
   If more detailed information about abandoned user messages is
   required, the subscription to the SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT is
   recommended.  Please note that some implementations might choose not
   to support this option, since it increases the resources needed for
   an outgoing SCTP stream.  For the same reasons, some implementations
   might only support using SCTP_PR_SCTP_ALL in sprstat_policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sctp_opt_info() needs to be extended to support
   SCTP_PR_STREAM_STATUS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Socket Option for Getting the Association-Specific PR-SCTP Status</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document does not add any security considerations to those given
   in [RFC4960], [RFC3758], and [RFC6458].  As indicated in the Security
   Considerations of [RFC3758], transport-layer security in the form of
   TLS over SCTP (see [RFC3436]) can't be used for PR-SCTP.  However,
   DTLS over SCTP (see [RFC6083]) could be used instead.  If DTLS over
   SCTP as specified in [RFC6083] is used, the Security Considerations
   of [RFC6083] do apply.  It should also be noted that using PR-SCTP
   for an SCTP association doesn't allow that association to behave more
   aggressively than an SCTP association not using PR-SCTP.
