     Analysis of Solution Proposals for Hosts to Learn NAT64 Prefix

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   Hosts and applications may benefit from learning if an IPv6 address
   is synthesized and if NAT64 and DNS64 are present in a network.  This
   document analyzes all proposed solutions (known at the time of
   writing) for communicating whether the synthesis is taking place,
   what address format was used, and what IPv6 prefix was used by the
   NAT64 and DNS64.  These solutions enable both NAT64 avoidance and
   local IPv6 address synthesis.  The document concludes by recommending
   the standardization of the approach based on heuristic discovery.

   Hosts and applications may benefit from learning if an IPv6 address
   is synthesized, which would mean that a NAT64 is used to reach the
   IPv4 network or Internet.  There are two issues that can be addressed
   with solutions that allow hosts and applications to learn the
   Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) [RFC6052] used by the NAT64 [RFC6146]
   and the DNS64 [RFC6147] devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first issue is finding out whether a particular address is
   synthetic and therefore learning the presence of a NAT64.  For
   example, a dual-stack host with IPv4 connectivity could use this
   information to bypass NAT64 and use native IPv4 transport for
   destinations that are reachable through IPv4.  We will refer this as
   'Issue #1' throughout the document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second issue is finding out how to construct from an IPv4 address
   an IPv6 address that will be routable to/by the NAT64.  This is
   useful when IPv4 literals can be found in the payload of some
   protocol or applications do not use DNS to resolve names to addresses
   but know the IPv4 address of the destination by some other means.  We
   will refer this as 'Issue #2' throughout the document.
   Additionally, three other issues have to be considered by a solution
   addressing the first two issues: whether DNS is required ('Issue
   #3'), whether a solution supports changing NSP ('Issue #4'), and
   whether multiple NSPs are supported (either of the same or different
   length) for load-balancing purposes ('Issue #5').

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document analyzes all proposed solutions known at the time of
   writing for communicating if the synthesis is taking place, used
   address format, and the IPv6 prefix used by the NAT64 and DNS64.
   Based on the analysis we conclude whether the issue of learning the
   Network-Specific Prefix is worth solving and what would be the
   recommended solution(s) in that case.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   Address Synthesis

      Address synthesis is a mechanism, in the context of this document,
      where an IPv4 address is represented as an IPv6 address understood
      by a NAT64 device.  The synthesized IPv6 address is formed by
      embedding an IPv4 address as-is into an IPv6 address prefixed with
      an NSP/WKP.  It is assumed that the 'unused' suffix bits of the
      synthesized address are set to zero as described in Section 2.2 of
      [RFC6052].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DNS64

      DNS extensions for network address translation from IPv6 clients
      to IPv4 servers: A network entity that synthesizes IPv6 addresses
      and AAAA records out of IPv4 addresses and A records, hence making
      IPv4 namespaces visible in the IPv6 namespace.  DNS64 uses NSP
      and/or WKP in the synthesis process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NAT64

      Network Address and protocol Translation mechanism for translating
      IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice versa: A network entity that
      a host or an application may want to either avoid or utilize.
      IPv6 packets that hosts sent to addresses in the NSP and/or WKP
      are routed to NAT64.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NSP

      Network-Specific Prefix: A prefix chosen by a network
      administrator for NAT64/DNS64 to present IPv4 addresses in the
      IPv6 namespace.
   WKP

      Well-Known Prefix: A prefix (64:ff9b::/96) chosen by IETF and
      configured by a network administrator for NAT64/DNS64 to present
      IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 namespace.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Issues</h2></a>

   This document analyzes different solutions with a focus on the
   following five issues:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Issue #1

      The problem of distinguishing between synthesized and real IPv6
      addresses, which allows a host to learn the presence of a NAT64 in
      the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Issue #2

      The problem of learning the NSP used by the access network and
      needed for local IPv6 address synthesis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Issue #3

      The problem of learning the NSP or WKP used by the access network
      by a host not implementing DNS (hence, applications are unable to
      use DNS to learn the prefix).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Issue #4

      The problem of supporting changing NSP.  The NSP learned by the
      host may become stale for multiple reasons.  For example, the host
      might move to a new network that uses a different NSP, thus making
      the previously learned NSP stale.  Also, the NSP used in the
      network may be changed due administrative reasons, thus again
      making the previously learned NSP stale.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Issue #5

      The problem of supporting multiple NSPs.  A network may be
      configured with multiple NSPs for address synthesis.  For example,
      for load-balancing purposes, each NAT64 device in the same network
      could be assigned their own NSP.  It should be noted that learning
      a single NSP is enough for an end host to successfully perform
      local IPv6 address synthesis, but to avoid NAT64, the end host
      needs to learn all NSPs used by the access network.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Background</h2></a>

   Certain applications, operating in protocol translation scenarios,
   can benefit from knowing the IPv6 prefix used by a local NAT64 of the
   attached access network.  This applies to Scenario 1 ("IPv6 network
   to IPv4 Internet"), Scenario 5 ("An IPv6 network to an IPv4
   network"), and Scenario 7 ("The IPv6 Internet to the IPv4 Internet")
   in the IPv4/IPv6 translation framework document [RFC6144].  Scenario
   3 ("The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network") is not considered
   applicable herein as in that case, a NAT64 is located at the front of
   a remote IPv4 network, and a host in IPv6 Internet can benefit very
   little from learning the NSP IPv6 prefix used by the remote NAT64.
   The NAT64 prefix can be either a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) or the
   Well-Known Prefix (WKP).  Below is (an incomplete) list of various
   use cases where it is beneficial for a host or an application to know
   the presence of a NAT64 and the NSP/WKP:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Host-based DNSSEC validation.  As is documented in DNS64
      [RFC6147], Section 5.5, Point 3, synthetic AAAA records cannot be
      successfully validated in a host.  In order to utilize NAT64, a
      security-aware and validating host has to perform the DNS64
      function locally, and hence, it has to be able to learn WKP or
      proper NSP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Protocols that use IPv4 literals.  In IPv6-only access, native
      IPv4 connections cannot be created.  If a network has NAT64, it is
      possible to synthesize an IPv6 address by combining the IPv4
      literal and the IPv6 prefix used by NAT64.  The synthesized IPv6
      address can then be used to create an IPv6 connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Multicast translation [MCAST-TRANSLATOR] [V4V6MC-FRAMEWORK].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  URI schemes with host IPv4 address literals rather than domain
      names (e.g., http://192.0.2.1, ftp://192.0.2.1, imap://192.0.2.1,
      ipp://192.0.2.1).  A host can synthesize an IPv6 address out of
      the literal in the URI and use IPv6 to create a connection through
      NAT64.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Updating the host's [RFC6724] preference table to prefer native
      prefixes over translated prefixes.  This is useful as applications
      are more likely able to traverse through NAT44 than NAT64.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DNS64 cannot serve applications that are not using DNS or that obtain
   referral as an IPv4 literal address.  One example application is the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], as used by the Real
   Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [RFC2326] and the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  Other example applications include web
   browsers, as IPv4 address literals are still encountered in web pages
   and URLs.  Some of these applications could still work through NAT64,
   provided they were able to create locally valid IPv6 presentations of
   peers' IPv4 addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is a known issue that passing IP address referrals often fails in
   today's Internet [REFERRAL-PS].  Synthesizing IPv6 addresses does not
   necessarily make the situation any better as the synthesized
   addresses utilizing NSP are not distinguishable from public IPv6
   addresses for the referral receiver.  However, the situation is not
   really any different from the current Internet as using public
   addresses does not really guarantee reachability (for example, due to
   firewalls).  A node 'A' behind NAT64 may detect it is talking to a
   node 'B' through NAT64, in which case the node 'A' may want to avoid
   passing its IPv6 address as a referral to the node 'B'.  The node 'B'
   on the IPv4 side of the NAT64 should not see the IPv6 address of a
   node 'A' from the IPv6 side of NAT64, and hence the node 'B' should
   not be able to pass IPv6 address referral to a node 'C'.  Passing
   IPv4 presentation of the IPv6 address of the host 'A' to the node 'C'
   is bound to similar problems as passing a public IPv4 address of a
   host behind NAT44 as a referral.  This analysis focuses on detecting
   NAT64 presence from the IPv6 side of NAT64.

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   DNS Query for a Well-Known Name</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1   Solution Description</h4></a>

   Section 3 of [RFC7050] describes a host behavior for discovering the
   presence of a DNS64 server and a NAT64 device, and heuristics for
   discovering the used NSP.  A host requiring information for local
   IPv6 address synthesis or for NAT64 avoidance sends a DNS query for a
   AAAA record of a Well-Known IPv4-only Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN).  If a host receives a negative reply, it knows that no DNS64
   and NAT64 are in the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a host receives a AAAA reply, it knows the network must be
   utilizing IPv6 address synthesis.  After receiving a synthesized AAAA
   resource record, the host may examine the received IPv6 address and
   use heuristics, such as "subtracting" the known IPv4 address out of
   synthesized IPv6 address, to find out the NSP.

   The PROs of the proposal are listed below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  Can be used to solve Issues #1 and #2.
   +  Solves Issue #4 via the lifetime of the DNS record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  Can partially solve Issue #5 if multiple synthetic AAAA records

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  Does not necessarily require any standards effort.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  Does not require host stack or resolver changes.  All required

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  The solution is backward compatible from the point of view of
      'legacy' hosts and servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  Hosts or applications interested in learning about synthesis and
      the used NSP can do the "discovery" proactively at any time, for
      example, every time the host attaches to a new network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +  Does not require explicit support from the network using NAT64.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CONs of the proposal are listed below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Requires hosting of a DNS resource record for the Well-Known Name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Does not provide a solution for Issue #3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  This method is only able to find one NSP even if a network is
      utilizing multiple NSPs (Issue #5) (unless DNS64 includes multiple
      synthetic AAAA records in response).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.3"><h4>5.1.3   Summary</h4></a>

   This is the only approach that can be deployed without explicit
   support from the network or the host.  This approach could also
   complement explicit methods and be used as a fallback approach when
   explicit methods are not supported by an access network.

   [SYNTH-FLAG-2011] defined a new Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)
   option [RFC2671] that contained 3 flag bits (called SY-bits).  The
   EDNS0 option served as an implicit indication of the presence of a
   DNS64 server and NAT64 device.  The EDNS0 option SY-bit values other
   than '000' and '111' explicitly told the NSP prefix length.  Only the

   combination into the synthesized AAAA resource record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CONs of the proposal are listed below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Requires end hosts to support EDNS0 extension mechanisms
      [RFC6891].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Requires host resolver changes and mechanism/additions to the host

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Does not provide a solution for Issue #3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  EDNS0 flags and options are typically hop-by-hop only, severely

      survives through all DNS proxies and servers in between.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.3"><h4>5.2.3   Summary</h4></a>

   The solution based on the EDNS0 option works by extending the
   existing EDNS0 resource record.  Although the solution has host
   resolver and DNS64 server impacts, the changes are limited to those
   entities (end host, applications) that are interested in learning the
   presence of NAT64 and the used NAT64 prefix.  The provisioning and
   management overhead is minimal, if not non-existent, as the EDNS0
   options are synthesized in a DNS64 server in a same manner as the
   synthesized AAAA resource records.  Moreover, EDNS0 does not induce
   any load to DNS servers because no new RRType query is defined.

   [DNS-A64] proposed a new DNS resource record (A64) that would be a
   record dedicated to storing a single IPv4-embedded IPv6 address
   [RFC6052].  Use of a dedicated resource record would allow a host to
   distinguish between real IPv6 addresses and synthesized IPv6

   record.  A positive answer with an A64 record informs the requesting
   host that the resolved address is not a native address but an IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 address.  This would ease the local policies to prefer
   direct communications (i.e., avoid using IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses
   when a native IPv6 address or a native IPv4 address is available).
   Applications may be notified via new or modified API.

   Our conclusion is to recommend publishing the Well-Known DNS Name
   heuristic discovery-based method as a Standards Track IETF document
   for applications and host implementors to implement as-is.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As a general principle, we prefer to have as minimal a solution as
   possible, avoid impacts to entities not otherwise involved in the
   protocol translation scheme, minimize host impact, and require
   minimal to no operational effort on the network side.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Of the different issues, we give the most weight to Issues #1 and #2.
   We do not give much weight to Issue #3, as cases where hosts need to
   synthesize IPv6 addresses but do not have DNS available seem rare to
   us.  Even if an application does not otherwise utilize DNS, it ought
   to be able to trigger a simple DNS query to find out WKP/NSP.  Issue
   #4 is handled by the majority of solutions, and Issue #5 is
   considered to be mostly insignificant as even if individual hosts
   would use only one NSP at a time, different hosts would be using
   different NSPs, hence supporting load-balancing targets.  Only one of
   the discussed solutions, see Section 5.6, supports learning of
   possible new or indicating support for multiple algorithms for
   address synthesis other than the one described in [RFC6052].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The DNS64 entity has to be configured with WKP/NSP in order for it to
   do synthesis; hence, using DNS also for delivering the synthesis
   information sounds logical.  The fact that the synthesis information
   fate-shares the information received in the DNS response is a
   valuable attribute and reduces the possible distribution of stale
   prefix information.  However, having all DNS64 servers support
   explicit WKP/NSP discovery (ENDS0, A64, and DNS SRV record
   approaches) is difficult to arrange.  The U-NAPTR-based approach
   would require provisioning information into the ".ip6.arpa." tree,
   which would not be entirely internal for the provider.  Use of DHCPv6
   would involve additional trouble configuring DHCPv6 servers and
   ensuring DHCPv6 clients are in place; it would also involve ensuring
   that the NAT64 and DHCPv6 (and possibly even some DNS64 servers) are
   all in sync.  RA-based mechanisms are operationally expensive as
   configuration would have to be placed and maintained in the access
   routers.  Furthermore, both DHCPv6 and RA-based mechanisms involve
   entities that do not otherwise need to be aware of protocol
   translation (they only need to know DNS server addresses).  Finally,
   regarding the use of STUN, a host does not need to implement STUN
   whereas DNS is, in practice, required anyway.  Also, the STUN
   protocol would need to be changed on both the host and network side
   to support the discovery of NAT64 and WKP/NSP.

   synthesis may allow an attacker to insert itself as a middle man or
   to perform a denial-of-service attack.  The DHCPv6 and RA-based
   approaches are vulnerable to forgery as the attacker may send forged
   RAs or act as a rogue DHCPv6 server (unless DHCPv6 authentication
   [RFC3315] or Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] are used).
   If the attacker is already able to modify and forge DNS responses
   (flags, addresses of known IPv4-only servers, records, etc.), ability
   to influence local address synthesis is likely of low additional
   value.  Also, a DNS-based mechanism is only as secure as the method
   used to configure the DNS server's IP addresses on the host.
   Therefore, if, for example, the host cannot trust DHCPv6, it cannot
   trust the DNS server learned via DHCPv6 either, unless the host has a
   way to authenticate all DNS responses (e.g., via DNSSEC [RFC4033]).
