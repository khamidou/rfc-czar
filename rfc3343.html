	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   This memo describes a presence service that is built upon the APEX
   [1] "relaying mesh".  The APEX presence service is used to manage
   presence information for APEX endpoints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   APEX, at its core, provides a best-effort datagram service.  Within
   an administrative domain, all relays must be able to handle messages
   for any endpoint within that domain.  APEX services are logically
   defined as endpoints, but given their ubiquitous semantics they do
   not necessarily need to be associated with a single physical
   endpoint.  As such, they may be provisioned co-resident with each
   relay within an administrative domain, even though they are logically
   provided on top of the relaying mesh, i.e.,<pre>

      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
      |   APEX   |     |   APEX   |    |   APEX   |    |         |
      |  access  |     | presence |    |  report  |    |   ...   |
      | service  |     |  service |    | service  |    |         |
      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
           |                |               |               |
           |                |               |               |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                |
   |                            APEX core                           |
   |                                                                |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

   That is, applications communicate with an APEX service by exchanging
   data with a "well-known endpoint" (WKE).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   APEX applications communicate with the presence service by exchanging
   data with the well-known endpoint "apex=presence" in the
   corresponding administrative domain, e.g.,
   "apex=presence@example.com" is the endpoint associated with the
   presence service in the "example.com" administrative domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that within a single administrative domain, the presence service
   makes use of the APEX access [3] service in order to determine if an
   originator is allowed to view or manage presence information.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Use and Management of Presence Information</h2></a>

   Management of presence information falls into three categories:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  applications may update the presence information associated with
      an endpoint;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  applications may subscribe to receive presence information
      associated with an endpoint; and,

   o  applications may find out who is subscribed to receive presence
      information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each is now described in turn.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1  Update of Presence Information</h3></a>

   When an application wants to modify the presence information
   associated with an endpoint, it sends a publish operation to the
   service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <publish publisher='fred@example.com' transID='1'
                         timeStamp='2000-05-14T13:30:00-08:00'>
                    <presence publisher='fred@example.com'
                           lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00'
                           publisherInfo='http://www.example.com/fred/'>
                        <tuple
                          destination='apex:fred/appl=im@example.com'
                          availableUntil='2000-05-14T14:02:00-08:00' />
                        <tuple destination='mailto:fred@flintstone.com'
                          availableUntil='2525-12-31T23:59:59-08:00' />
                    </presence>
                </publish>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />
   Note that this example uses the "subaddress" convention specified in
   Section 2.2 of [1] (e.g., "fred/appl=im") to denote multiplexing of
   traffic for a particular endpoint.  Of course, popular applications
   may have their own URI method assigned to them (e.g.,
   "im:fred@example.com").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     S: <ok />

	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2  Distribution of Presence Information</h3></a>

   When an application wants to (periodically) receive the presence
   information associated with an endpoint, it sends a subscribe
   operation to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |

                <subscribe publisher='fred@example.com' duration='86400'
                           transID='100' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />
   The service immediately responds with a publish operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                           lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00'
                           publisherInfo='http://www.example.com/fred/'>

                </publish>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Subsequently, for up to the specified "duration", the service sends
   new publish operations whenever there are any changes to the
   endpoint's presence information.  If the "duration" is zero-valued, a
   one time poll of the presence information is achieved; otherwise, at
   the end of the "duration", a terminate operation is sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that Step 5 of Section 4.4 requires that the "lastUpdate"
   attribute of a presence entry be supplied in order to update that
   entry; accordingly, applications must successfully retrieve a
   presence entry prior to trying to update that entry.  This is usually
   accomplished by subscribing with a zero-valued duration.
   (Regardless, administrators should ensure that applications
   authorized to update a presence entry are also authorized to retrieve
   that entry.)
   Either the subscriber or the service may cancel a subscription by
   sending a terminate operation, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |

   sends a watch operation to the service, e.g.,

   Subsequently, for up to the specified "duration", the service sends

   one time poll of the watcher information is achieved; otherwise, at
   the end of the "duration", a terminate operation is sent.
   Either the watcher or the service may cancel the request by sending a
   terminate operation, e.g.,

   When an application wants to (periodically) receive the presence

   When an application no longer wishes to subscribe to presence
