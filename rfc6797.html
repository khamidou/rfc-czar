                 HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This specification defines a mechanism enabling web sites to declare
   themselves accessible only via secure connections and/or for users to
   be able to direct their user agent(s) to interact with given sites
   only over secure connections.  This overall policy is referred to as
   HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).  The policy is declared by web
   sites via the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header field
   and/or by other means, such as user agent configuration, for example.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   HTTP [RFC2616] may be used over various transports, typically the
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  However, TCP does not provide
   channel integrity protection, confidentiality, or secure host
   identification.  Thus, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol
   [RFC6101] and its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246]
   were developed in order to provide channel-oriented security and are
   typically layered between application protocols and TCP.  [RFC2818]
   specifies how HTTP is layered onto TLS and defines the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme of "https" (in practice, however,
   HTTP user agents (UAs) typically use either TLS or SSL3, depending
   upon a combination of negotiation with the server and user
   preferences).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   UAs employ various local security policies with respect to the
   characteristics of their interactions with web resources, depending
   on (in part) whether they are communicating with a given web
   resource's host using HTTP or HTTP-over-Secure-Transport.  For
   example, cookies ([RFC6265]) may be flagged as Secure.  UAs are to
   send such Secure cookies to their addressed host only over a secure
   transport.  This is in contrast to non-Secure cookies, which are
   returned to the host regardless of transport (although subject to
   other rules).
   UAs typically announce to their users any issues with secure
   connection establishment, such as being unable to validate a TLS
   server certificate trust chain, or if a TLS server certificate is
   expired, or if a TLS host's domain name appears incorrectly in the
   TLS server certificate (see Section 3.1 of [RFC2818]).  Often, UAs
   enable users to elect to continue to interact with a web resource's
   host in the face of such issues.  This behavior is sometimes referred
   to as "click(ing) through" security [GoodDhamijaEtAl05]
   [SunshineEgelmanEtAl09]; thus, it can be described as "click-through
   insecurity".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A key vulnerability enabled by click-through insecurity is the
   leaking of any cookies the web resource may be using to manage a
   user's session.  The threat here is that an attacker could obtain the
   cookies and then interact with the legitimate web resource while
   impersonating the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Jackson and Barth proposed an approach, in [ForceHTTPS], to enable
   web resources to declare that any interactions by UAs with the web
   resource must be conducted securely and that any issues with
   establishing a secure transport session are to be treated as fatal
   and without direct user recourse.  The aim is to prevent click-
   through insecurity and address other potential threats.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification embodies and refines the approach proposed in
   [ForceHTTPS].  For example, rather than using a cookie to convey
   policy from a web resource's host to a UA, it defines an HTTP
   response header field for this purpose.  Additionally, a web
   resource's host may declare its policy to apply to the entire domain
   name subtree rooted at its host name.  This enables HTTP Strict
   Transport Security (HSTS) to protect so-called "domain cookies",
   which are applied to all subdomains of a given web resource's host
   name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification also incorporates notions from [JacksonBarth2008]
   in that policy is applied on an "entire-host" basis: it applies to
   HTTP (only) over any TCP port of the issuing host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the policy defined by this specification is distinctly
   different than the "same-origin policy" defined in "The Web Origin
   Concept" [RFC6454].  These differences are summarized in Appendix B.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Organization of This Specification</h3></a>

   This specification begins with an overview of the use cases, policy
   effects, threat models, and requirements for HSTS (in Section 2).
   Then, Section 3 defines conformance requirements.  Section 4 defines
   terminology relevant to this document.  The HSTS mechanism itself is
   formally specified in Sections 5 through 15.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Document Conventions</h3></a>

   NOTE:  This is a note to the reader.  These are points that should be
          expressly kept in mind and/or considered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overview</h2></a>

   This section discusses the use cases, summarizes the HSTS Policy, and
   continues with a discussion of the threat model, non-addressed
   threats, and derived requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Use Cases</h3></a>

   The high-level use case is a combination of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Web browser user wishes to interact with various web sites (some
      arbitrary, some known) in a secure fashion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Web site deployer wishes to offer their site in an explicitly
      secure fashion for their own, as well as their users', benefit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   HTTP Strict Transport Security Policy Effects</h3></a>

   The effects of the HSTS Policy, as applied by a conformant UA in
   interactions with a web resource host wielding such policy (known as
   an HSTS Host), are summarized as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  UAs transform insecure URI references to an HSTS Host into secure
       URI references before dereferencing them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  The UA terminates any secure transport connection attempts upon
       any and all secure transport errors or warnings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Threat Model</h3></a>

   HSTS is concerned with three threat classes: passive network
   attackers, active network attackers, and imperfect web developers.
   However, it is explicitly not a remedy for two other classes of
   threats: phishing and malware.  Threats that are addressed, as well
   as threats that are not addressed, are briefly discussed below.
   Readers may wish to refer to Section 2 of [ForceHTTPS] for details as
   well as relevant citations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.1"><h4>2.3.1   Threats Addressed</h4></a>

<a name="section-2.3.1.1"><h4>2.3.1.1   Passive Network Attackers</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6797.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   When a user browses the web on a local wireless network (e.g., an
   802.11-based wireless local area network) a nearby attacker can
   possibly eavesdrop on the user's unencrypted Internet Protocol-based
   connections, such as HTTP, regardless of whether or not the local
   wireless network itself is secured [BeckTews09].  Freely available
   wireless sniffing toolkits (e.g., [Aircrack-ng]) enable such passive
   eavesdropping attacks, even if the local wireless network is
   operating in a secure fashion.  A passive network attacker using such
   tools can steal session identifiers/cookies and hijack the user's web
   session(s) by obtaining cookies containing authentication credentials
   [ForceHTTPS].  For example, there exist widely available tools, such
   as Firesheep (a web browser extension) [Firesheep], that enable their
   wielder to obtain other local users' session cookies for various web
   applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To mitigate such threats, some web sites support, but usually do not
   force, access using end-to-end secure transport -- e.g., signaled
   through URIs constructed with the "https" scheme [RFC2818].  This can
   lead users to believe that accessing such services using secure
   transport protects them from passive network attackers.
   Unfortunately, this is often not the case in real-world deployments,
   as session identifiers are often stored in non-Secure cookies to
   permit interoperability with versions of the service offered over
   insecure transport ("Secure cookies" are those cookies containing the
   "Secure" attribute [RFC6265]).  For example, if the session
   identifier for a web site (an email service, say) is stored in a
   non-Secure cookie, it permits an attacker to hijack the user's
   session if the user's UA makes a single insecure HTTP request to the
   site.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-2.3.1.2"><h4>2.3.1.2   Active Network Attackers</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6797.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   A determined attacker can mount an active attack, either by
   impersonating a user's DNS server or, in a wireless network, by
   spoofing network frames or offering a similarly named evil twin
   access point.  If the user is behind a wireless home router, an
   attacker can attempt to reconfigure the router using default
   passwords and other vulnerabilities.  Some sites, such as banks, rely
   on end-to-end secure transport to protect themselves and their users
   from such active attackers.  Unfortunately, browsers allow their
   users to easily opt out of these protections in order to be usable
   for sites that incorrectly deploy secure transport, for example by
   generating and self-signing their own certificates (without also
   distributing their certification authority (CA) certificate to their
   users' browsers).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-2.3.1.3"><h4>2.3.1.3   Web Site Development and Deployment Bugs</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6797.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   The security of an otherwise uniformly secure site (i.e., all of its
   content is materialized via "https" URIs) can be compromised
   completely by an active attacker exploiting a simple mistake, such as
   the loading of a cascading style sheet or a SWF (Shockwave Flash)
   movie over an insecure connection (both cascading style sheets and
   SWF movies can script the embedding page, to the surprise of many web
   developers, plus some browsers do not issue so-called "mixed content
   warnings" when SWF files are embedded via insecure connections).
   Even if the site's developers carefully scrutinize their login page
   for "mixed content", a single insecure embedding anywhere on the
   overall site compromises the security of their login page because an
   attacker can script (i.e., control) the login page by injecting code
   (e.g., a script) into another, insecurely loaded, site page.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE:  "Mixed content" as used above (see also Section 5.3 in
          [W3C.REC-wsc-ui-20100812]) refers to the notion termed "mixed
          security context" in this specification and should not be
          confused with the same "mixed content" term used in the
          context of markup languages such as XML and HTML.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.2"><h4>2.3.2   Threats Not Addressed</h4></a>

<a name="section-2.3.2.1"><h4>2.3.2.1   Phishing</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6797.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   Phishing attacks occur when an attacker solicits authentication
   credentials from the user by hosting a fake site located on a
   different domain than the real site, perhaps driving traffic to the
   fake site by sending a link in an email message.  Phishing attacks
   can be very effective because users find it difficult to distinguish
   the real site from a fake site.  HSTS is not a defense against
   phishing per se; rather, it complements many existing phishing
   defenses by instructing the browser to protect session integrity and
   long-lived authentication tokens [ForceHTTPS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-2.3.2.2"><h4>2.3.2.2   Malware and Browser Vulnerabilities</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6797.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   Because HSTS is implemented as a browser security mechanism, it
   relies on the trustworthiness of the user's system to protect the
   session.  Malicious code executing on the user's system can
   compromise a browser session, regardless of whether HSTS is used.
	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Requirements</h3></a>

   This section identifies and enumerates various requirements derived
   from the use cases and the threats discussed above and also lists the
   detailed core requirements that HTTP Strict Transport Security
   addresses, as well as ancillary requirements that are not directly
   addressed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4.1"><h4>2.4.1   Overall Requirement</h4></a>

   o  Minimize, for web browser users and web site deployers, the risks
      that are derived from passive and active network attackers, web
      site development and deployment bugs, and insecure user actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-2.4.1.1"><h4>2.4.1.1   Detailed Core Requirements</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc6797.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   These core requirements are derived from the overall requirement and
   are addressed by this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Web sites need to be able to declare to UAs that they should be
       accessed using a strict security policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  Web sites need to be able to instruct UAs that contact them
       insecurely to do so securely.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  UAs need to retain persistent data about web sites that signal
       strict security policy enablement, for time spans declared by the
       web sites.  Additionally, UAs need to cache the "freshest" strict
       security policy information, in order to allow web sites to
       update the information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  UAs need to rewrite all insecure UA "http" URI loads to use the

   This section provides an overview of the mechanism by which an HSTS
   Host conveys its HSTS Policy to UAs and how UAs process the HSTS
   Policies received from HSTS Hosts.  The mechanism details are
   specified in Sections 6 through 15.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   HSTS Host Declaration</h3></a>

   An HTTP host declares itself an HSTS Host by issuing to UAs an HSTS
   Policy, which is represented by and conveyed via the
   Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header field over secure
   transport (e.g., TLS).  Upon error-free receipt and processing of
   this header by a conformant UA, the UA regards the host as a Known
   HSTS Host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   HSTS Policy</h3></a>

   An HSTS Policy directs UAs to communicate with a Known HSTS Host only
   over secure transport and specifies policy retention time duration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HSTS Policy explicitly overrides the UA processing of URI references,
   user input (e.g., via the "location bar"), or other information that,
   in the absence of HSTS Policy, might otherwise cause UAs to
   communicate insecurely with the Known HSTS Host.
   An HSTS Policy may contain an optional directive -- includeSubDomains
   -- specifying that this HSTS Policy also applies to any hosts whose
   domain names are subdomains of the Known HSTS Host's domain name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   HSTS Policy Storage and Maintenance by User Agents</h3></a>

   UAs store and index HSTS Policies based strictly upon the domain
   names of the issuing HSTS Hosts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This means that UAs will maintain the HSTS Policy of any given HSTS
   Host separately from any HSTS Policies issued by any other HSTS Hosts
   whose domain names are superdomains or subdomains of the given HSTS
   Host's domain name.  Only the given HSTS Host can update or can cause
   deletion of its issued HSTS Policy.  It accomplishes this by sending
   Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header fields to UAs with new
   values for policy time duration and subdomain applicability.  Thus,
   UAs cache the "freshest" HSTS Policy information on behalf of an HSTS
   Host.  Specifying a zero time duration signals the UA to delete the
   HSTS Policy (including any asserted includeSubDomains directive) for
   that HSTS Host.  See Section 8.1 ("Strict-Transport-Security Response
   Header Field Processing") for details.  Additionally, Section 6.2
   presents examples of Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header
   fields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   User Agent HSTS Policy Enforcement</h3></a>

   When establishing an HTTP connection to a given host, however
   instigated, the UA examines its cache of Known HSTS Hosts to see if
   there are any with domain names that are superdomains of the given
   host's domain name.  If any are found, and of those if any have the
   includeSubDomains directive asserted, then HSTS Policy applies to the
   given host.  Otherwise, HSTS Policy applies to the given host only if
   the given host is itself known to the UA as an HSTS Host.  See
   Section 8.3 ("URI Loading and Port Mapping") for details.

   response header field and its directives, and presents some examples.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 7 ("Server Processing Model") then details how hosts employ
   this header field to declare their HSTS Policy, and Section 8 ("User

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Strict-Transport-Security HTTP Response Header Field</h3></a>

   The Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header field (STS header
   field) indicates to a UA that it MUST enforce the HSTS Policy in
   regards to the host emitting the response message containing this
   header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the STS header field
   is given below.  It is based on the Generic Grammar defined in
   Section 2 of [RFC2616] (which includes a notion of "implied linear
   whitespace", also known as "implied *LWS").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Strict-Transport-Security = "Strict-Transport-Security" ":"
                                 [ directive ]  *( ";" [ directive ] )

     quoted-string  = <quoted-string, defined in [RFC2616], Section 2.2>

   The two directives defined in this specification are described below.
   The overall requirements for directives are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The order of appearance of directives is not significant.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  All directives MUST appear only once in an STS header field.
       Directives are either optional or required, as stipulated in
       their definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  Directive names are case-insensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  UAs MUST ignore any STS header field containing directives, or
       other header field value data, that does not conform to the
       syntax defined in this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  If an STS header field contains directive(s) not recognized by
       the UA, the UA MUST ignore the unrecognized directives, and if
       the STS header field otherwise satisfies the above requirements
       (1 through 4), the UA MUST process the recognized directives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional directives extending the semantic functionality of the STS
   header field can be defined in other specifications, with a registry
   (having an IANA policy definition of IETF Review [RFC5226]) defined
   for them at such time.
   NOTE:  Such future directives will be ignored by UAs implementing
          only this specification, as well as by generally
          non-conforming UAs.  See Section 14.2 ("Non-Conformant User
          Agent Implications") for further discussion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.1"><h4>6.1.1   The max-age Directive</h4></a>

   The REQUIRED "max-age" directive specifies the number of seconds,
   after the reception of the STS header field, during which the UA
   regards the host (from whom the message was received) as a Known HSTS
   Host.  See also Section 8.1.1 ("Noting an HSTS Host - Storage
   Model").  The delta-seconds production is specified in [RFC2616].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax of the max-age directive's REQUIRED value (after

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    max-age-value = delta-seconds

    delta-seconds = <1*DIGIT, defined in [RFC2616], Section 3.3.2>

   NOTE:  A max-age value of zero (i.e., "max-age=0") signals the UA to
          cease regarding the host as a Known HSTS Host, including the
          includeSubDomains directive (if asserted for that HSTS Host).
          See also Section 8.1 ("Strict-Transport-Security Response
          Header Field Processing").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.2"><h4>6.1.2   The includeSubDomains Directive</h4></a>

   The OPTIONAL "includeSubDomains" directive is a valueless directive
   which, if present (i.e., it is "asserted"), signals the UA that the
   HSTS Policy applies to this HSTS Host as well as any subdomains of
   the host's domain name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Examples</h3></a>

   The HSTS header field below stipulates that the HSTS Policy is to

   seconds in a year), and the policy applies only to the domain of the
   HSTS Host issuing it:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000

   The HSTS header field below stipulates that the HSTS Policy is to

   applies to the domain of the issuing HSTS Host and all of its
   subdomains:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000 ; includeSubDomains
   The max-age directive value can optionally be quoted:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age="31536000"

   field:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=0

   The HSTS header field below has exactly the same effect as the one

	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Server Processing Model</h2></a>

   This section describes the processing model that HSTS Hosts
   implement.  The model comprises two facets: the first being the
   processing rules for HTTP request messages received over a secure
   transport (TLS [RFC5246] or SSL [RFC6101]; see also Section 14.1
   ("Underlying Secure Transport Considerations")), and the second being
   the processing rules for HTTP request messages received over

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   HTTP-over-Secure-Transport Request Type</h3></a>

   When replying to an HTTP request that was conveyed over a secure
   transport, an HSTS Host SHOULD include in its response message an STS
   header field that MUST satisfy the grammar specified above in
   Section 6.1 ("Strict-Transport-Security HTTP Response Header Field").
   If an STS header field is included, the HSTS Host MUST include only
   one such header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Establishing a given host as a Known HSTS Host, in the context of a

   mechanisms, such as a client-side pre-loaded Known HSTS Host list,
   MAY also be used; e.g., see Section 12 ("User Agent Implementation
   Advice").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE:  Including the STS header field is stipulated as a "SHOULD" in

   (Section 10.3.2 of [RFC2616]), and a Location header field value
   containing either the HTTP request's original Effective Request URI
   (see Section 9 ("Constructing an Effective Request URI")) altered as
   necessary to have a URI scheme of "https", or a URI generated
   according to local policy with a URI scheme of "https".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "constant value into the future" approach can be accomplished by

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "fixed point in time" approach can be accomplished by sending
   max-age values that represent the remaining time until the desired

       Certificates

   If all four of the following conditions are true...

   o  that organization's root certification authority (CA) certificate
      is not typically embedded by default in browser and/or operating

   o  HSTS Policy is enabled on a host identifying itself using a
      certificate signed by the organization's CA (i.e., a "self-signed

   o  this certificate does not match a usable TLS certificate
      association (as defined by Section 4 of the TLSA protocol
      specification [RFC6698]),

   ...then secure connections to that site will fail, per the HSTS
   design.  This is to protect against various active attacks, as
   discussed above.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, if said organization wishes to employ its own CA, and self-
   signed certificates, in concert with HSTS, it can do so by deploying
   its root CA certificate to its users' browsers or operating system CA
   root certificate stores.  It can also, in addition or instead,
   distribute to its users' browsers the end-entity certificate(s) for
   specific hosts.  There are various ways in which this can be
   accomplished (details are out of scope for this specification).  Once
   its root CA certificate is installed in the browsers, it may employ
   HSTS Policy on its site(s).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Alternatively, that organization can deploy the TLSA protocol; all
   browsers that also use TLSA will then be able to trust the
   certificates identified by usable TLS certificate associations as
   denoted via TLSA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE:  Interactively distributing root CA certificates to users,
          e.g., via email, and having the users install them, is

          form of phishing attack.  See Section 14.8 ("Bogus Root CA
          Certificate Phish plus DNS Cache Poisoning Attack").  Thus,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The sections below discuss each of these scenarios in turn.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.4.1"><h4>11.4.1   Considerations for Offering Unsecured HTTP Services at</h4></a>
         Alternate Ports or Subdomains of an HSTS Host

   For example, certification authorities often offer their CRL
   distribution and OCSP services [RFC2560] over plain HTTP, and
   sometimes at a subdomain of a publicly available web application that
   may be secured by TLS/SSL.  For example, <https://ca.example.com/> is
   a publicly available web application for "Example CA", a
   certification authority.  Customers use this web application to
   register their public keys and obtain certificates.  "Example CA"
   generates certificates for customers containing
   <http://crl-and-ocsp.ca.example.com/> as the value for the "CRL
   Distribution Points" and "Authority Information Access:OCSP"
   certificate fields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If ca.example.com were to issue an HSTS Policy with the
   includeSubDomains directive, then HTTP-based user agents implementing
   HSTS that have interacted with the ca.example.com web application
   would fail to retrieve CRLs and fail to check OCSP for certificates,
   because these services are offered over plain HTTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this case, Example CA can either:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  not use the includeSubDomains directive, or

   o  ensure that HTTP-based services offered at subdomains of
      ca.example.com are also uniformly offered over TLS/SSL, or
   o  offer plain HTTP-based services at a different domain name, e.g.,
      crl-and-ocsp.ca.example.NET, or

   o  utilize an alternative approach to distributing certificate status
      information, obviating the need to offer CRL distribution and OCSP
      services over plain HTTP (e.g., the "Certificate Status Request"
      TLS extension [RFC6066], often colloquially referred to as "OCSP

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE:  The above points are expressly only an example and do not

         an HSTS Host

   In this scenario, an HSTS Host declares an HSTS Policy with an
   includeSubDomains directive, and there also exist distinct web
   applications offered at distinct subdomains of the HSTS Host such
   that UAs often interact directly with these subdomain web
   applications without having necessarily interacted with the HSTS
   Host.  In such a case, the UAs will not receive or enforce the HSTS
   Policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, the HSTS Host is "example.com", and it is configured to
   emit the STS header field with the includeSubDomains directive.
   However, example.com's actual web application is addressed at
   "www.example.com", and example.com simply redirects user agents to
   "https://www.example.com/".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the STS header field is only emitted by "example.com" but UAs
   typically bookmark -- and links (from anywhere on the web) are
   typically established to -- "www.example.com", and "example.com" is
   not contacted directly by all user agents in some non-zero percentage
   of interactions, then some number of UAs will not note "example.com"
   as an HSTS Host, and some number of users of "www.example.com" will
   be unprotected by HSTS Policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To address this, HSTS Hosts should be configured such that the STS
   header field is emitted directly at each HSTS Host domain or
   subdomain name that constitutes a well-known "entry point" to one's
   web application(s), whether or not the includeSubDomains directive is
   employed.
   Thus, in our example, if the STS header field is emitted from both
   "example.com" and "www.example.com", this issue will be addressed.
   Also, if there are any other well-known entry points to web
   applications offered by "example.com", such as "foo.example.com",
   they should also be configured to emit the STS header field.

   Failing secure connection establishment on any warnings or errors
   (per Section 8.4 ("Errors in Secure Transport Establishment")) should

   are named "Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA)".
   At this time, there are two such specification suites: IDNA2008
   [RFC5890] and its predecessor IDNA2003 [RFC3490].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IDNA2008 obsoletes IDNA2003, but there are differences between the
   two specifications, and thus there can be differences in processing
   (e.g., converting) domain name labels that have been registered under
   one from those registered under the other.  There will be a
   transition period of some time during which IDNA2003-based domain
   name labels will exist in the wild.  In order to facilitate their
   IDNA transition, user agents SHOULD implement IDNA2008 [RFC5890] and
   MAY implement [RFC5895] (see also Section 7 of [RFC5894]) or [UTS46].
   If a user agent does not implement IDNA2008, the user agent MUST
   implement IDNA2003.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14"><h2>14.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This specification concerns the expression, conveyance, and
   enforcement of the HSTS Policy.  The overall HSTS Policy threat
   model, including addressed and unaddressed threats, is given in
   Section 2.3 ("Threat Model").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, the sections below discuss operational ramifications of
   the HSTS Policy, provide feature rationale, discuss potential HSTS
   Policy misuse, and highlight some known vulnerabilities in the HSTS
   Policy regime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.1"><h3>14.1   Underlying Secure Transport Considerations</h3></a>

   This specification is fashioned to be independent of the secure
   transport underlying HTTP.  However, the threat analysis and
   requirements in Section 2 ("Overview") in fact presume TLS or SSL as
   the underlying secure transport.  Thus, employment of HSTS in the
   context of HTTP running over some other secure transport protocol
   would require assessment of that secure transport protocol's security
   model in conjunction with the specifics of how HTTP is layered over
   it in order to assess HSTS's subsequent security properties in that
   context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.2"><h3>14.2   Non-Conformant User Agent Implications</h3></a>

   Non-conformant user agents ignore the Strict-Transport-Security
   header field; thus, non-conformant user agents do not address the
   threats described in Section 2.3.1 ("Threats Addressed").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This means that the web application and its users wielding
   non-conformant UAs will be vulnerable to both of the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Passive network attacks due to web site development and deployment
      bugs:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For example, if the web application contains any insecure
         references (e.g., "http") to the web application server, and if
         not all of its cookies are flagged as "Secure", then its
         cookies will be vulnerable to passive network sniffing and,
         potentially, subsequent misuse of user credentials.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Active network attacks:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For example, if an attacker is able to place a "man in the
         middle", secure transport connection attempts will likely yield
         warnings to the user, but without HSTS Policy being enforced,
         the present common practice is to allow the user to "click
         through" and proceed.  This renders the user and possibly the
         web application open to abuse by such an attacker.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is essentially the status quo for all web applications and their
   users in the absence of HSTS Policy.  Since web application providers
   typically do not control the type or version of UAs their web
   applications interact with, the implication is that HSTS Host
   deployers must generally exercise the same level of care to avoid web
   site development and deployment bugs (see Section 2.3.1.3) as they
   would if they were not asserting HSTS Policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.3"><h3>14.3   Ramifications of HSTS Policy Establishment Only over Error-Free</h3></a>
       Secure Transport

   The user agent processing model defined in Section 8 ("User Agent
   Processing Model") stipulates that a host is initially noted as a
   Known HSTS Host, or that updates are made to a Known HSTS Host's
   cached information, only if the UA receives the STS header field over
   a secure transport connection having no underlying secure transport
   errors or warnings.
   The rationale behind this is that if there is a "man in the middle"
   (MITM) -- whether a legitimately deployed proxy or an illegitimate
   entity -- it could cause various mischief (see also Appendix A
   ("Design Decision Notes") item 3, as well as Section 14.6 ("Bootstrap
   MITM Vulnerability")); for example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Unauthorized notation of the host as a Known HSTS Host,
      potentially leading to a denial-of-service situation if the host
      does not uniformly offer its services over secure transport (see
      also Section 14.5 ("Denial of Service")).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Resetting the time to live for the host's designation as a Known
      HSTS Host by manipulating the max-age header field parameter value
      that is returned to the UA.  If max-age is returned as zero, this
      will cause the host to cease being regarded as a Known HSTS Host
      by the UA, leading to either insecure connections to the host or
      possibly denial of service if the host delivers its services only
      over secure transport.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, this means that if a UA is "behind" a MITM non-transparent
   TLS proxy -- within a corporate intranet, for example -- and
   interacts with an unknown HSTS Host beyond the proxy, the user could
   possibly be presented with the legacy secure connection error
   dialogs.  Even if the risk is accepted and the user "clicks through",
   the host will not be noted as an HSTS Host.  Thus, as long as the UA
   is behind such a proxy, the user will be vulnerable and will possibly
   be presented with the legacy secure connection error dialogs for
   as-yet unknown HSTS Hosts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once the UA successfully connects to an unknown HSTS Host over error-
   free secure transport, the host will be noted as a Known HSTS Host.
   This will result in the failure of subsequent connection attempts
   from behind interfering proxies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above discussion relates to the recommendation in Section 12
   ("User Agent Implementation Advice") that the secure connection be
   terminated with "no user recourse" whenever there are warnings and
   errors and the host is a Known HSTS Host.  Such a posture protects
   users from "clicking through" security warnings and putting
   themselves at risk.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.4"><h3>14.4   The Need for includeSubDomains</h3></a>

   Without the includeSubDomains directive, a web application would not
   be able to adequately protect so-called "domain cookies" (even if
   these cookies have their "Secure" flag set and thus are conveyed only
   on secure channels).  These are cookies the web application expects
   UAs to return to any and all subdomains of the web application.
   For example, suppose example.com represents the top-level DNS name
   for a web application.  Further suppose that this cookie is set for
   the entire example.com domain, i.e., it is a "domain cookie", and it
   has its Secure flag set.  Suppose example.com is a Known HSTS Host
   for this UA, but the includeSubDomains directive is not set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Now, if an attacker causes the UA to request a subdomain name that is
   unlikely to already exist in the web application, such as
   "https://uxdhbpahpdsf.example.com/", but that the attacker has
   managed to register in the DNS and point at an HTTP server under the
   attacker's control, then:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The UA is unlikely to already have an HSTS Policy established for
       "uxdhbpahpdsf.example.com".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  The HTTP request sent to uxdhbpahpdsf.example.com will include
       the Secure-flagged domain cookie.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  If "uxdhbpahpdsf.example.com" returns a certificate during TLS
       establishment, and the user "clicks through" any warning that
       might be presented (it is possible, but not certain, that one may
       obtain a requisite certificate for such a domain name such that a
       warning may or may not appear), then the attacker can obtain the
       Secure-flagged domain cookie that's ostensibly being protected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Without the "includeSubDomains" directive, HSTS is unable to protect
   such Secure-flagged domain cookies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.5"><h3>14.5   Denial of Service</h3></a>

   HSTS could be used to mount certain forms of Denial-of-Service (DoS)
   attacks against web sites.  A DoS attack is an attack in which one or
   more network entities target a victim entity and attempt to prevent
   the victim from doing useful work.  This section discusses such
   scenarios in terms of HSTS, though this list is not exhaustive.  See
   also [RFC4732] for a discussion of overall Internet DoS
   considerations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Web applications available over HTTP

      There is an opportunity for perpetrating DoS attacks with web
      applications (or critical portions of them) that are available
      only over HTTP without secure transport, if attackers can cause
      UAs to set HSTS Policy for such web applications' host(s).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This is because once the HSTS Policy is set for a web
      application's host in a UA, the UA will only use secure transport
      to communicate with the host.  If the host is not using secure
      transport or is not using it for critical portions of its web
      application, then the web application will be rendered unusable
      for the UA's user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NOTE:  This is a use case for UAs to offer an "HSTS Policy
             deletion" feature as noted in Section 12.5 ("HSTS Policy
             Deletion").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An HSTS Policy can be set for a victim host in various ways:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  If the web application has an HTTP response splitting
         vulnerability [CWE-113] (which can be abused in order to
         facilitate "HTTP header injection").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  If an attacker can spoof a redirect from an insecure victim
         site, e.g., <http://example.com/> to <https://example.com/>,
         where the latter is attacker-controlled and has an apparently
         valid certificate.  In this situation, the attacker can then
         set an HSTS Policy for example.com and also for all subdomains
         of example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  If an attacker can convince users to manually configure HSTS
         Policy for a victim host.  This assumes that their UAs offer
         such a capability (see Section 12 ("User Agent Implementation
         Advice")).  Alternatively, if such UA configuration is
         scriptable, then an attacker can cause UAs to execute his
         script and set HSTS Policies for whichever desired domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Inadvertent use of includeSubDomains

      The includeSubDomains directive instructs UAs to automatically
      regard all subdomains of the given HSTS Host as Known HSTS Hosts.
      If any such subdomains do not support properly configured secure
      transport, then they will be rendered unreachable from such UAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.6"><h3>14.6   Bootstrap MITM Vulnerability</h3></a>

   Bootstrap MITM (man-in-the-middle) vulnerability is a vulnerability
   that users and HSTS Hosts encounter in the situation where the user
   manually enters, or follows a link, to an unknown HSTS Host using an
   "http" URI rather than an "https" URI.  Because the UA uses an
   insecure channel in the initial attempt to interact with the
   specified server, such an initial interaction is vulnerable to
   various attacks (see Section 5.3 of [ForceHTTPS]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE:  There are various features/facilities that UA implementations
          may employ in order to mitigate this vulnerability.  Please
          see Section 12 ("User Agent Implementation Advice").
	<a name="section-14.7"><h3>14.7   Network Time Attacks</h3></a>

   Active network attacks can subvert network time protocols (such as
   the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905]) -- making HSTS less
   effective against clients that trust NTP or lack a real time clock.
   Network time attacks are beyond the scope of this specification.
   Note that modern operating systems use NTP by default.  See also
   Section 2.10 of [RFC4732].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.8"><h3>14.8   Bogus Root CA Certificate Phish plus DNS Cache Poisoning Attack</h3></a>

   An attacker could conceivably obtain users' login credentials
   belonging to a victim HSTS-protected web application via a bogus root
   CA certificate phish plus DNS cache poisoning attack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, the attacker could first convince users of a victim web
   application (which is protected by HSTS Policy) to install the
   attacker's version of a root CA certificate purporting (falsely) to
   represent the CA of the victim web application.  This might be
   accomplished by sending the users a phishing email message with a
   link to such a certificate, which their browsers may offer to install
   if clicked on.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Then, if the attacker can perform an attack on the users' DNS
   servers, (e.g., via cache poisoning) and turn on HSTS Policy for
   their fake web application, the affected users' browsers would access
   the attacker's web application rather than the legitimate web
   application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This type of attack leverages vectors that are outside of the scope
   of HSTS.  However, the feasibility of such threats can be mitigated
   by including in a web application's overall deployment approach
   appropriate employment, in addition to HSTS, of security facilities
   such as DNS Security Extensions [RFC4033], plus techniques to block
   email phishing and fake certificate injection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.9"><h3>14.9   Creative Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store</h3></a>

   Since an HSTS Host may select its own host name and subdomains
   thereof, and this information is cached in the HSTS Policy store of
   conforming UAs, it is possible for those who control one or more HSTS
   Hosts to encode information into domain names they control and cause
   such UAs to cache this information as a matter of course in the
   process of noting the HSTS Host.  This information can be retrieved
   by other hosts through cleverly constructed and loaded web resources,
   causing the UA to send queries to (variations of) the encoded domain
   names.  Such queries can reveal whether the UA had previously visited
   the original HSTS Host (and subdomains).
   Such a technique could potentially be abused as yet another form of
   "web tracking" [WebTracking].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.10"><h3>14.10   Internationalized Domain Names</h3></a>

   Internet security relies in part on the DNS and the domain names it
   hosts.  Domain names are used by users to identify and connect to
   Internet hosts and other network resources.  For example, Internet
   security is compromised if a user entering an internationalized
   domain name (IDN) is connected to different hosts based on different
   interpretations of the IDN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The processing models specified in this specification assume that the
   domain names they manipulate are IDNA-canonicalized, and that the
   canonicalization process correctly performed all appropriate IDNA and
   Unicode validations and character list testing per the requisite
   specifications (e.g., as noted in Section 10 ("Domain Name IDNA-
   Canonicalization")).  These steps are necessary in order to avoid
   various potentially compromising situations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In brief, examples of issues that could stem from lack of careful and
   consistent Unicode and IDNA validations include unexpected processing
   exceptions, truncation errors, and buffer overflows, as well as
   false-positive and/or false-negative domain name matching results.
   Any of the foregoing issues could possibly be leveraged by attackers
   in various ways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, IDNA2008 [RFC5890] differs from IDNA2003 [RFC3490] in
   terms of disallowed characters and character mapping conventions.
   This situation can also lead to false-positive and/or false-negative
   domain name matching results, resulting in, for example, users
   possibly communicating with unintended hosts or not being able to
   reach intended hosts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For details, refer to the Security Considerations sections of
   [RFC5890], [RFC5891], and [RFC3490], as well as the specifications
   they normatively reference.  Additionally, [RFC5894] provides
   detailed background and rationale for IDNA2008 in particular, as well
   as IDNA and its issues in general, and should be consulted in
   conjunction with the former specifications.

Appendix A.  Design Decision Notes

   This appendix documents various design decisions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Cookies aren't appropriate for HSTS Policy expression, as they
       are potentially mutable (while stored in the UA); therefore, an
       HTTP header field is employed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  We chose to not attempt to specify how "mixed security context
       loads" (also known as "mixed content loads") are handled, due to
       UA implementation considerations as well as classification
       difficulties.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  An HSTS Host may update UA notions of HSTS Policy via new HSTS
       header field parameter values.  We chose to have UAs honor the
       "freshest" information received from a server because there is
       the chance of a web site sending out an erroneous HSTS Policy,
       such as a multi-year max-age value, and/or an incorrect
       includeSubDomains directive.  If the HSTS Host couldn't correct
       such errors over protocol, it would require some form of
       annunciation to users and manual intervention on the users' part,
       which could be a non-trivial problem for both web application
       providers and their users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  HSTS Hosts are identified only via domain names -- explicit IP
       address identification of all forms is excluded.  This is for
       simplification and also is in recognition of various issues with
       using direct IP address identification in concert with PKI-based
       security.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  The max-age approach of having the HSTS Host provide a simple
       integer number of seconds for a cached HSTS Policy time-to-live
       value, as opposed to an approach of stating an expiration time in
       the future, was chosen for various reasons.  Amongst the reasons
       are no need for clock synchronization, no need to define date and
       time value syntaxes (specification simplicity), and
       implementation simplicity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   6.  In determining whether port mapping was to be employed, the
       option of merely refusing to dereference any URL with an explicit
       port was considered.  It was felt, though, that the possibility
       that the URI to be dereferenced is incorrect (and there is indeed
       a valid HTTPS server at that port) is worth the small cost of
       possibly wasted HTTPS fetches to HTTP servers.
Appendix B.  Differences between HSTS Policy and Same-Origin Policy

   HSTS Policy has the following primary characteristics:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HSTS Policy stipulates requirements for the security
      characteristics of UA-to-host connection establishment, on a
      per-host basis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Hosts explicitly declare HSTS Policy to UAs.  Conformant UAs are
      obliged to implement hosts' declared HSTS Policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HSTS Policy is conveyed over protocol from the host to the UA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The UA maintains a cache of Known HSTS Hosts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      UAs apply HSTS Policy whenever making an HTTP connection to a
      Known HSTS Host, regardless of host port number; i.e., it applies
      to all ports on a Known HSTS Host.  Hosts are unable to affect
      this aspect of HSTS Policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Hosts may optionally declare that their HSTS Policy applies to all
      subdomains of their host domain name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In contrast, the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) [RFC6454] has the following
   primary characteristics:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An origin is the scheme, host, and port of a URI identifying a
      resource.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A UA may dereference a URI, thus loading a representation of the
      resource the URI identifies.  UAs label resource representations
      with their origins, which are derived from their URIs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The SOP refers to a collection of principles, implemented within
      UAs, governing the isolation of and communication between resource
      representations within the UA, as well as resource
      representations' access to network resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In summary, although both HSTS Policy and SOP are enforced by UAs,
   HSTS Policy is optionally declared by hosts and is not origin-based,
   while the SOP applies to all resource representations loaded from all
   hosts by conformant UAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Thanks to Julian Reschke for his elegant rewriting of the effective
   request URI text, which he did when incorporating the ERU notion into
   the updates to HTTP/1.1 [HTTP1_1-UPD].  Subsequently, the ERU text in
   this spec was lifted from Julian's work in the updated HTTP/1.1
   (part 1) specification and adapted to the [RFC2616] ABNF.
