</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   Prior to the publication of RFC 2489 (which was updated by RFC 2939),
   several option codes were assigned to proposed Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options that were subsequently never
   used.  This document lists those unused option codes and directs IANA
   to make these option codes available for assignment to other DHCP
   options in the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The document also lists several option codes that are not currently
   documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
   reassignment to future DHCP options.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   Section 2 of this document lists the unused DHCP option codes from
   the IANA list of BOOTP and DHCP option codes [1].  Each option code
   includes any known documentation and contact information from the
   IANA list.  IANA will make these option codes available for
   assignment to other DHCP options in the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 3 lists several DHCP option codes that are not currently
   documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
   reassignment to future DHCP options.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Unused DHCP Option Codes to be Reassigned to Future DHCP Options</h2></a>

   The option codes listed in this section are to be returned to IANA
   for reassignment to new options.  Responses from associated contact
   persons are noted where they have been received.

   This document has no known security implications, as none of the

   IANA has returned the DHCP option codes listed in Section 2 to the
   list of available option codes.  These option codes may be reassigned
   to new DHCP options, according to the procedures in RFC 2939 [6].
   IANA is requested to reassign these option codes after the list of
   option codes that have never been assigned or have previously been
   returned has been exhausted.
