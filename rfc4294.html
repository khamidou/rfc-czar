   This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes.  It is expected
   that IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and situations.
   Specifying the requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6 to function
   well and interoperate in a large number of situations and
   deployments.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The goal of this document is to define the common functionality
   required from both IPv6 hosts and routers.  Many IPv6 nodes will
   implement optional or additional features, but this document
   summarizes requirements from other published Standards Track
   documents in one place.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document tries to avoid discussion of protocol details, and
   references RFCs for this purpose.  This document is informational in
   nature and does not update Standards Track RFCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although the document points to different specifications, it should
   be noted that in most cases, the granularity of requirements are
   smaller than a single specification, as many specifications define
   multiple, independent pieces, some of which may not be mandatory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As it is not always possible for an implementer to know the exact
   usage of IPv6 in a node, an overriding requirement for IPv6 nodes is
   that they should adhere to Jon Postel's Robustness Principle:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others [RFC-793].
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirement Language</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC-2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Scope of This Document</h3></a>

   IPv6 covers many specifications.  It is intended that IPv6 will be
   deployed in many different situations and environments.  Therefore,
   it is important to develop the requirements for IPv6 nodes to ensure
   interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document assumes that all IPv6 nodes meet the minimum
   requirements specified here.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   Description of IPv6 Nodes</h3></a>

   From the Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification
   [RFC-2460], we have the following definitions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Description of an IPv6 Node

         -  a device that implements IPv6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Description of an IPv6 router

         -  a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed
            to itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Description of an IPv6 Host

      -  any node that is not a router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Abbreviations Used in This Document</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Sub-IP Layer</h2></a>

   An IPv6 node must include support for one or more IPv6 link-layer
   specifications.  Which link-layer specifications are included will
   depend upon what link-layers are supported by the hardware available
   on the system.  It is possible for a conformant IPv6 node to support
   IPv6 on some of its interfaces and not on others.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As IPv6 is run over new layer 2 technologies, it is expected that new
   specifications will be issued.  This section highlights some major
   layer 2 technologies and is not intended to be complete.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks - RFC 2464</h3></a>

   Nodes supporting IPv6 over Ethernet interfaces MUST implement
   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks [RFC-2464].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   IP version 6 over PPP - RFC 2472</h3></a>

   Nodes supporting IPv6 over PPP MUST implement IPv6 over PPP
   [RFC-2472].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   IPv6 over ATM Networks - RFC 2492</h3></a>

   Nodes supporting IPv6 over ATM Networks MUST implement IPv6 over ATM
   Networks [RFC-2492].  Additionally, RFC 2492 states:
      A minimally conforming IPv6/ATM driver SHALL support the PVC mode
      of operation.  An IPv6/ATM driver that supports the full SVC mode
      SHALL also support PVC mode of operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IP Layer</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Internet Protocol Version 6 - RFC 2460</h3></a>

   The Internet Protocol Version 6 is specified in [RFC-2460].  This
   specification MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unrecognized options in Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options
   extensions MUST be processed as described in RFC 2460.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The node MUST follow the packet transmission rules in RFC 2460.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Nodes MUST always be able to send, receive, and process fragment
   headers.  All conformant IPv6 implementations MUST be capable of
   sending and receiving IPv6 packets; the forwarding functionality MAY
   be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 2460 specifies extension headers and the processing for these
   headers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A full implementation of IPv6 includes implementation of the
      following extension headers: Hop-by-Hop Options, Routing (Type 0),
      Fragment, Destination Options, Authentication and Encapsulating
      Security Payload [RFC-2460].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An IPv6 node MUST be able to process these headers.  It should be
   noted that there is some discussion about the use of Routing Headers
   and possible security threats [IPv6-RH] that they cause.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC 2461</h3></a>

   Neighbor Discovery SHOULD be supported.  [RFC-2461] states:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      "Unless specified otherwise (in a document that covers operating
      IP over a particular link type) this document applies to all link
      types.  However, because ND uses link-layer multicast for some of
      its services, it is possible that on some link types (e.g., NBMA
      links) alternative protocols or mechanisms to implement those
      services will be specified (in the appropriate document covering
      the operation of IP over a particular link type).  The services
      described in this document that are not directly dependent on
      multicast, such as Redirects, Next-hop determination, Neighbor
      Unreachability Detection, etc., are expected to be provided as
      specified in this document.  The details of how one uses ND on
      NBMA links is an area for further study."

   Some detailed analysis of Neighbor Discovery follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Router Discovery is how hosts locate routers that reside on an
   attached link.  Router Discovery MUST be supported for
   implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Prefix Discovery is how hosts discover the set of address prefixes
   that define which destinations are on-link for an attached link.
   Prefix discovery MUST be supported for implementations.  Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection (NUD) MUST be supported for all paths
   between hosts and neighboring nodes.  It is not required for paths
   between routers.  However, when a node receives a unicast Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS) message (that may be a NUD's NS), the node MUST
   respond to it (i.e., send a unicast Neighbor Advertisement).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Duplicate Address Detection MUST be supported on all links supporting
   link-layer multicast (RFC 2462, Section 5.4, specifies DAD MUST take
   place on all unicast addresses).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A host implementation MUST support sending Router Solicitations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Receiving and processing Router Advertisements MUST be supported for
   host implementations.  The ability to understand specific Router
   Advertisement options is dependent on supporting the specification
   where the RA is specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Sending and Receiving Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) MUST be supported.  NS and NA messages are
   required for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Redirect functionality SHOULD be supported.  If the node is a router,
   Redirect functionality MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Path MTU Discovery and Packet Size</h3></a>

	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   Path MTU Discovery - RFC 1981</h4></a>

   Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981] SHOULD be supported, though minimal
   implementations MAY choose to not support it and avoid large packets.
   The rules in RFC 2460 MUST be followed for packet fragmentation and
   reassembly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.2"><h4>4.3.2   IPv6 Jumbograms - RFC 2675</h4></a>

   IPv6 Jumbograms [RFC-2675] MAY be supported.
	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   ICMP for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) - RFC 2463</h3></a>

   ICMPv6 [RFC-2463] MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Addressing</h3></a>

	<a name="section-4.5.1"><h4>4.5.1   IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture - RFC 3513</h4></a>

   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-3513] MUST be supported as
   updated by [RFC-3879].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5.2"><h4>4.5.2   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration - RFC 2462</h4></a>

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is defined in [RFC-2462].
   This specification MUST be supported for nodes that are hosts.
   Static address can be supported as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Nodes that are routers MUST be able to generate link local addresses
   as described in RFC 2462 [RFC-2462].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   From 2462:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The autoconfiguration process specified in this document applies
      only to hosts and not routers.  Since host autoconfiguration uses
      information advertised by routers, routers will need to be
      configured by some other means.  However, it is expected that
      routers will generate link-local addresses using the mechanism
      described in this document.  In addition, routers are expected to
      successfully pass the Duplicate Address Detection procedure
      described in this document on all addresses prior to assigning
      them to an interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5.3"><h4>4.5.3   Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6 - RFC 3041</h4></a>

   Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC-3041]
   SHOULD be supported.  It is recommended that this behavior be
   configurable on a connection basis within each application when
   available.  It is noted that a number of applications do not work
   with addresses generated with this method, while other applications
   work quite well with them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5.4"><h4>4.5.4   Default Address Selection for IPv6 - RFC 3484</h4></a>

   The rules specified in the Default Address Selection for IPv6
   [RFC-3484] document MUST be implemented.  It is expected that IPv6
   nodes will need to deal with multiple addresses.
	<a name="section-4.5.5"><h4>4.5.5   Stateful Address Autoconfiguration</h4></a>

   Stateful Address Autoconfiguration MAY be supported.  DHCPv6
   [RFC-3315] is the standard stateful address configuration protocol;
   see Section 5.3 for DHCPv6 support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Nodes which do not support Stateful Address Autoconfiguration may be
   unable to obtain any IPv6 addresses, aside from link-local addresses,
   when it receives a router advertisement with the 'M' flag (Managed
   address configuration) set and that contains no prefixes advertised
   for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (see Section 4.5.2).
   Additionally, such nodes will be unable to obtain other configuration
   information, such as the addresses of DNS servers when it is
   connected to a link over which the node receives a router
   advertisement in which the 'O' flag ("Other stateful configuration")
   is set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6 - RFC 2710</h3></a>

   Nodes that need to join multicast groups SHOULD implement MLDv2
   [RFC-3810].  However, if the node has applications that only need
   support for Any-Source Multicast [RFC-3569], the node MAY implement
   MLDv1 [RFC-2710] instead.  If the node has applications that need
   support for Source-Specific Multicast [RFC-3569, SSM-ARCH], the node
   MUST support MLDv2 [RFC-3810].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When MLD is used, the rules in the "Source Address Selection for the
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Protocol" [RFC-3590] MUST be
   followed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   DNS and DHCP</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   DNS</h3></a>

   DNS is described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-1035], [RFC-3152], [RFC-3363],
   and [RFC-3596].  Not all nodes will need to resolve names; those that
   will never need to resolve DNS names do not need to implement
   resolver functionality.  However, the ability to resolve names is a
   basic infrastructure capability that applications rely on and
   generally needs to be supported.  All nodes that need to resolve
   names SHOULD implement stub-resolver [RFC-1034] functionality, as in
   RFC 1034, Section 5.3.1, with support for:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  AAAA type Resource Records [RFC-3596];

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  reverse addressing in ip6.arpa using PTR records [RFC-3152];
      -  EDNS0 [RFC-2671] to allow for DNS packet sizes larger than 512
         octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Those nodes are RECOMMENDED to support DNS security extensions
   [RFC-4033], [RFC-4034], and [RFC-4035].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Those nodes are NOT RECOMMENDED to support the experimental A6 and
   DNAME Resource Records [RFC-3363].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) - RFC 3315</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5.2.1"><h4>5.2.1   Managed Address Configuration</h4></a>

   The method by which IPv6 nodes that use DHCP for address assignment
   can obtain IPv6 addresses and other configuration information upon
   receipt of a Router Advertisement with the 'M' flag set is described
   in Section 5.5.3 of RFC 2462.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, in the absence of a router, those IPv6 nodes that use
   DHCP for address assignment MUST initiate DHCP to obtain IPv6
   addresses and other configuration information, as described in
   Section 5.5.2 of RFC 2462.  Those IPv6 nodes that do not use DHCP for
   address assignment can ignore the 'M' flag in Router Advertisements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.2"><h4>5.2.2   Other Configuration Information</h4></a>

   The method by which IPv6 nodes that use DHCP to obtain other

   described in Section 5.5.3 of RFC 2462.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Those IPv6 nodes that use DHCP to obtain other configuration
   information initiate DHCP for other configuration information upon

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Security</h2></a>

   This section describes the specification of IPsec for the IPv6 node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.1"><h3>8.1   Basic Architecture</h3></a>

   Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-4301] MUST be
   supported.
	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   Security Protocols</h3></a>

   ESP [RFC-4303] MUST be supported.  AH [RFC-4302] MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.3"><h3>8.3   Transforms and Algorithms</h3></a>

   Current IPsec RFCs specify the support of transforms and algorithms
   for use with AH and ESP: NULL encryption, DES-CBC, HMAC-SHA-1-96, and
   HMAC-MD5-96.  However, "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation
   Requirements For ESP And AH" [RFC-4305] contains the current set of
   mandatory to implement algorithms for ESP and AH.  It also specifies
   algorithms that should be implemented because they are likely to be
   promoted to mandatory at some future time.  IPv6 nodes SHOULD conform
   to the requirements in [RFC-4305], as well as the requirements
   specified below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since ESP encryption and authentication are both optional, support
   for the NULL encryption algorithm [RFC-2410] and the NULL
   authentication algorithm [RFC-4303] MUST be provided to maintain
   consistency with the way these services are negotiated.  However,
   while authentication and encryption can each be NULL, they MUST NOT
   both be NULL.  The NULL encryption algorithm is also useful for
   debugging.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The DES-CBC encryption algorithm [RFC-2405] SHOULD NOT be supported
   within ESP.  Security issues related to the use of DES are discussed
   in [DESDIFF], [DESINT], and [DESCRACK].  DES-CBC is still listed as
   required by the existing IPsec RFCs, but updates to these RFCs will
   be published in the near future.  DES provides 56 bits of protection,
   which is no longer considered sufficient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of the HMAC-SHA-1-96 algorithm [RFC-2404] within AH and ESP
   MUST be supported.  The use of the HMAC-MD5-96 algorithm [RFC-2403]
   within AH and ESP MAY also be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The 3DES-CBC encryption algorithm [RFC-2451] does not suffer from the
   same security issues as DES-CBC, and the 3DES-CBC algorithm within
   ESP MUST be supported to ensure interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The AES-128-CBC algorithm [RFC-3602] MUST also be supported within
   ESP.  AES-128 is expected to be a widely available, secure, and
   efficient algorithm.  While AES-128-CBC is not required by the
   current IPsec RFCs, it is expected to become required in the future.
	<a name="section-8.4"><h3>8.4   Key Management Methods</h3></a>

   An implementation MUST support the manual configuration of the
   security key and SPI.  The SPI configuration is needed in order to
   delineate between multiple keys.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Key management SHOULD be supported.  Examples of key management
   systems include IKEv2 [RFC-4306] and Kerberos; S/MIME and TLS include
   key management functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Where key refresh, anti-replay features of AH and ESP, or on-demand
   creation of Security Associations (SAs) is required, automated keying
   MUST be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Key management methods for multicast traffic are also being worked on
   by the MSEC WG.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Router-Specific Functionality</h2></a>

   This section defines general host considerations for IPv6 nodes that
   act as routers.  Currently, this section does not discuss routing-
   specific requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.1"><h3>9.1   General</h3></a>

	<a name="section-9.1.1"><h4>9.1.1   IPv6 Router Alert Option - RFC 2711</h4></a>

   The IPv6 Router Alert Option [RFC-2711] is an optional IPv6 Hop-by-
   Hop Header that is used in conjunction with some protocols (e.g.,
   RSVP [RFC-2205] or MLD [RFC-2710]).  The Router Alert option will
   need to be implemented whenever protocols that mandate its usage are
   implemented.  See Section 4.6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.1.2"><h4>9.1.2   Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC 2461</h4></a>

   Sending Router Advertisements and processing Router Solicitation MUST
   be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Network Management</h2></a>

   Network Management MAY be supported by IPv6 nodes.  However, for IPv6
   nodes that are embedded devices, network management may be the only
   possible way of controlling these nodes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.1"><h3>10.1   Management Information Base Modules (MIBs)</h3></a>

   The following two MIBs SHOULD be supported by nodes that support an
   SNMP agent.
	<a name="section-10.1.1"><h4>10.1.1   IP Forwarding Table MIB</h4></a>

   IP Forwarding Table MIB [RFC-4292] SHOULD be supported by nodes that
   support an SNMP agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.1.2"><h4>10.1.2   Management Information Base for the Internet Protocol (IP)</h4></a>

   IP MIB [RFC-4293] SHOULD be supported by nodes that support an SNMP
   agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document does not affect the security of the Internet, but
   implementations of IPv6 are expected to support a minimum set of
   security features to ensure security on the Internet.  "IP Security
   Document Roadmap" [RFC-2411] is important for everyone to read.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The security considerations in RFC 2460 state the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The security features of IPv6 are described in the Security
      Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-2401].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 2401 has been obsoleted by RFC 4301, therefore refer RFC 4301 for
   the security features of IPv6.
