                 IAX: Inter-Asterisk eXchange Version 2

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes IAX, the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol, an
   application-layer control and media protocol for creating, modifying,
   and terminating multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP)
   networks.  IAX was developed by the open source community for the
   Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is targeted primarily at
   Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used
   with streaming video or any other type of multimedia.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX is an "all in one" protocol for handling multimedia in IP
   networks.  It combines both control and media services in the same
   protocol.  In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static
   port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway
   traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around
   NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management.  IAX employs a
   compact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited
   for Internet telephony service.  In addition, its open nature permits
   new payload type additions needed to support additional services.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Numerous protocols have been specified by the Internet community to
   support control or signaling of multimedia sessions, for instance,
   SIP [RFC3261], Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) [RFC3435], and
   MEGACO/H.248 [RFC3525] (which has been obsoleted and made historic by
   [RFC5125]).  In general, these protocols are designed to offer full
   support for many types of media transmission.  This flexible approach
   adds some overhead to the protocol headers, but allows for the
   protocol use well beyond the current application.  Typically, these
   protocols reference, but do not specify, the media transmission
   protocol used to carry the actual stream.  SIP commonly uses Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to specify Real-Time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] streams.  This method allows for great
   flexibility, but again leads to more overhead.  Furthermore,
   multimedia solutions that use different, perhaps dynamic, network
   addresses for signaling and media transmission frequently suffer from
   Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal and security challenges.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX is the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol, which facilitates VoIP
   connections between servers, and between servers and clients that
   also use the IAX protocol.  IAX was created through an open source
   methodology rather than through a traditional, standards-based
   methodology.  It is an open protocol originally used by Asterisk, a
   dual-licensed open source and commercial PBX server from Digium.
   Independent IAX implementations may be open, proprietary, or licensed
   in anyway the author seems fit without royalty to the protocol
   creators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Basic Properties</h3></a>

   IAX is a robust and full-featured, yet, simple protocol.  It is
   general enough that it can handle most common types of media streams.
   However, the protocol is highly optimized for VoIP calls where low-
   overhead and low-bandwidth consumption are priorities.  This
   pragmatic aspect makes IAX more efficient for VoIP than protocols
   that consider possibilities far beyond current needs and specify many
   more details than are strictly necessary to describe or transport a
   point-to-point call.  Furthermore, because IAX is designed to be
   lightweight and VoIP-friendly, it consumes less bandwidth than more
   general approaches.  IAX is a binary protocol, designed to reduce
   overhead, especially in regards to voice streams.  Bandwidth
   efficiency, in some places, is sacrificed in exchange for bandwidth
   efficiency for individual voice calls.  For example, when
   transmitting a voice stream compressed to 8 kbit/s with a 20 ms
   packetization, each data packet consists of 20 bytes.  IAX adds 20%
   overhead, 4 bytes, on the majority of voice packets while RTP adds
   60% overhead with 12 additional bytes per voice packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to efficiency, IAX's single static UDP port approach
   makes IAX traffic easy for network managers to shape, prioritize, and
   pass through firewalls.  IAX's basic structure is that it multiplexes
   signaling and multiple media streams over a single UDP stream between
   two computers.  IAX also uses the same UDP port for both its
   signaling and media messages, and because all communications
   regarding a call are done over a the same point-to-point path, NAT
   traversal is much simpler for IAX than for other commonly deployed
   protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Drawbacks</h3></a>

   While IAX is very effective, addressing many of today's
   communications needs, it does have a few limitations.  For instance,
   IAX uses a point-to-point codec negotiation mechanism that limits
   extensibility because every IAX node in a call path must support
   every used codec to some degree.  In addition, the codec definition
   is controlled by an internally defined 32-bit mask, so the codecs
   must be defined in the protocol, and the maximum number of
   simultaneous codecs is, therefore, limited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One of IAX's design strengths also presents a potential problem.  The
   use of a single, well-known, port makes the protocol an easier target
   for denial-of-service attacks.  Real-time systems like VoIP are
   particularly sensitive to these attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The protocol is typically deployed with all signaling and media going
   to a centralized server.  While this combined path approach provides
   a great deal of control, it limits the overall system scalability.
   IAX now provides the ability to split the media from the signaling
   stream, which overcomes this limitation of earlier IAX versions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Most IAX drawbacks are due to implementation issues rather than
   protocol issues.  Threading presents a series of problems.  Many
   implementations have a limited number of threads available to process
   IAX traffic and can become overwhelmed by high use or denial-of-
   service attacks.  Newer implementations have additional controls to
   minimize the impact of these challenges.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Peer:  A host or device that implements the IAX protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Call:  A call is a relationship between two or more parties (i.e.,
      resources such as devices, user agents, or programs) that exists
      for some time for the purpose of exchanging real-time media.  In
      the context of this document, a call is an end-to-end relationship
      where at least the one leg of call path is implemented using the
      IAX protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Calling Party:  A device or program that initiates a call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Called Party:  A device or program to which a call is directed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Context:  A context is a named partition of a Dialplan.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Dialplan:  A Dialplan is a set of rules for associating provided
      names and numbers with a particular called party.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Frame:  The atomic communication unit between two IAX peers.  All IAX
      messages are carried within frames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information Element (IE):  A discrete data unit appended to an IAX
      frame that specifies user- or call-specific data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Registrant:  A registrant is a peer that makes REGISTER requests in
      order to advertise the address of a resource, i.e., a device or
      program to which a call may be directed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Registrar:  A registrar is a peer that processes REGISTER requests
      and places the information it receives in those requests into the
      location service.  [RFC3261].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview of IAX Protocol</h2></a>

   IAX is a peer-to-peer, VoIP-oriented protocol.  IAX includes both
   control and media functions.  It can register locations, create,
   modify, terminate multimedia sessions, and carry the actual media
   streams specified by the sessions it manages.  The protocol is
   designed and optimized for describing and transporting multimedia
   calls using Internet Protocol.  This document describes Version 2 of
   IAX; Version 1, although somewhat similar in design, utilized a
   different port and was not widely deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The basic design approach for IAX multiplexes signaling and multiple
   media streams over a single UDP association between two hosts.  This
   is accomplished by using the same "well-known" UDP port, 4569, for
   all types of IAX traffic.  IAX's unified signaling and media paths
   achieve NAT transparency, which is an advantage of IAX over
   alternative media transport protocols such as SIP [RFC3261].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX is coded as a binary protocol.  One major benefit of using a
   binary protocol is bandwidth efficiency because the quality of voice
   calls is frequently related to the amount of bandwidth consumed.
   This is one way the protocol is specifically optimized to make
   efficient use of bandwidth for individual voice calls.  The bandwidth
   efficiency for other stream types is sacrificed for the sake of
   individual voice calls.  Other benefits of a binary protocol are
   robustness against buffer-overrun attacks, and compact implementation
   capability, which reduces interoperability issues related to parsing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The atomic communication unit in IAX is the "Frame".  There are
   multiple classes of Frames, each of which is described below.  In
   general, "Full Frames" carry signaling/control data, while "Mini
   Frames" carry media stream data.  Full Frames enclose optional
   'Information Elements' (IEs).  IEs describe various types of user- or
   call-specific data.  "Meta Frames" are used for call trunking or
   video stream transmission.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An IAX-based call may consist of many call legs, or segments.  Each
   call leg may be implemented using different protocols, e.g., SIP to
   IAX to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network).  IAX is
   responsible for setting up one or more legs of a complete call path,
   not necessarily the end-to-end call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX is an optimized peer-to-peer protocol.  If two adjacent call legs
   utilize the IAX protocol and if the intermediate peer determines that
   it does not need to remain in the call path, it can supervise a
   calling path change such that it removes itself from the path.  This
   supervision is complete, a call path is not changed until all peers
   in the optimized call path confirm they can properly communicate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX supports security features by allowing multiple methods of user
   authentication and authorization, as well as allowing multiple
   security methods for peer registration.  IAX also specifies a generic
   framework for native encryption.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Naming Conventions</h2></a>

   Call Identifier:  A call leg is marked with two unique integers, one
      assigned by each peer involved in creating the call leg.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Number:  The Calling and Called Numbers are a set of digits and
      letters identifying a call originator and the desired terminating
      resource.  The term 'Number' is historic and has been expanded to
      include letters.  A peer is responsible for defining its own
      dialplan.  A peer MAY define its dialplan according to ITU-T
      Recommendation E.164 [E164].  However, this is not required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Username:  A username is a string used for identification purposes.

      initiate an IAX-based call with that resource.
      IAX URIs are associated with server resources to which calls may
      be routed.  For instance, an IAX URI may represent an appearance

	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   URI Comparison</h3></a>

   Some operations in this specification require determining whether two
   IAX URIs are equivalent.  IAX URIs are compared for equality
   according to the following rules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All components of the URI MUST be identical except:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The port, if omitted, is considered to be the same as the default,
      4569.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      All URI components, except the username field, are case
      insensitive, and MUST be normalized to lower case as per Section
      6.2.2.1 of [RFC3986] before comparison.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The URIs within each of the following sets are equivalent:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   iax:atlanta.com/alice
   iax:AtLaNtA.com/ALicE
   iax:atlanta.com:4569/alice

   iax:alice@atlanta.com/alice
   iax:alice@AtLaNtA.com:4569/ALicE

   The URIs within the following set are not equivalent:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   iax:ALICE@atlanta.com/alice
   iax:alice@atlanta.com/alice

   NOTE: A host in domain form and in IP address form are NOT considered
   identical even if the host name resolves to an address record that
   matches the given IP address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Peer Behavior and Related Messages</h2></a>

   Messages are divided into two categories: reliable and non-
   guaranteed.  The reliable messages are referred to as "Full Frames".
   In addition to a message type indicator and facilities to ensure
   reliability, see Section 7, they include the full call identifier.
   It consists of each of peer's identifiers for the call.  Additional
   attributes, "Information Elements" or "IEs", may be associated with
   the Full Frame messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The non-guaranteed messages are referred to as "Mini-Frames" and
   "Meta Frames" and these more compact messages only have the
   originating peer's call identifier and MUST NOT have any "Information
   Elements".
   Peer behavior is presented in several partitions divided by the
   following functional areas:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Registration (OPTIONAL)

      Call Link Management

      Call Path Optimization (OPTIONAL)

      Mid-Call Behavior

      Call Tear Down

      Network Monitoring

      Digit Dialing (OPTIONAL)

      Miscellaneous

      Media Messages

   Each of these behavior topics and the messages involved are described
   in the sections that follow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Registration (OPTIONAL)</h3></a>

	<a name="section-6.1.1"><h4>6.1.1   Overview</h4></a>

   In order for one IAX peer to be reachable by another IAX peer, the
   calling peer needs the network address of the receiving peer.  This
   address may be manually provisioned, determined through a shared
   directory, e.g. an ENUM-like service, [RFC3761] or configured using
   the IAX protocol.  IAX provides a facility for one peer to register
   its address and credentials with another so that callers can reach
   the registrant.  The IAX registration facility is optional.  If
   implemented, the IAX registration protocol MAY be done in parts,
   e.g., an analog telephone adapter MAY only implement the registrant
   portion of the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX allows user authentication via multiple methods.  MD5 Message-
   Digest authentication [RFC1321] uses an MD5 sum arrangement, but
   still requires that both ends have plaintext access to the secret.
   (See Section 8.6.15.)  Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman's (RSA) algorithm
   [RFC3447] allows unidirectional secret knowledge through public/
   private key pairs.  IAX Private keys SHOULD always be Triple Data
   Encryption Standard (3DES) encrypted [RFC1851].  (See
   Section 8.6.16.)

                    Figure 1: Registrant State Diagram

   Registration, illustrated in Figure 1, is performed by a registrant
   that sends a username and a registration 'refresh' period to the
   registrar.  This is accomplished with a REGREQ message.  If
   authentication is required, the registrar responds with the REGAUTH
   message that indicates the types of authentication supported by the
   registrar.  In response, the registrant resends a REGREQ with one of
   the supported authentications.  If the registrant cannot
   authenticate, no further action is necessary.  If accepted, the
   registrar sends a REGACK message, which MUST indicate the 'apparent
   address' and SHOULD indicate the 'refresh'/expire time.  If no
   'refresh' is sent, a default registration expiration of 60 seconds
   MUST be assumed by both peers.  At any time during this exchange, the
   registrar may send a REGREJ message to indicate a failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A registration has a specified time period associated with it for
   which it is valid.  This time period begins when the registrar sends
   a REGACK message.  A registrant may extend that time period by
   repeating the registration process.  A registrant MAY also force an
   expiration in the registrar by sending the REGREL message.  This
   message may be challenged with REGAUTH or, if sufficient credentials
   were included, it will be accepted with REGACK.  In response to a
   REGAUTH, a REGREL message SHOULD be resent using the specified
   credentials.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   See Sections 9.3 and 9.4 for example call flows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.2"><h4>6.1.2   REGREQ Registration Request Message</h4></a>

   The REGREQ occurs independently of any media-carrying call.  A REGREQ
   MUST include the 'username' IE and SHOULD include the 'refresh' IE.
   A REGREQ is used both for an initial registration request as well as
   for a reply to a REGAUTH.  As a reply to a REGAUTH message, it MUST
   include credentials such as a response to a REGAUTH's challenge.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of a REGREQ message that has credentials, a registrar
   MUST determine their validity.  If valid, it MUST respond with a
   REGACK message indicating the time period for which this registration
   is valid.  If the provided credentials are not valid or the registrar
   cannot validate the credentials, the registrar MUST respond with a
   REGREJ message.  If credentials are not provided, the registrar MUST
   respond with a REGAUTH message that indicates the available
   authentication methods.

	<a name="section-6.2.1"><h4>6.2.1   Overview</h4></a>

   The IAX protocol can be used to set up 'links' or 'call legs' between
   two peers for the purposes of placing a call.  The process,
   illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3, starts when a peer sends a NEW
   message indicating the destination 'number' (or name) of a Called
   Party on the remote peer.  The remote peer can respond with either a
   credentials challenge (AUTHREQ), a REJECT message, or an ACCEPT
   message.  The AUTHREQ message indicates the permitted authentication
   schemes and SHOULD result in the sending of an AUTHREP message with
   the requested credentials.  The REJECT message indicates the call
   cannot be established at this time.  ACCEPT indicates that the call
   leg between these two peers is established and that higher-level call
   signaling (Section 6.3) MAY proceed.  After sending or receiving the
   ACCEPT message, the call leg is in the 'Linked' state and is used to
   pass call control messages until the call is completed.  Further
   detail on messages used for this process can be found in Section 6.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Call legs are labeled with a pair of identifiers.  Each end of the
   call leg assigns the source or destination identifier during the call
   leg creation process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.2"><h4>6.2.2   NEW Request Message</h4></a>

   A NEW message is sent to initiate a call.  It is the first call-
   specific message sent to initiate an actual media exchange between
   two peers.  'NEW' messages are unique compared to other Call
   Supervision messages in that they do not require a destination call
   identifier in their header.  This absence is because the remote
   peer's source call identifier is not created until after receipt of
   this frame.  Before sending a NEW message, the local IAX peer MUST
   assign a source call identifier that is not currently being used for
   another call.  A time-stamp MUST also be assigned for the call,
   beginning at zero and incrementing by one each millisecond.  Sequence
   numbers for a NEW message, described in the transport section,
   (Section 7) are both set to 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A NEW message MUST include the 'version' IE, and it MUST be the first
   IE; the order of other IEs is unspecified.  A NEW SHOULD generally
   include IEs to indicate routing on the remote peer, e.g., via the
   'called number' IE or to indicate a peer partition or ruleset, the
   'called context' IE.  Caller identification and CODEC negotiation IEs
   MAY also be included.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of a NEW message, the receiving peer examines the
   destination and MUST perform one of the following actions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Send a REJECT response,

      Challenge the caller with an AUTHREQ response,

      Accept the call using an ACCEPT message, or

      Abort the connection using a HANGUP message, although the REJECT
      message is preferred at this point in call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the call is accepted, the peer MUST progress the call and further
   respond with one of PROCEEDING, RINGING, BUSY, or ANSWER depending on
   the status of the called party on the peer.  See Section 6.3 for
   further details.

	<a name="section-6.2.3"><h4>6.2.3   ACCEPT Response Message</h4></a>

   An ACCEPT response is issued when a NEW message is received, and
   authentication has taken place (if required).  It acknowledges
   receipt of a NEW message and indicates that the call leg has been set
   up on the terminating side, including assigning a CODEC.  An ACCEPT
   message MUST include the 'format' IE to indicate its desired CODEC to
   the originating peer.  The CODEC format MUST be one of the formats
   sent in the associated NEW command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of an ACCEPT, an ACK MUST be sent and the CODEC for the
   call MAY be configured using the 'format' IE from the received
   ACCEPT.  The call then waits for an ANSWER, HANGUP, or other call
   control signal.  (See Section 6.3.)  If a subsequent ACCEPT message
   is received for a call that has already started, or has not sent a
   NEW message, the message MUST be ignored.

	<a name="section-6.2.4"><h4>6.2.4   REJECT Response Message</h4></a>

   A REJECT response is sent to indicate that a NEW, AUTHREP, DIAL, or
   ACCEPT request has been denied.  It MAY be due to an authentication
   failure, an invalid username, or if a peer cannot provide a valid
   password or response to an issued challenge.  It MAY also be used to
   notify a peer of a call setup failure, e.g., when IAX peers cannot
   negotiate a CODEC to use.  Upon receipt of a REJECT message, the call
   leg is destroyed and no further action is required.  (Note: REJECT
   messages require an explicit ACK.)

   REJECT messages MAY include the 'causecode' and 'cause' IEs to
   indicate the rejection reason.

   A HANGUP message is sent by either peer and indicates a call tear-

   reason for terminating the call.  Upon receipt of a HANGUP message,
   an IAX peer MUST immediately respond with an ACK, and then destroy
   the call leg at its end.  After a HANGUP message has been received
   for a call leg, any messages received that reference that call leg
   (i.e., have the same source/destination call identifiers) MUST be
   answered with an INVAL message.  This indicates that the received
   message is invalid because the call no longer exists.

	<a name="section-6.3.1"><h4>6.3.1   Overview</h4></a>

   IAX's call control messages provide end-to-end signaling functions
   common to other telephony control protocols.  The messages include
   RINGING, ANSWER, BUSY, and PROCEEDING.  These messages MUST only be
   sent after an IAX call leg has been ACCEPTed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In response to an exchange starting with a NEW message, typically,
   the first call control message is RINGING; however, a PROCEEDING
   message MAY precede it or the call MAY proceed directly to the ANSWER
   message.  If the call is answered, an ANSWER message will be sent.
   Other possibilities include a "BUSY" indication, or if the called
   party's service cannot be reached, the call will be torn down using
   the link-level HANGUP and an appropriate cause code.
   If the link was started with a DIAL message, the sequence is an
   optional PROCEEDING, then optional RINGING, then ANSWER or BUSY.  Of
   course, a link level HANGUP MAY occur at any time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Various private extensions to IAX Control messages have been deployed
   for passing application-specific data over the IAX control link.  One
   such extension is an application that controls ham radio
   transceivers.  An IAX peer that receives a control message that is
   not understood MUST respond with the UNSUPPORT message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mandatory IAX control messages are explained below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.2"><h4>6.3.2   PROCEEDING Response Message</h4></a>

   The PROCEEDING message SHOULD be sent to a calling party when their
   call request is being processed by a further network element but has
   not yet reached the called party.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of a PROCEEDING message, the peer SHOULD perform
   protocol-specific actions to indicate this fact to the calling party,
   e.g., tones, an ISUP (ISDN User Part) Proceeding message, etc.  If
   the prior call leg is utilizing the IAX protocol, a PROCEEDING
   message MUST be sent to that peer.  The processing of this message at
   an originating or transcoding peer is not specified; however, if
   possible, the status may be displayed to the calling party.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PROCEEDING message does not require any IEs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.3"><h4>6.3.3   RINGING Response Message</h4></a>

   This message is sent from a terminating party to indicate that the
   called party's service has processed the call request and is being
   alerted to the call.  An IAX RINGING message MUST be sent to an IAX-
   based calling party when the peer determines that the called party is
   being alerted, e.g., when their phone is ringing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of an IAX RINGING message, the peer MUST pass this
   indication to the calling party, unless the calling party has already
   received such indication.  For an initiating peer, this is typically
   done by starting the ring-back tone; however, many implementations
   start ring-back before ringing in order to meet user expectations.
   If the calling party is using the IAX protocol, a RINGING message
   MUST be passed to this caller.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RINGING message does not require any IEs.
	<a name="section-6.3.4"><h4>6.3.4   ANSWER Response Message</h4></a>

   This message is sent from the called party to indicate that the party
   has accepted the call request and is communicating with the calling
   party.  Upon receipt of this message, any ring-back or other progress
   tones MUST be terminated and the communications channel MUST be
   opened.

   If a peer is handling a call between two other IAX peers and the peer
   no longer has any need to monitor the progress, content, or duration
   of the call, it MAY remove itself from the call by directing the
   other two peers to communicate directly.  This call path
   optimization, or "supervised transfer", is done in a manner that
   ensures the call will not be lost in the process; the initiating peer
   does not give up control of the process until it has confirmed the
   other two peers are communicating.  Note: the parties involved in the
   call are not aware of this operation; it is purely a network
   operation.

   When a peer initiates this procedure, both call legs MUST be in the
   UP state, i.e., they MUST have sent or received the ACCEPT message
   for that call leg.  To start, it sends a TXREQ message with the
   addresses and information from the other remote peers to each its
   neighbors.  If capable of performing this procedure, they begin
   transmitting all channel information to both the initiating peer and
   the new remote peer.  They also send a TXCNT message indicating
   packet counts for the call leg to the new remote peer.  Each TXCNT
   message is acknowledged with a TXACC message.  The peers respond by
   sending a TXREADY message to the initiator indicating that they have
   confirmed the new communications path.  When all remote peers have
   sent the initiator a TXREADY message, the transfer is successful and
   the initiator responds with a TXREL and has finished its involvement
   with the call.  If during the transfer process, the two remote peers
   cannot communicate, they send a TXREJ message to the initiator.  An
   example is shown in Section 9.5.

   An ACK acknowledges the receipt of an IAX message.  An ACK is sent
   upon receipt of a Full Frame that does not have any other protocol-
   defined response.  An ACK MUST have both a source call number and
   destination call number.  It MUST also not change the sequence number

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An ACK MAY also be sent as an initial acknowledgment of an IAX
   message that requires some other protocol-defined message
   acknowledgment, as long as the required message is also sent within

   The IAX protocol supports many types of media and these are
   transported through the same UDP port as other IAX messages.  Voice
   and video are unique in that they utilize two different encodings,
   each with different support procedures.  Abbreviated 'Mini Frames'
   are normally used for audio and video; however, each time the time-
   stamp is a multiple of 32,768 (0x8000 hex), a standard or 'Full
   Frame' MUST be sent.  This approach facilitates efficiency and
   reliability by sending compressed packets, without guaranteed
   delivery, most of the time while periodically forcing reliable
   exchanges with the peer.  If communication fails, call tear-down
   procedures are invoked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receiving any media message, except the abbreviated audio and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Message Transport</h2></a>

   IAX is sent over UDP and uses an application-level protocol to
   provide reliable transport where needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With respect to transport, there are two message formats: reliable or
   'Full Frames' and unacknowledged 'Mini' or 'Meta' frames.  All
   messages except certain voice and video messages are reliable.
   Reliable messages are transported by a scheme that maintains message
   counts and time-stamps for both peers involved in the call.  The
   counts are per call.  Each peer maintains a timer for all reliable
   messages and MUST periodically retransmit those messages until they
   acknowledge or the retry limit is exceeded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When starting a call, the outgoing and incoming message sequence
   numbers MUST both be set to zero.  Each reliable message that is sent
   increments the message count by one except the ACK, INVAL, TXCNT,
   TXACC, and VNAK messages, which do not change the message count.  The
   message includes the outgoing message count and the highest numbered
   incoming message that has been received.  In addition, it contains a
   time-stamp that represents the number of milliseconds since the call
   started.  Or, in the case of certain network timing messages, it
   contains a copy of the time-stamp sent to it.  Time-stamps MAY be
   approximate, but, MUST be in order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When any message is received, the time-stamps MUST be checked to make
   sure that they are in order.  If a message is received out of order,
   it MUST be ignored and a VNAK message sent to resynchronize the
   peers.  If the message is a reliable message, the incoming message
   counter MUST be used to acknowledge all the messages up to that
   sequence number that have been sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If no acknowledgment is received after a locally configured number of
   retries (default 4), the call leg SHOULD be considered unusable and
   the call MUST be torn down without any further interaction on this
   call leg.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   Trunking</h3></a>

   IAX allows multiple media exchanges between the same two peers to be
   multiplexed into a single trunk call coalescing media payload into a
   combined packet.  This decreases bandwidth usage as there are fewer
   total packets being transmitted.  Trunking MAY occur in one or both
   directions of an IAX exchange.  A trunk consists of a trunk header
   and one or more trunked IAX calls.  The trunk message contains a
   time-stamp specifying the time of transmission of the trunk frame.
   The audio data from the trunked calls are encapsulated in the trunk
   frame following the header.  Each trunked call consists of two octets
   specifying the call's source number, two octets specifying the length
   in octets of the media data, and the media data itself.  IAX permits
   transmitting the time-stamps of each encapsulated Mini Frame as well,
   so that accurate timing information can be used for jitter buffers,
   etc.  A flag in the meta command header specifies whether the
   encapsulated Mini Frames retain their original time-stamps.  If they
   do not retain them, they MUST assume the time-stamp in the trunk
   header upon being received by the trunk peer.
	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   Timers</h3></a>

   There are various timers in the IAX protocol.  There are other
   application-level timers, such as the call timer and ring timer, that
   are beyond the scope of this document.  This section describes the
   IAX timers and specifies their default values and behaviors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.1"><h4>7.2.1   Retransmission Timer</h4></a>

   The message retransmission procedures are described in Section 7.  On
   each call, there is a timer for how long to wait for an
   acknowledgment of a message.  This timer starts at twice the measured
   Round-Trip Time from the last PING/PONG command.  If a retransmission
   is needed, it is exponentially increased until it meets a boundary
   value.  The maximum retry time period boundary is 10 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.2"><h4>7.2.2   Registration Period Timer</h4></a>

   Registrations are valid for a specified time period.  It is the
   client's responsibility to renew this registration before the time
   period expires.  The registrations SHOULD be renewed at random
   intervals to prevent network congestion.  A registrar MUST monitor
   this time period and invalidate the registration if the client/
   registrant has not renewed their registration before the timer
   elapses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3   NAT Considerations</h3></a>

   IAX is very well suited to operating behind NAT due to its single
   port approach.  This approach eliminates any start of call media
   stream delays while the NAT gateway establishes a bidirectional port
   association.  Deploying a single IAX server behind a NAT gateway
   requires little effort.  If the server acts as a registrar, the IAX
   UDP port on the NAT gateway must be forwarded to the server.  If the
   server acts as a registrant, the default, 60 second, REGREQ refresh
   timer should be sufficient to maintain a port association in the NAT
   gateway; however, a static port mapping is preferred.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If multiple servers are to be deployed behind a single NAT gateway,
   most NAT gateways require each IAX server to use different UDP ports.
   Of course, there may be NAT implementations that recognize when
   multiple devices utilize the same private port and manage it
   appropriately.
	<a name="section-7.4"><h3>7.4   Encryption</h3></a>

   IAX supports call encryption using the symmetric key, Rijndael [AES]
   block cipher (also called AES -- Advanced Encryption Standard).
   Rijndael is a 128-bit block cipher utilizing a shared secret.  IAX
   encrypts on a call-by-call basis starting with a plaintext NEW
   message indicating, in addition to the other message parameters, that
   the call should be encrypted.  This indication is given by sending
   the ENCRYPTION IE (Section 8.6.34) in the NEW request message.  If
   the called host supports encryption, it will respond with a plaintext
   AUTHREQ message that also includes the ENCRYPTION IE.  All subsequent
   messages in the call MUST be encrypted.  If the called host does not
   support encryption, the AUTHREQ sent in response to the NEW must not
   include the ENCRYPTION IE and the calling host MUST either HANGUP the
   request or continue with the unencrypted call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key to use in encrypting the messages is computed by taking the
   CHALLENGE IE Section 8.6.14 from the AUTHREQ and concatenating any
   one of the shared passwords then computing the 128-bit MD5 digest of
   this combination.  To decrypt, if there is more than one password for
   the peer, each must be tried until the message is successfully
   decoded.  The key remains constant for the duration of the call.
   Only the data portion of the messages are encoded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Message Encoding</h2></a>

	<a name="section-8.1"><h3>8.1   Frame Structure</h3></a>

   This section contains the specification for each type of frame that
   IAX defines.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.1.1"><h4>8.1.1   Full Frames</h4></a>

   Full Frames can send signaling or media data.  Generally, Full Frames
   are used to control initiation, setup, and termination of an IAX
   call, but they can also be used to carry stream data (though this is
   generally not optimal).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Full Frames are sent reliably, so all Full Frames require an
   immediate acknowledgment upon receipt.  This acknowledgment can be
   explicit via an 'ACK' message (see Section 8.4) or implicit based
   upon receipt of an appropriate response to the Full Frame issued.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The standard Full Frame header length is 12 octets.
   Field descriptions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'F' bit

      This bit specifies whether or not the frame is a Full Frame.  If
      the 'F' bit is set to 1, the frame is a Full Frame.  If it is set
      to 0, it is not a Full Frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Source call number

      This 15-bit value specifies the call number the transmitting
      client uses to identify this call.  The source call number for an
      active call MUST NOT be in use by another call on the same client.
      Call numbers MAY be reused once a call is no longer active, i.e.,
      either when there is positive acknowledgment that the call has
      been destroyed or when all possible timeouts for the call have
      expired.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'R' bit

      This bit specifies whether or not the frame is being
      retransmitted.  If the 'R' bit is set to 0, the frame is being
      transmitted for the first time.  If it is set to 1, the frame is
      being retransmitted.  IAX does not specify a retransmit timeout;
      this is left to the implementor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Destination call number

      This 15-bit value specifies the call number the transmitting
      client uses to reference the call at the remote peer.  This number
      is the same as the remote peer's source call number.  The
      destination call number uniquely identifies a call on the remote
      peer.  The source call number uniquely identifies the call on the
      local peer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Time-stamp

      The time-stamp field contains a 32-bit time-stamp maintained by an
      IAX peer for a given call.  The time-stamp is an incrementally
      increasing representation of the number of milliseconds since the
      first transmission of the call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OSeqno

      The 8-bit OSeqno field is the outbound stream sequence number.
      Upon initialization of a call, its value is 0.  It increases
      incrementally as Full Frames are sent.  When the counter
      overflows, it silently resets to 0.
   ISeqno

      The 8-bit ISeqno field is the inbound stream sequence number.
      Upon initialization of a call, its value is 0.  It increases
      incrementally as Full Frames are received.  At any time, the
      ISeqno of a call represents the next expected inbound stream
      sequence number.  When the counter overflows, it silently resets
      to 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Frametype

      The Frametype field identifies the type of message carried by the
      frame.  See Section 8.2 for more information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'C' bit

      This bit determines how the remaining 7 bits of the Subclass field
      are coded.  If the 'C' bit is set to 1, the Subclass value is
      interpreted as a power of 2.  If it is not set, the Subclass value
      is interpreted as a simple 7-bit unsigned integer.

   Mini Frames are so named because their header is a minimal 4 octets.
   Mini Frames carry no control or signaling data; their sole purpose is
   to carry a media stream on an already-established IAX call.  They are
   sent unreliably.  This decision was made because VoIP calls typically
   can miss several frames without significant degradation in call
   quality while the incurred overhead in ensuring reliability increases
   bandwidth requirements and decreases throughput.  Further, because
   voice calls are typically sent in real time, lost frames are too old
   to be reintegrated into the audio stream by the time they can be
   retransmitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Field descriptions:

      Mini frames carry a 16-bit time-stamp, which is the lower 16 bits
      of the transmitting peer's full 32-bit time-stamp for the call.
      The time-stamp allows synchronization of incoming frames so that
      they MAY be processed in chronological order instead of the
      (possibly different) order in which they are received.  The 16-bit
      time-stamp wraps after 65.536 seconds, at which point a full frame
      SHOULD be sent to notify the remote peer that its time-stamp has
      been reset.  A call MUST continue to send mini frames starting
      with time-stamp 0 even if acknowledgment of the resynchronization
      is not received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The F bit, source call number, and 16-bit time-stamp comprise the

   Meta frames serve one of two purposes.  Meta video frames allow the
   transmission of video streams with an optimized header.  They are
   similar in purpose to mini voice frames.  Meta trunk frames are used
   for trunking multiple IAX media streams between two peers into one
   header, to further minimize bandwidth consumption.

   IAX natively supports two methods of trunking multiple media streams
   between two peers into a single association.  The first method sends
   a standard meta header, along with a single 32-bit time-stamp
   describing the transmission time of the trunk frame.  Following the
   time-stamp are one or more media frames consisting of the call number
   and the length in octets of the stream data included in the frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second method of trunking is very similar to the first.  It sends
   a standard meta header, including the 32-bit time-stamp describing
   the time of transmission of the trunk frame.  But the media frames
   included in the trunk are actually complete Mini Frames, including
   the 16-bit time-stamp for each call.  The first method uses slightly
   less bandwidth (2 fewer octets per call in the trunk), while the
   second method maintains the individual time-stamps for each call so
   that jitter buffering can use the actual time-stamps associated with
   a call instead of the (less accurate) time-stamp representing the
   entire trunk.  Either method is permissible for trunking.
   Field descriptions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'F' bit

      Meta trunk frames MUST have the 'F' bit set to 0 to indicate that
      they are not Full Frames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Meta Indicator

      The meta indicator is a 15-bit field of all zeroes, used to
      indicate that the frame is a Meta Frame.  Meta Frames are
      identifiable because the first 16 bits will always be zero in any
      Meta Frame, whereas Full or Mini Frames will have either the 'F'
      bit set or some (nonzero) value for the source call number (or
      both).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   'V' bit

      The 'V' bit in a meta trunk frame is set to 0 to specify that the
      frame is not a meta video frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Meta Command

      This 7-bit field identifies whether or not the Meta Frame is a
      trunk.  A value of '1' indicates that the frame is a meta trunk
      frame.  All other values are reserved for future use.  See the
      IANA Registry for additional IAX Meta Command Assignments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Command Data

      This 8-bit field specifies flags for options that apply to a
      trunked call.  The least significant bit of the field is the
      'trunk time-stamps' flag.  A value of 0 indicates that the calls
      in the trunk do not include their individual time-stamps.  A value
      of 1 indicates that the calls do each include their own time-
      stamp.  All other bits are reserved for future use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   time-stamp

      Meta trunk frames carry a 32-bit time-stamp, which represents the
      actual time of transmission of the trunk frame.  This is distinct
      from the time-stamps of the calls included in the trunk.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following the 32-bit time-stamp is one or more trunked calls.  If the
   'trunk time-stamps' flag is set to 0, each entry consists of 2 octets
   specifying the source call number of the call, 2 octets specifying
   the length in octets of the media data, and then the media data.  If
   the 'trunk time-stamps' flag is set to 1, each entry consists of 2
   octets specifying the length in octets of the media data, and then a
   Mini Frame (2 octets specifying source call number, 2 octets
   specifying 16-bit time-stamp, and the media data).  The following two

   Since AES requires a 16 byte block size, some padding is essential.
   This padding has been placed at the beginning of the payload because
   it makes it more difficult to take advantage of the predictability of
   the IAX frame header.  For example, the first encrypted Frame an IAX
   client sends within an incoming IAX call is entirely predictable: It
   is always an ACK - where even the time-stamp is guessable as it is
   the time the AUTHREP packet was sent.

	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   Frame Types</h3></a>

   The IAX protocol specifies 10 types of possible frames for the
   "frametype" field of a Full Frame.  They are described in the
   following subsections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.1"><h4>8.2.1   DTMF Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries a single digit of DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency).
   More information about DTMF can be found in RFC 4733 [RFC4733] and
   [RFC4734].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For DTMF frames, the subclass is the actual DTMF digit carried by the
   frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.2"><h4>8.2.2   Voice Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries voice data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subclass specifies the audio format of the data.  Predefined
   voice formats can be found in Section 8.7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.3"><h4>8.2.3   Video Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries video data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subclass specifies the video format of the data.  Predefined
   video formats can be found in Section 8.7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.4"><h4>8.2.4   Control Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries session control data, i.e., it refers to control of
   a device connected to an IAX endpoint.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subclass is a value from Section 8.3 describing the device
   control signal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.5"><h4>8.2.5   Null Frame</h4></a>

   Frames with the Null value MUST NOT be transmitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.6"><h4>8.2.6   IAX Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries control data that provides IAX protocol-specific
   endpoint management.  This frametype is used to manage IAX protocol
   interactions that are generally independent of the type of endpoints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subclass is a value from Section 8.4 describing an IAX event.
	<a name="section-8.2.7"><h4>8.2.7   Text Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries a non-control text message in UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All text frames have a subclass of 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.8"><h4>8.2.8   Image Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries a single image.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subclass describes the format of the image from Section 8.7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2.9"><h4>8.2.9   HTML Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries HTML data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subclass is a value from the HTML Subclasses table in
   Section 8.5.
	<a name="section-8.2.10"><h4>8.2.10   Comfort Noise Frame</h4></a>

   The frame carries comfort noise.

	<a name="section-8.4"><h3>8.4   IAX Frames</h3></a>

   Frames of type 'IAX' are used to provide management of IAX endpoints.
   They handle IAX signaling (e.g., call setup, maintenance, and tear-
   down).  They MAY also handle direct transmission of media data, but
   this is not optimal for VoIP calls.  They do not carry session-
   specific control (e.g., device state), as this is the purpose of
   Control Frames.  The IAX commands are listed and described below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.6"><h3>8.6   Information Elements</h3></a>

   IAX messages sent as Full Frames MAY carry information elements to
   specify user- or call-specific data.  Information elements are
   appended to a frame header in its data field.  Zero, one, or multiple
   information elements MAY be included with any IAX message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information elements are coded as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The first octet of any information element consists of the "IE"
      field.  The IE field is an identification number that defines the
      particular information element.  Table 1 lists the defined
      information elements and each information element is defined below
      the table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The second octet of any information element is the "data length"
      field.  It specifies the length in octets of the information
      element's data field.
      The remaining octet(s) of an information element contain the
      actual data being transmitted.  The representation of the data is
      dependent on the particular information element as identified by
      its "IE" field.  Some information elements carry binary data, some
      carry UTF-8 [RFC3629] data, and some have no data field at all.
      Elements that carry UTF-8 MUST prepare strings as per [RFC3454]
      and [RFC3491], so that illegal characters, case folding, and other
      characters properties are handled and compared properly.  The data
      representation for each information element is described below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following table specifies the Information Element Binary Format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                        1

   The purpose of the CALLED NUMBER information element is to indicate
   the number or extension being called.  It carries UTF-8-encoded data.
   The CALLED NUMBER information element MUST use UTF-8 encoding and not
   numeric data because destinations are not limited to E.164 numbers
   ([E164]), national numbers, or even digits.  It is possible for a
   number or extension to include non-numeric characters.  The CALLED
   NUMBER IE MAY contain a SIP URI, [RFC3261] or a URI in any other
   format.  The ability to serve a CALLED NUMBER is server dependent.

   the day of the month, the next least significant 4 bits are the
   month, and the most significant 7 bits are the year.  The year is
   offset from 2000, and the month is a 1-based index (i.e., January ==

   The purpose of the OSPTOKEN information element is to carry European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Technical Specification
   101 321 [OSP] (also referred to as the Open Settlement Protocol or
   OSP) tokens.  The OSP tokens will be used to provide authorization,
   authentication and account support for IAX by using the OSP protocol.
   The first octet of the data field is the OSP token block index
   starting from 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OSPTOKEN information element MAY only be sent with IAX NEW
   messages.  If the token is not supported by the receiver, it is
   ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   IAX is a binary protocol for setting up point-to-point call legs that
   include both media and signaling.  As such, it is simpler to secure
   than other more general purpose VoIP protocols; however, security
   remains a difficult task and various aspects of the protocol must be
   examined to identify risks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IAX registration is an area that requires careful attention.
   Previous protocol versions supported cleartext passwords; this
   feature has been eliminated.  The MD5 and RSA alternatives offer much
   higher security.  Although not specified by the IAX protocol, some
   implementations limit the number of registrants per account to one.
   A subsequent registrant with the same credentials would overwrite the
   prior and receive the calls destined for that user.  Theft of service
   is trivial once a malicious caller has the ability to authenticate.
   In addition, since distinct cause codes are returned to erroneous
   registration attempts, an attacker can distinguish between existent
   and nonexistent users in a registration system, thus resulting in a
   possible directory harvest attack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IAX protocol protects against message replay by using a challenge
   response method.  The IAX registrar or server challenges each call or
   registration with an arbitrary MD5 or RSA challenge.  The response
   and subsequent authorization relies upon knowledge of a shared
   secret.  Since the server typically chooses a challenges using a
   random-number-based technique, the challenge set is large, making
   replay highly unlikely.
   Although operation in the following manner is not recommended, the
   IAX protocol does permit servers to forego the challenge process
   described above.  This open approach is inherently insecure and does
   nothing to prevent unauthorized usage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Call Encryption in IAX starts by utilizing static keys.  Once
   negotiated, the key may be changed for the remainder of the call.
   Once the initial key is compromised, all subsequent calls are subject
   to interception.  A more secure implementation would update the key
   frequently and as early as practical during each call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IAX protocol is also susceptible to eavesdropping.  Call Detail,
   i.e., who is calling whom, is sent in unencrypted binary whether or
   not the call is to be encrypted.  Without encryption, call content,
   i.e., audio and video, may be easily intercepted.  However, this
   content is protected if the call is encrypted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Man-in-the-middle attacks are a threat to IAX if encryption is not
   used.  This form of attack permits message insertion, deletion, and
   modification such that a call may be redirected or the audio or video
   replaced in either or both directions for the complete or any portion
   of a call.  If encryption is used, the call is protected end to end.
   Note: an initial NEW message in an encrypted call is unencrypted and
   could be changed; however, this is limited to a denial-of-service
   (DoS) attack because subsequent messages containing the same address
   information are redelivered in an encrypted form.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DoS attacks can take at least two forms in IAX.  One is simply
   overloading the peers with bogus requests.  A carefully implemented
   IAX peer would identify this situation and raise an alarm or take
   other protective action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Another form of DoS against an existing call is an engineered attack
   against an existing call.  Injecting media, causing excess processing
   by inserting out-of-order packets, and sending commands such as
   hangup or transfer.  These attacks require close monitoring of the
   binary channel to be successful as the message sequence numbers would
   need to be synchronized with the protocol exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Of course, providing lower-layer security with Datagram Transport
   Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4347], or IPsec [RFC4301], would address
   many of these potential issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unicode [RFC3629] and stringprep [RFC3454] security considerations
   also apply.
	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   In order to facilitate the orderly extension of the IAX protocol,
   several IANA registries have been created.  These registry requests
   are found in [RFC5457].  In addition, the "iax" URI scheme has been
   registered; see Section 5.  Also, IAX has been assigned a well-known
   UDP port number (4569).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12"><h2>12.   Implementation Notes</h2></a>

   The original IAX implementation was in Asterisk, the open-source PBX,
   but [wikipedia] lists thirteen other publicly available
   implementations at the time of this writing.  Some of these
   implementations used draft versions of this specification.  Many
   others were developed using the Asterisk source code as the only
   specification.  While this approach is definitive, it is very
   difficult to determine the protocol's higher-level logic and optimize
   it for the particular programming language or application
   environment.  Interoperability of these implementations cannot be
   guaranteed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Aside from the trials and tribulations of reverse engineering the
   source code to create a new implementation, the key lessons learned
   involve the use of threads, support of international character sets,
   security, and improved controls to limit interference during DoS
   attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The current Asterisk implementation has a limited number of IAX
   worker threads and, as a result, its scalability is limited, but it
   can run on low end machines where threads may not be freely
   available.  Improving the threading model will undoubtedly improve
   performance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Internationalization and localization are issues that were not
   originally addressed by most implementations.  It was always on the
   IAX developers' road map, but never a priority.  While creating this
   document, we formalized support for UTF-8 encoding to better support
   internationalization and localization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With regards to security, many IAX implementations permit cleartext
   authentication.  This method is not secure and should not be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Recently, some issues have been raised regarding server robustness
   when under a DoS attack.  IAX servers that support unauthenticated
   requests can receive the equivalent of a SYN attack.  To mitigate the
   impact of these attacks, various controls to limit the number of
   unauthenticated calls and the number of calls per user may be added
   to the implementation.  Other approaches, such as transferring the
   call to another, more protected port or using IP rate limiting when
   excessive failures are detected, are also suggested.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Lastly, given the open nature of the protocol and implementations, it
   is very easy to extend.  This situation makes Postel's Robustness
   Principle, "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you
   accept from others", essential to any successful IAX implementation.
