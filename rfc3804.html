	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document lists the various VPIM email address formats that are
   currently in common use and defines several new address formats for
   special case usage.   Requirements are imposed on the formats of
   addresses used in VPIM submission mode

   [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the email address format.
   However, it does recommend the use of a numeric LHS since many legacy
   voice mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes.  Further,
   it recommends a structure to handle private, international and
   extensions.  The private format has become deployed in most existing
   VPIM v2 systems, further some systems will only accept messages from
   addresses with a numeric LHS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [IVM] does not describe addressing at all.  The LHS format is left to
   the discretion of the mailbox owner.  However, it is useful in some
   cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a LHS format.  A
   format based on GSTN addressing [GSTN] is presented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines the various recipient (i.e., TO) addresses for
   VPIM and IVM messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions used in this Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "LHS" as used in this document is to be interpreted as the left side
   of the "@" in an email address.  It is defined as "local-part" in
   RFC-2822.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "RHS" as used in this document is to be interpreted as the right side
   of the "@" in an email address.  It is defined as "domain" in RFC-
   2822.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   VPIM v2 Addressing</h2></a>

   This is defined in section 4.1.1 of [VPIM2] and [VPIMV2R2].  Of the
   four groups of addresses defined, the mailbox number format is the
   most commonly used in VPIM v2 systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Example:  6137637582@nortelnetworks.com

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   VPIM Addressing</h2></a>

   VPIM places no restrictions on the form of the Internet address.
   VPIM systems must be capable of receiving an arbitrary email address
   and generating a reply to that address.  No inferences about the
   structure of the local part (LHS) should be necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Recipients email addresses must be created in a form compatible with
   the recipients system and consistent with the address entry
   capabilities of a telephone user interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following sections use formal syntax compliant with RFC 2234,
   "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   VPIM Gateways</h3></a>

   A gateway translates between dissimilar environments.  For VPIM, a
   gateway connects between the VPIM profile of Internet mail and other
   voice mail networking protocols (including voice call answer and
   delivery).  These may be proprietary or standard (like AMIS [AMIS-
   A]).  VPIM gateways typically service multiple voice mail users or,
   in the case of call answer, service only one.  In the former case,
   they serve as a classic "mail transfer agent" (MTA) and in the latter
   as a classic "mail user agent" (UA).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An onramp is a gateway which connects from another voice mail
   networking protocol to VPIM.  An offramp is a gateway which connects
   from VPIM to another voice mail networking protocol.  Behavior of
   onramps and offramps is out of scope for this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification describes the VPIM service portion of onramp and
   offramp addressing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   VPIM Submission LHS</h3></a>

   Limited capability voice mail machines may send messages by default
   to an external message submission gateway.  These gateways will
   convert the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a
   legitimate email address.  Messages requiring address resolution must
   be sent to a submission system which will convert the submitted
   address into the route-able email address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, limited capability email systems may send messages to a
   VPIM onramp system indicated on the RHS.  The LHS would indicate that
   the message is to be sent as a VPIM message to the telephone number
   indicated.  In this case, address and message translation is
   performed by the gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM submission mode MUST be sent in one
   of the following forms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is based on the format defined in [GSTN-ADDR] and extensions in
   [GSTN].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2.1"><h4>4.2.1   The VPIM address</h4></a>

   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as VPIM messages the
   service-selector element is defined to be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   vpim-service-selector = "VPIM"

   The resultant vpim-address and vpim-mbox are formally

   vpim-address = vpim-mbox
                 [ pstn-recipient ]

   vpim-mbox = [ "VPIM=" ] ( global-phone / local-phone )
               [ sub-addr-spec ext-addr-spec dl-addr-spec]

   dl-addr-spec = "/DL=" sub-addr
                           ;note that "/DL=" is case INSENSITIVE
   ext-addr-spec = [ ext-sep sub-addr ]
   ext-sep = ( "/EXT=" / "+" )
                         ; note that "/EXT=" is case INSENSITIVE
                         ; "+" is used for compatibility with current
                         ; VPIM v2 addressing

   For clarity, here is an example of a very simple vpim-mbox:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        VPIM=6137637582

   The extension syntax, that is a phone number followed by "/EXT="
   defining the extension, would be used where the mailbox does not have
   a direct dial number associated with it (e.g., typically behind a
   non-ISDN PBX).  For example:
        VPIM=7035255550/EXT=227

   The distribution list syntax, that is a phone number followed by
   "/DL=" defining the list, would be used to refer to a distribution
   list associated with the phone number (with or without an extension).
   For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        VPIM=+14165977230/DL=93

	<a name="section-4.2.2"><h4>4.2.2   The Voice address</h4></a>

   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as a voice outdialing
   at the destination system, the service-selector element is defined to
   be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   voice-service-selector = "VOICE"

   The resultant voice-address and voice-mbox are formally

   voice-address = voice-mbox
                  [ pstn-recipient ]

   voice-mbox = "VOICE=" ( global-phone / local-phone )
                      [ sub-addr-spec ] [post-sep post-dial]

   For more clarity, here is an example of a very simple voice-mbox:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   VOICE=+3940226338

	<a name="section-4.2.3"><h4>4.2.3   The AMIS address</h4></a>

   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as AMIS (Audio
   Messaging Interchange Specification) voice mail messages (as defined
   in [AMIS-A] and [AMIS-D]), the service-selector element is defined to
   be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   amis-service-selector = "AMIS"

   The resultant amis-address and amis-mbox are formally

   amis-address = amis-mbox

   amis-mbox = "AMIS=" amis-mailbox
               [ "/SYSNUM=" amis-sysnum ]
               ; note that "/SYSNUM=" is case INSENSITIVE

   amis-mailbox = ( amis-a / amis-d )
   amis-a = amis-a-number

   amis-d = [ amis-mailbox-numberplan ][ "+" ] amis-mailbox-id
               [ "+" ] [ amis-mailbox-extension ]
        ; The "+" separators are used to be compatible
               ; the X.400 AMIS-D mailbox definition --
               ; if more than one element is present, both
               ; "+" must appear.  Note also that the total
               ; length of this field is restricted to 32
               ; characters by AMIS-D.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   amis-mailbox-numberplan = 1*VCHAR

   amis-mailbox-id = 1*16(VCHAR)

   amis-mailbox-extension = 1*VCHAR

   amis-sysnum =  amis-a-number

   amis-a-number = ( amis-PSTN-number / amis-private-number )

   amis-PSTN-number = int-country-code "+"
                      area-code "+"

                      ; The "+" separators are used to be

   amis-private-number = "0++" local-number "+"

                      ; digits

   int-country-code = 1*4(DIGIT)

   area-code = 1*(DIGIT)

   local-number = 1*(DIGIT)

   For more clarity, here is an example of a simple AMIS-A amis-mbox:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AMIS=+1/401+3278144+/SYSNUM=1+401+3279542+
	<a name="section-4.2.4"><h4>4.2.4   The fax address</h4></a>

   Fax addresses used in VPIM are formatted as defined in [FAX-ADDR],
   section 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   VPIM Submission Addresses</h3></a>

   Based on [GSTN-ADDR], these are the resultant email addresses for the
   LHS presented above.  VPIM and IVM  systems that support submission
   MUST accept, translate (if necessary), and forward messages sent to
   these addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   The vpim-email</h4></a>

   The vpim-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for VPIM
   over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-selector
   distinction is set to "VPIM".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   vpim-email =  ["/"] vpim-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn

   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a VPIM capable
   messaging system where the attached message will be delivered
   properly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.2"><h4>4.3.2   The voice-email</h4></a>

   The voice-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the
   voice outdialing over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the
   service-selector distinction is set to "VOICE".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   voice-email =  ["/"] voice-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn

   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that will
   perform an outdial, that is for example, make a telephone call to the
   specified number and play a voice attachment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.3"><h4>4.3.3   The amis-email</h4></a>

   The amis-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the
   AMIS over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-
   selector distinction is set to "AMIS".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   amis-email =  ["/"] amis-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn

   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that acts
   as a gateway to an AMIS network where the attached voice message will
   be delivered properly.
	<a name="section-4.3.4"><h4>4.3.4   The fax-email</h4></a>

   Fax email addresses used in VPIM are formatted as defined in [FAX-
   ADDR], section 4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Most security considerations are already identified in [VPIM2] and
   [IVM].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An additional concern would be that the sender must trust and also be
   aware of the policies of the submission MTA to which the message is
   submitted.  This is because, that MTA will make the determination of
   where the final destination is and how it will be delivered based on
   the VPIM submission LHS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Submission MTAs should take care to not blindly place outdial calls
   to any number submitted (e.g., international numbers or "1-900"
   numbers).  Ideally, senders should be authenticated to confirm their
   outdialing privileges.
