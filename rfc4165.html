   This document defines a protocol supporting the transport of
   Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) Message Transfer Part (MTP) Level 3
   signaling messages over Internet Protocol (IP) using the services of
   the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This protocol would
   be used between SS7 Signaling Points using the MTP Level 3 protocol.
   The SS7 Signaling Points may also use standard SS7 links using the
   SS7 MTP Level 2 to provide transport of MTP Level 3 signaling
   messages.  The protocol operates in a manner similar to MTP Level 2
   so as to provide peer-to-peer communication between SS7 endpoints.

	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Scope</h3></a>

   There is a need for Switched Circuit Network (SCN) signaling protocol
   delivery over an IP network.  This includes message transfer between
   the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - a Signaling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC)
        [RFC2719]

      - a SG and an IP Signaling Point (IPSP)

      - an IPSP and an IPSP

   This could allow for convergence of some signaling and data networks.
   SCN signaling nodes would have access to databases and other devices
   in the IP network domain that do not use SS7 signaling links.
   Likewise, IP telephony applications would have access to SS7
   services.  There may also be operational cost and performance
   advantages when traditional signaling links are replaced by IP
   network "connections".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The delivery mechanism described in this document allows for full
   MTP3 message handling and network management capabilities between any
   two SS7 nodes communicating over an IP network.  An SS7 node equipped
   with an IP network connection is called an IP Signaling Point (IPSP).
   The IPSPs function as traditional SS7 nodes using the IP network
   instead of SS7 links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The delivery mechanism should:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - Support seamless operation of MTP3 protocol peers over an IP
        network connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - Support the MTP Level 2 / MTP Level 3 interface boundary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - Support management of SCTP transport associations and traffic
        instead of MTP2 Links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - Support asynchronous reporting of status changes to management.

   The architecture that has been defined [RFC2719] for Switched Circuit
   Network (SCN) signaling transport over IP uses multiple components,
   including an IP transport protocol, the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP), and an adaptation module to support the services
   expected by a particular SCN signaling protocol from its underlying
   protocol layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Within this framework architecture, this document defines an SCN
   adaptation module that is suitable for the transport of SS7 MTP3
   messages.  The adaptation layer, known as the MTP2 User Peer-to-peer
   Adaptation Layer (M2PA), provides MTP3 with an interface and services
   similar to MTP2.  In effect, MTP2 and lower layers of the traditional
   SS7 protocol stack are replaced by an IP equivalent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 1 shows the seamless interworking at the MTP3 layer.  MTP3 is
   adapted to the SCTP layer using the MTP2 User Peer-to-peer Adaptation
   Layer (M2PA).  All the primitives between MTP3 and MTP2 are supported
   by M2PA.  The SCTP association acts as one SS7 link between the
   IPSPs.  An IPSP may have the Signaling Connection Control Part (SCCP)
   and other SS7 layers above MTP3.

            Figure 2.  M2PA in IP Signaling Gateway

   Figure 2 is only an example.  Other configurations are possible.  In
   short, M2PA uses the SCTP association as an SS7 link.  The
   M2PA/SCTP/IP stack can be used in place of an MTP2/MTP1 stack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.5.1"><h4>1.5.1   Point Code Representation</h4></a>

   MTP requires that each node with an MTP3 layer is identified by an
   SS7 point code.  In particular, each IPSP MUST have its own SS7 point
   code.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.6"><h3>1.6   Services Provided by M2PA</h3></a>

   The SS7 MTP3/MTP2 (MTP2-User) interface is retained in the IPSP.  The
   M2PA protocol layer is required to provide a set of services to its
   user equivalent to that provided by MTP Level 2 to MTP Level 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These services are described in the following subsections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.6.1"><h4>1.6.1   Support for MTP Level 2 / MTP Level 3 Interface Boundary</h4></a>

   This interface is the same as the MTP2/MTP3 interface described in
   the applicable SS7 standards [Q.703] [Q.704] [T1.111] [Q.2140], with
   the addition of support for the larger sequence numbers found in
   [T1.111] and [Q.2210].
   M2PA receives the primitives sent from MTP3 to its lower layer.  M2PA
   processes these primitives or maps them to appropriate primitives at
   the M2PA/SCTP interface.  Likewise, M2PA sends primitives to MTP3
   similar to those used in the MTP3/MTP2 interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Because M2PA uses larger sequence numbers than MTP2, the MTP3
   Changeover procedure MUST use the Extended Changeover Order and
   Extended Changeover Acknowledgement messages described in [Q.2210]
   and [T1.111].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also, the following MTP3/MTP2 primitives must use the larger sequence
   numbers:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - BSNT Confirmation

      - Retrieval Request and FSNC

	<a name="section-1.6.2"><h4>1.6.2   Support for Peer-to-Peer Communication</h4></a>

   In SS7, MTP Level 2 sends three types of messages, known as signal
   units: Message Signal Units (MSUs), Link Status Signal Units (LSSUs),
   and Fill-In Signal Units (FISUs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MSUs originate at a higher level than MTP2, and are destined for a
   peer at another node.  Likewise, M2PA passes these messages from MTP3
   to SCTP as data for transport across a link.  These are called User
   Data messages in M2PA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   LSSUs allow peer MTP2 layers to exchange status information.
   Analogous messages are needed for M2PA.  The Link Status message
   serves this purpose.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   FISUs are transmitted continuously when no other signal units are
   waiting to be sent.  FISUs also carry acknowledgement of messages.
   Since an IP network is a shared resource, it would be undesirable to
   have a message type that is sent continuously as is the case with
   FISUs.  Furthermore, SCTP does not require its upper layer to
   continuously transmit messages.  Therefore, M2PA does not provide a
   protocol data unit like the FISU.  The M2PA User Data message is used
   to carry acknowledgement of messages.  If M2PA needs to acknowledge a
   message, and it has no MTP3 message of its own to send, an empty User
   Data message can be sent.
	<a name="section-1.7"><h3>1.7   Functions Provided by M2PA</h3></a>

	<a name="section-1.7.1"><h4>1.7.1   MTP2 Functionality</h4></a>

   M2PA provides MTP2 functionality that is not provided by SCTP; thus,
   together M2PA and SCTP provide functionality similar to that of MTP2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SCTP provides reliable, sequenced delivery of messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   M2PA functionality includes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - Data retrieval to support the MTP3 changeover procedure

      - Reporting of link status changes to MTP3

      - Processor outage procedure

      - Link alignment procedure

	<a name="section-1.7.2"><h4>1.7.2   Mapping of SS7 and IP Entities</h4></a>

   The M2PA layer must maintain a map of each of its SS7 links to the
   corresponding SCTP association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.7.3"><h4>1.7.3   SCTP Association Management</h4></a>

   SCTP allows a user-specified number of streams to be opened during
   the initialization.  It is the responsibility of the M2PA layer to
   ensure proper management of the streams allowed within each
   association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   M2PA uses two streams in each direction for each association.  Stream
   0 in each direction is designated for Link Status messages.  Stream 1
   is designated for User Data messages, as well as Link Status messages
   that must remain in sequence with the User Data messages.  Separating
   the Link Status and User Data messages into separate streams allows
   M2PA to prioritize the messages in a manner similar to MTP2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Notifications received from SCTP are processed by M2PA or translated
   into an appropriate notification to be sent to the upper layer MTP3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.7.4"><h4>1.7.4   Retention of MTP3 in the SS7 Network</h4></a>

   M2PA allows MTP3 to perform all of its Message Handling and Network
   Management functions with IPSPs as it does with other SS7 nodes.

	<a name="section-1.8.1"><h4>1.8.1   Definition of the M2PA / MTP Level 3 Boundary</h4></a>

   The upper layer primitives provided by M2PA are the same as those
   provided by MTP2 to MTP3.  These primitives are described in the
   applicable SS7 standards [Q.703] [Q.704] [T1.111] [Q.2140].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.8.2"><h4>1.8.2   Definition of the Lower Layer Boundary between M2PA and SCTP</h4></a>

   The upper layer primitives provided by SCTP are described in
   [RFC2960] Section 10 "Interface with Upper Layer".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.9"><h3>1.9   Differences Between M2PA and M2UA</h3></a>

   The MTP2 User Adaptation Layer (M2UA) [M2UA] also adapts the MTP3
   layer to the SCTP/IP stack.  It does so through a backhauling
   architecture [RFC2719].  This section is intended to clarify some of
   the differences between the M2PA and M2UA approaches.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A possible M2PA architecture is shown in Figure 3.  Here the IPSP's
   MTP3 uses its underlying M2PA as a replacement for MTP2.
   Communication between the two layers MTP3/M2PA is defined by the same
   primitives as in SS7 MTP3/MTP2.  M2PA performs functions similar to
   MTP2.

   A comparable architecture for M2UA is shown in Figure 4.  In M2UA,
   the MGC's MTP3 uses the SG's MTP2 as its lower SS7 layer.  Likewise,
   the SG's MTP2 uses the MGC's MTP3 as its upper SS7 layer.  In SS7,
   communication between the MTP3 and MTP2 layers is defined by
   primitives.  In M2UA, the MTP3/MTP2 communication is defined as M2UA
   messages and sent over the IP connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      b. M2PA: SG-IPSP connection is an SS7 link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      d. M2PA: SG can have upper SS7 layers, e.g., SCCP.

           Figure 7.  M2PA Association State Transition Diagram

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   M2PA Link State Control</h3></a>

   The M2PA link moves from one state to another in response to various
   events.  The events that may result in a change of state include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - MTP3 primitive requests

      - Receipt of messages from the peer M2PA

      - Expiration of timers

      - SCTP notifications

   These events affect the M2PA link state in a manner similar to MTP2.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Procedures</h2></a>

   Because M2PA provides MTP3 with an interface and functionality like
   MTP2, its internal functioning is similar to that of MTP2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Except as modified in this document, M2PA SHOULD follow the
   requirements of the applicable MTP2 specification.  These may include
   [Q.703] or [T1.111].  The same standard MUST be followed on both ends
   of the M2PA link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In particular, the corresponding applicable timer value defaults and
   ranges specified for the applicable MTP2 standard should be used for
   the M2PA timers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When referring to MTP2 terminology in this document, the terminology
   of [Q.703] is used.  This does not imply that the requirements of
   [Q.703] are to be followed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Procedures to Support MTP2 Features</h3></a>

	<a name="section-4.1.1"><h4>4.1.1   Signal Unit Format, Delimitation, Acceptance</h4></a>

   Messages for transmission across the network must follow the format
   described in Section 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SCTP provides reliable, in-sequence delivery of user messages.
   Therefore the related functionality of MTP2 is not needed.  SCTP does
   not provide functions related to Link State Control in MTP2.  These
   functions must be provided by M2PA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since SCTP provides delivery of messages, there is no need for M2PA
   to delimit its messages with a flag, as is done in MTP2.
   Furthermore, M2PA does not need to perform zero bit insertion and
   deletion on its messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since SCTP uses a checksum to detect transmission errors, there is no
   need for an M2PA checksum, as is needed in MTP2.  This also
   eliminates the need for the error rate monitors of MTP2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since SCTP provides reliable delivery and ordered delivery, M2PA does
   not perform retransmissions.  This eliminates the need for the
   forward and backward indicator bits in MTP2 signal units.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Acceptance of a message is indicated by a successful receipt of the
   message from SCTP.
	<a name="section-4.1.2"><h4>4.1.2   MTP and SCTP Entities</h4></a>

   This section describes how M2PA relates MTP and SCTP entities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each MTP link corresponds to an SCTP association.  To prevent
   duplicate associations from being established, it is RECOMMENDED that
   each endpoint know the IP address (or IP addresses, if multi-homing
   is used) and port number of both endpoints.  SCTP prevents two
   associations with the same IP addresses and port numbers from being
   established.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is necessary for at least one of the endpoints to be listening on
   the port on which the other endpoint is trying to establish the
   association.  Therefore, at least one of the port numbers SHOULD be
   the M2PA registered port.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If only one association is to be established between these two IP
   addresses, then the association SHOULD be established using the M2PA
   registered port at each endpoint.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If it is desirable to create multiple associations (for multiple
   links) between the two IP addresses, different port numbers can be
   used for each association.  Nevertheless, the M2PA registered port
   number SHOULD be used at one end of each association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each combination of IP address/port for the two endpoints (i.e., each
   association) MUST be mapped to the same Signaling Link Code (SLC) at
   each endpoint, so that each endpoint knows which link is being
   created at the time the SCTP association is established.  However,
   M2PA does not do any processing based on the SLC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following are examples of the relationships between associations and
   links.  Note that a link is an SCTP association identified by two
   endpoints.  Each endpoint is identified by an IP address and port
   number.  Each association is mapped to an SLC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 8 shows a case with two IPSPs, each with two IP addresses.
   Two associations are the links that connect the two IPSPs.  Since
   these links are in the same link set, they MUST have different SLCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Table 1 shows the relationships in tabular form.  Table 1 is only
   conceptual.  The actual method for mapping the SCTP associations to
   the SLCs is implementation dependent.

   The association SHALL contain two streams in each direction.  Stream

	<a name="section-4.1.3"><h4>4.1.3   Link Alignment</h4></a>

   The purposes of the alignment procedure are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1) To provide a handshaking procedure so that both endpoints are<br>
          prepared to send SS7 traffic, and to prevent traffic from

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2) To verify that the SCTP association is suitable for use as an<br>

   Link alignment takes place after the association is established.  If
   SCTP fails to establish the association, and M2PA has received a
   Start Request from its MTP3, then M2PA SHALL report to MTP3 that the
   link is out of service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Link Status Out of Service message replaces the SIOS message of
   MTP2.  Unlike MTP2, the message SHOULD NOT be transmitted
   continuously.  After the association is established, M2PA SHALL send
   a Link Status Out of Service message to its peer.  Prior to the
   beginning of alignment, M2PA MAY send additional Link Status Out of
   Service messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Link Status Alignment message replaces the SIO message of MTP2.
   This message is sent to signal the beginning of the alignment
   procedure.  The Link Status Alignment message SHOULD NOT be
   transmitted continuously.  M2PA MAY send additional Link Status
   Alignment until it receives Link Status Alignment, Link Status
   Proving Normal, or Link Status Proving Emergency from the peer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Link Status Proving Normal message replaces the SIN message of
   MTP2.  The Link Status Proving Emergency message replaces the SIE
   message of MTP2.

   applicable MTP2 standard (e.g., [Q.2140]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If proving is performed, then during the proving period (i.e., after
   M2PA starts the proving period timer T4), M2PA SHALL send Link Status
   Proving messages to its peer at an interval defined by the protocol
   parameter Proving_Interval.  It is RECOMMENDED that Proving_Interval
   be set so that the traffic load generated with the Link Status
   Proving messages during the proving period is comparable to the
   normal traffic load expected when the link is in service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Link Status Ready message replaces the FISU of MTP2 that is sent
   at the end of the proving period.  The Link Status Ready message is
   used to verify that both ends have completed proving.  When M2PA
   starts timer T1, it SHALL send a Link Status Ready message to its
   peer in the case where MTP2 would send a FISU after proving is
   complete.  If the Link Status Ready message is sent, then M2PA MAY
   send additional Link Status Ready messages while timer T1 is running.
   These Link Status Ready messages are sent on the Link Status stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the case that MTP2 sends an MSU or SIPO message at the end of
   proving, M2PA SHALL send (respectively) a User Data or Link Status
   Processor Outage message.

   to its peer at the beginning of a processor outage condition where
   MTP2 would send SIPO.  M2PA MAY send additional Link Status Processor
   Outage messages as long as that condition persists.  The Link Status

   The objective of the changeover is to ensure that signaling traffic

   alternative signaling link(s) as quickly as possible while avoiding
   message loss, duplication, or mis-sequencing.  For this purpose, the
   changeover procedure includes data retrieval, which is performed
   before opening the alternative signaling links to the diverted
   traffic.  Data retrieval consists of these steps:
      (1) buffer updating, i.e., identifying all those User Data<br>
          messages in the retransmission buffer of the unavailable
          signaling link which have not been received by the far end
          M2PA, as well as untransmitted messages, and

      (2) transferring those messages to the transmission buffers of the<br>
          alternate links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that only User Data messages containing data are retrieved and
   transmitted over the alternate links.  Link Status messages and empty
   User Data messages SHALL NOT be retrieved and transmitted over the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   M2PA's Sequence Numbers are 24 bits long.  MTP2's Forward and
   Backward Sequence Numbers are only seven bits long.  Hence, it is
   necessary for MTP3 to accommodate the larger sequence numbers.  This
   is done through the use of the Extended Changeover Order (XCO) and
   Extended Changeover Acknowledgement (XCA) messages instead of the
   Changeover Order (COO) and Changeover Acknowledgement (COA) messages.
   The XCO and XCA messages are specified in [Q.2210] Section 9.8.1 and
   T1.111.4 [T1.111], Section 15.4.  Only the XCO and XCA messages from

   The changeover procedure makes it problematic for M2PA to have
   multiple User Data streams in one direction for a link.  Buffer
   updating would have to be done separately for each User Data stream

   one XCO/XCA message for sending the last-received sequence number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Even with sequence numbering of User Data messages at the M2PA layer,
   it is necessary to perform buffer updating on each stream.  Since the
   M2PA messages would be delivered over multiple streams, there could
   be a gap in the M2PA sequence numbers at the receiving end when the
   changeover procedure begins.  If only the M2PA sequence number is
   used in the XCO/XCA message, there would be a possibility of losing
   the messages in the gap, or duplicating messages after the gap.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   M2PA links with multiple User Data streams would be possible if a

   Some M2PA procedures may be affected by the use of SCTP as a
   transport layer.  These considerations are discussed in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   SCTP Slow Start</h4></a>

   SCTP contains a slow start algorithm to control the amount of data
   being injected into the network.  The algorithm allows SCTP to probe
   the network to determine the available capacity.  The algorithm is
   invoked in these cases: when transmission begins on an association,
   after a sufficiently long idle period, or after repairing loss
   detected by the SCTP retransmission timer.
   It is possible that transmission of M2PA messages MAY be delayed by
   SCTP slow start under certain conditions, including the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (a) Link Alignment.  Link alignment takes place after an
          association is established.  SCTP invokes the slow start
          algorithm since transmission is beginning on the association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (b) Changeover.  Messages are retrieved from one link
          (association) and transferred to another for transmission.  If
          the second link had previously been idle, or is in the process
          of link alignment, SCTP may invoke the slow start algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (c) Path failure (multi-homing).  If SCTP switches from a failed
          path to a new path, and the new path had previously been idle,
          SCTP may invoke the slow start algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (d) Reduced traffic volume.  Any time that M2PA sends a low volume
          of traffic on a link and then the volume increases, SCTP may
          invoke the slow start algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Programmers should be aware of this condition and how it may affect
   M2PA performance.  In some cases, it may be possible to avoid the
   negative effects of slow start.  For example, the Link Status Proving
   messages sent during the proving period may be used to complete slow
   start before the link is placed in service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Examples of M2PA Procedures</h2></a>

   In general, messages passed between MTP3 and M2PA are the same as

   An example of a Link Status Indication is shown in Figure 14.  If
   SCTP sends a Communication Lost primitive to M2PA, M2PA notifies MTP3
   that the link is out of service.  MTP3 responds in its usual way.

   Figure 15 shows how M2PA responds to a local processor outage.  M2PA
   sends a Link Status message to its peer.  The peer M2PA notifies MTP3
   of the outage.  MTP3 can then follow the processor outage procedures

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   M2PA is designed to carry signaling messages for telephony services.
   As such, M2PA MUST involve the security needs of several parties:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - the end users of the services

      - the network providers

      - the applications involved

   Additional requirements MAY come from local regulation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While these parties may have some overlapping security needs, their
   needs may not be identical.  Any security solution SHOULD fulfill all
   of the different parties' needs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Consult [RFC3788] for a discussion of security requirements and for
   guidance on the use of security protocols.  Implementers of M2PA MUST
   follow the guidelines in [RFC3788].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier</h3></a>

   The SCTP Registered User Port Number Assignment for M2PA is 3565.
   The TCP Registered User Port Number 3565 is also assigned to M2PA, in
   case a specification for M2PA over TCP is created.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The value assigned by IANA for the Payload Protocol Identifier in the
   SCTP Payload Data chunk is

        M2PA     5

   The SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier is included in each SCTP Data
   chunk, to indicate which protocol the SCTP is carrying.  This Payload
   Protocol Identifier is not directly used by SCTP but may be used by
   certain network entities to identify the type of information being
   carried in a Data chunk.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The User Adaptation peer may use the Payload Protocol Identifier as a
   way of determining additional information about the data being
   presented to it by SCTP.
	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   M2PA Protocol Extensions</h3></a>

   This protocol may be extended through IANA in three ways:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - through definition of additional message classes,

      - through definition of additional message types, and

      - through definition of additional message parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The definition and use of new message classes, types, and parameters
   is an integral part of SIGTRAN adaptation layers.  Thus, these
   extensions are assigned by IANA through an IETF Consensus action as
   defined in [RFC2434].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The proposed extension must in no way adversely affect the general
   working of the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The defined values for the message classes, types, and parameters are
   listed in the Signaling User Adaptation Layer registry
   (sigtran-adapt).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.1"><h4>7.2.1   IETF Defined Message Classes</h4></a>

   The documentation for a new message class MUST include the following
   information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (a) A long and short name for the message class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (b) A detailed description of the purpose of the message class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.2"><h4>7.2.2  IETF Defined Message Types</h4></a>

   Documentation of the message type MUST contain the following
   information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (a) A long and short name for the new message type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (b) A detailed description of the structure of the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (c) A detailed definition and description of the intended use of
          each field within the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (d) A detailed procedural description of the use of the new
          message type within the operation of the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (e) A detailed description of error conditions when receiving this
          message type.
   When an implementation receives a message type that it does not
   support, it MUST discard the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.3"><h4>7.2.3   IETF-defined Parameter Extension</h4></a>

   Documentation of the message parameter MUST contain the following
   information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (a) Name of the parameter type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (b) Detailed description of the structure of the parameter field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (c) Detailed definition of each component of the parameter value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (d) Detailed description of the intended use of this parameter
          type, and an indication of whether, and under what
          circumstances, multiple instances of this parameter type may
          be found within the same message type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.4"><h4>7.2.4   Defined Values</h4></a>

   This section lists the values defined in this document that should be
   included in the Signaling User Adaptation Layer registry
   (sigtran-adapt).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following values for Message Class are defined in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Value
          (decimal)  Message Class
          ---------  -------------
             11      M2PA Messages
