	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Domain-Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism</h2></a>

   In accordance with [RFC5178], this document provides the mechanism-
   specific details needed to implement GSS-API [RFC2743] domain-based
   service names with the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE name SHOULD be mapped to Kerberos V
   principal names as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the <service> name becomes the first (0th) component of the
      Kerberos V principal name;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the <hostname> becomes the second component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the <domain> name becomes the third component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the realm of the resulting principal name is that which
      corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The same name canonicalization considerations and methods as used
   elsewhere in the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121] and Kerberos
   V [RFC4120] in general apply here.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations SHOULD use a Kerberos V name-type of
   NTT-SRVT-HST-DOMAIN (which has the value 12) but MAY use NT-UNKNOWN
   instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Internationalization Considerations</h2></a>

   It is unclear, at this time, how best to address internationalization
   of Kerberos V domain-based principal names.  This is because the
   Kerberos V core protocol internationalization project is incomplete.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, clearly the best way to interoperate when using Kerberos V
   domain-based principal names is to use ACE-encoded internationalized
   domain names [RFC3490] for the hostname and domain name slots of a
   Kerberos V domain-based principal name.  Therefore Kerberos V GSS-API
   mechanism implementations MUST do just that.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Examples</h2></a>

   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,
      "ldap@foo.example@ds1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "ldap/ds1.foo.example/
      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"

   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,
      "kadmin@foo.example@kdc1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "kadmin/kdc1.foo.example/
      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   See [RFC5178].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is important for the security of protocols using the Kerberos V
   GSS-API mechanism and domain-based names, that the realm of domain-
   based principal names be derived from the hostname, rather than the
   domain name slots of the input domain-based name string.
