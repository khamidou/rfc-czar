	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   There are a wide range of networked applications for which it is
   appropriate to provide SNMP Monitoring.  This includes both TCP/IP
   and OSI applications.  This document defines a MIB which contains the
   elements common to the monitoring of any network service application.
   This information includes a table of all monitorable network service
   applications, a count of the associations (connections) to each
   application, and basic information about the parameters and status of
   each application-related association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This MIB may be used on its own for any application, and for most
   simple applications this will suffice.  This MIB is also designed to
   serve as a building block which can be used in conjunction with
   application-specific monitoring and management.  Two examples of this
   are MIBs defining additional variables for monitoring a Message
   Transfer Agent (MTA) service or a Directory Service Agent (DSA)
   service. It is expected that further MIBs of this nature will be
   specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This MIB does not attempt to provide facilities for management of the
   host or hosts the network service application runs on, nor does it
   provide facilities for monitoring applications that provide something
   other than a network service.  Host resource and general application
   monitoring is handled by the Host Resources MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
         describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
         objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
         architectural aspects of the framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
         access to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.
	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Object Definitions</h3></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB</h2></a>

   Much effort has been expended in developing tools to manage lower
   layer network facilities.  However, relatively little work has been
   done on managing application layer entities.  It is neither efficient
   nor reasonable to manage all aspects of application layer entities
   using only lower layer information.  Moreover, the difficulty of
   managing application entities in this way increases dramatically as
   application entities become more complex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This leads to a substantial need to monitor applications which
   provide network services, particularly distributed components such as
   MTAs and DSAs, by monitoring specific aspects of the application
   itself.  Reasons to monitor such components include but are not
   limited to measuring load, detecting broken connectivity, isolating
   system failures, and locating congestion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to manage network service applications effectively two
   requirements must be met:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1)  It must be possible to monitor a large number of components<br>
           (typical for a large organization).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (2)  Application monitoring must be integrated into general<br>
           network management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification defines simple read-only access; this is
   sufficient to determine up/down status and provide an indication of a
   broad class of operational problems.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   General Relationship to Other MIBs</h3></a>

   This MIB is intended to only provide facilities common to the
   monitoring of any network service application.  It does not provide
   all the facilities necessary to monitor any specific application.
   Each specific type of network service application is expected to have
   a MIB of its own that makes use of these common facilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Restriction of Scope</h3></a>

   The framework provided here is very minimal; there is a lot more that
   could be done. For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (1)  General network service application configuration monitoring and<br>
        control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (2)  Detailed examination and modification of individual entries in<br>
        service-specific request queues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (3)  Probing to determine the status of a specific request (e.g. the<br>
        location of a mail message with a specific message-id).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (4)  Requesting that certain actions be performed (e.g. forcing an<br>
        immediate connection and transfer of pending messages to some
        specific system).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All these capabilities are both impressive and useful.  However,
   these capabilities would require provisions for strict security
   checking.  These capabilities would also mandate a much more complex
   design, with many characteristics likely to be fairly
   implementation-specific.  As a result such facilities are likely to
   be both contentious and difficult to implement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document religiously keeps things simple and focuses on the
   basic monitoring aspect of managing applications providing network
   services.  The goal here is to provide a framework which is simple,
   useful, and widely implementable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Relationship to Directory Services</h3></a>

   Use of and management of directory services already is tied up with
   network service application management.  There are clearly many
   things which could be dealt with by directory services and protocols.
   We take the line here that static configuration information is both
   provided by and dealt with by directory services and protocols.  The
   emphasis here is on transient application status.
   By placing static information in the directory, the richness and
   linkage of the directory information framework does not need to be
   repeated in the MIB.  Static information is information which has a
   mean time to change of the order of days or longer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When information about network service applications is stored in the
   directory (regardless of whether or not the network service
   application makes direct use of the directory), it is recommended
   that a linkage be established, so that:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (1)  The managed object contains its own directory name.  This allows<br>
        all directory information to be obtained by reference.  This will
        let a SNMP monitor capable of performing directory queries
        present this information to the manager in an appropriate format.
        It is intended that this will be the normal case.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (2)  The directory will reference the location of the SNMP agent, so<br>
        that an SNMP capable directory query agent could probe dynamic
        characteristics of the object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (3)  This approach could be extended further, so that the SNMP<br>
        attributes are modelled as directory attributes.  This would
        dramatically simplify the design of directory service agents that
        use SNMP to obtain the information they need.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Application Objects</h2></a>

   This MIB defines a set of general purpose attributes which would be
   appropriate for a range of applications that provide network
   services.  Both OSI and non-OSI services can be accomodated.
   Additional tables defined in extensions to this MIB provide
   attributes specific to specific network services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A table is defined which will have one row for each network service
   application running on the system.  The only static information held
   on the application is its name.  All other static information should
   be obtained from various directory services.  The applDirectoryName
   is an external key, which allows an SNMP MIB entry to be cleanly
   related to the X.500 Directory.  In SNMP terms, the applications are
   grouped in a table called applTable, which is indexed by an integer
   key applIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The type of the application will be determined by one or both of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (1)  Additional MIB variables specific to the applications.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (2)  An association to the application of a specific protocol.<br>

   -- OIDs of the form {applTCPProtoID port} are intended to be used
   -- for TCP-based protocols that don't have OIDs assigned by other
   -- means. {applUDPProtoID port} serves the same purpose for
   -- UDP-based protocols. In either case 'port' corresponds to
   -- the primary port number being used by the protocol. For example,
   -- assuming no other OID is assigned for SMTP, an OID of
   -- {applTCPProtoID 25} could be used, since SMTP is a TCP-based
   -- protocol that uses port 25 as its primary port.
