                  jCal: The JSON Format for iCalendar

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This specification defines "jCal", a JSON format for iCalendar data.
   The iCalendar data format is a text format for capturing and
   exchanging information normally stored within a calendaring and
   scheduling application, for example, tasks and events.  JSON is a
   lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format
   commonly used in Internet applications.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The iCalendar data format [RFC5545] is a widely deployed interchange
   format for calendaring and scheduling data.  While many applications
   and services consume and generate calendar data, iCalendar is a
   specialized format that requires its own parser/generator.  In
   contrast, JSON-based formats as defined in [RFC7159] are the native
   format for JavaScript widgets and libraries, and it is appropriate to
   have a standard form of calendar data that is easier to work with
   than iCalendar.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The purpose of this specification is to define "jCal", a JSON format
   for iCalendar data. jCal is defined as a straightforward mapping into
   JSON from iCalendar, so that iCalendar data can be converted to JSON,
   and then back to iCalendar, without losing any semantic meaning in
   the data.  Anyone creating jCal calendar data according to this
   specification will know that their data can be converted to a valid
   iCalendar representation as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key design considerations are essentially the same as those for
   [RFC6321], that is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Round-tripping (converting an iCalendar instance to jCal and back)
      will give the same semantic result as the starting point.  For
      example, all components, properties, and property parameters are
      guaranteed to be preserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Ordering of elements and case of property and parameter names will
      not necessarily be preserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The iCalendar data semantics are to be preserved, allowing a
      simple consumer to easily browse the data in jCal.  A full
      understanding of iCalendar is still required in order to modify
      and/or fully comprehend the calendar data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Extensions to the underlying iCalendar specification must not lead
      to requiring an update to jCal.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  The
   underlying format used for jCal is JSON.  Consequently, the terms
   "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types (strings,
   numbers, booleans, and null) are to be interpreted as described in
   Section 1 of [RFC7159].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some examples in this document contain "partial" JSON documents used
   for illustrative purposes.  In these examples, three periods "..."
   are used to indicate a portion of the document that has been removed
   for compactness.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Converting from iCalendar to jCal</h2></a>

   This section describes how iCalendar data is converted to jCal using
   a simple mapping between the iCalendar data model and JSON elements.
   Aside from the formal description in this section, an informative
   ABNF is specified in Appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In [RFC5545], an iCalendar object comprises a set of "components",
   "properties", "parameters", and "values".  The top level of iCalendar
   data typically contains a stream of iCalendar objects, each of which
   can be considered a "component".  A "component" can contain other
   "components" or "properties".  A "property" has a "value" and a set
   of zero or more "parameters".  Each of these entities have a
   representation in jCal, defined in the following sections.  The
   representation of an iCalendar object in JSON will be named "jCal
   object" throughout this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Pre-processing</h3></a>

   iCalendar uses a line-folding mechanism to limit lines of data to a
   maximum line length (typically 75 octets) to ensure the maximum
   likelihood of preserving data integrity as it is transported via
   various means (e.g., email) -- see Section 3.1 of [RFC5545].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   iCalendar data uses an "escape" character sequence for text values
   and property parameter values.  See Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of [RFC5545]
   as well as [RFC6868].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is a subtle difference in the number representations between
   JSON and iCalendar.  While in iCalendar, a number may have leading
   zeros, as well as a leading plus sign; this is not the case in JSON.
   Numbers should be represented in whatever way needed for the
   underlying format.
   When converting from iCalendar to jCal: First, iCalendar lines MUST
   be unfolded.  Afterwards, any iCalendar escaping MUST be unescaped.
   Finally, JSON escaping, as described in Section 7 of [RFC7159], MUST
   be applied.  The reverse order applies when converting from jCal to
   iCalendar, which is further described in Section 4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   iCalendar uses a base64 encoding for binary data.  However, it does
   not restrict the encoding from being applied to non-binary value
   types.  So, the following rules are applied when processing a
   property with the "ENCODING" property parameter set to "BASE64":

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the property value type is "BINARY", the base64 encoding MUST
      be preserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the value type is not "BINARY", the "ENCODING" property
      parameter MUST be removed, and the value MUST be base64 decoded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When base64 encoding is used, it MUST conform to Section 4 of
   [RFC4648], which is the base64 method used in [RFC5545].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One key difference in the formatting of values used in iCalendar and
   jCal is that in jCal, the specification uses date/time values aligned
   with the extended format of [ISO.8601.2004], which is more commonly
   used in Internet applications that make use of the JSON format.  The
   sections of this document describing the various date and time
   formats contain more information on the use of the complete
   representation, reduced accuracy, or truncated representation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   iCalendar Stream and Objects (RFC 5545, Section 3.4)</h3></a>

   At the top level of the iCalendar object model is an "iCalendar
   stream".  This stream encompasses multiple "iCalendar objects".  As
   the typical use case is transporting a single iCalendar object, there
   is no defined equivalent to an "iCalendar stream" in jCal.  To
   transport multiple jCal objects in a stream, a simple JSON array can
   be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ["vcalendar",
     [ /* Add jCal properties in place of this comment */ ],
     [ /* Add jCal components in place of this comment */ ]
   ]
	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Components (RFC 5545, Section 3.6)</h3></a>

   Each iCalendar component, delimited by "BEGIN" and "END", will be
   converted to a fixed-length array with three fields that have a
   specific structure:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  A string with the name of the iCalendar component, but in
       lowercase.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  An array of jCal properties as described in Section 3.4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  An array of jCal components, representing the sub-components of
       the component in question.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This mapping applies to the top level iCalendar objects, as well as
   individual sub-components in the same way.  The iCalendar to jCal
   component mapping is valid for both current iCalendar components and
   any new iCalendar components added in the future.  Conversion is to
   be done in the same way.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While the grouping of properties and sub-components does not retain
   the original order specified in the iCalendar data, the semantics of
   a component are preserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ["vevent",
     [ /* Add jCal properties in place of this comment */ ],
     [ /* Add jCal components in place of this comment */ ]
   ]

	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Properties (RFC 5545, Sections 3.7 and 3.8)</h3></a>

   iCalendar properties, whether they apply to the "VCALENDAR" object or
   to a component, are handled in a consistent way in the jCal format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In jCal, each individual iCalendar property MUST be represented by an
   array with three fixed elements, followed by one or more additional
   elements, depending on if the property is a multi-valued property as
   described in Section 3.1.2 of [RFC5545].
   The array consists of the following fixed elements:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The name of the property, as a lowercase string.  The iCalendar
       format specifies that property names are case insensitive and
       recommends that they be rendered in uppercase.  In jCal, they
       MUST be in lowercase.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  An object containing the parameters as described in Section 3.5.
       If the property has no parameters, an empty object is used to
       represent that.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  The type identifier string of the value, in lowercase.  Due to
       special casing of certain properties as described in
       Section 3.4.1, it is important that parsers check both the type
       identifier and the value data type and do not rely on assumptions
       based on the property name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The remaining elements of the array are used for one or more values
   of the property.  For single-valued properties, the array has exactly
   four elements; for multi-valued properties, as described in
   Section 3.1.2 of [RFC5545], each value is another element, and there
   can be any number of additional elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the following example, the "categories" property is multi-valued
   and has two values, while the summary property is single-valued:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ["vevent",
     [
       ["summary", {}, "text", "Meeting with Fred"],
       ["categories", {}, "text", "Meetings", "Work"]
       ...
     ],
     [ /* sub-components */ ]
   ]
	<a name="section-3.4.1"><h4>3.4.1   Special Cases for Properties</h4></a>

   This section describes some properties that have special handling
   when converting to jCal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.4.1.1"><h4>3.4.1.1   GEO Property (RFC 5545, Section 3.8.1.6)</h4></a>
                    

   In iCalendar, the "GEO" property value is defined as a semicolon-
   separated list of two "FLOAT" values, the first representing latitude
   and the second longitude.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In jCal, the value for the "geo" property value is represented as an
   array of two values.  The first value of the property represents the
   latitude; the second value represents the longitude.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When converting from jCal to iCalendar, be careful to use a semicolon
   as the separator between the two values as required by [RFC5545].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When converting from jCal to iCalendar, the two values MUST be
   converted using a semicolon as the separator character.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example

   ["vevent",
     [
       ["geo", {}, "float", [ 37.386013, -122.082932 ] ]
       ...
     ],
     ...
   ]

<a name="section-3.4.1.2"><h4>3.4.1.2   REQUEST-STATUS Property (RFC 5545, Section 3.8.8.3)</h4></a>
                    

   In iCalendar, the "REQUEST-STATUS" property value is defined as a
   semicolon-separated list of two or three "TEXT" values.  The first
   represents a code, the second a description, and the third any
   additional data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In jCal, the value for the "request-status" property value is
   represented as an array with two or three values.  The first array
   element corresponds to the code, the second element corresponds to
   the description, and the third element corresponds to the additional
   data.  Each value is represented using a string value.  If there is
   no additional data in the iCalendar value, the last element of the
   array SHOULD NOT be present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When converting from jCal to iCalendar, the two or three values MUST
   be converted using a semicolon as the separator character.
   iCalendar Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   BEGIN:VEVENT
   ...
   REQUEST-STATUS:2.0;Success
   REQUEST-STATUS:3.7;Invalid calendar user;ATTENDEE:
    mailto:jsmith@example.com
   ...
   END:VEVENT

   jCal Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ["vevent":
     [
       ["request-status", {}, "text", ["2.0", "Success"] ],
       ["request-status", {}, "text",
          [
           "3.7",
           "Invalid calendar user",
           "ATTENDEE:mailto:jsmith@example.org"
          ]
       ],
       ...
     ],
     ...
   ]

	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5   Parameters (RFC 5545, Section 3.2)</h3></a>

   Property parameters are represented as a JSON object where each key-
   value pair represents the iCalendar parameter name and its value.
   The name of the parameter MUST be in lowercase; the original case of
   the parameter value MUST be preserved.  For example, the "PARTSTAT"
   property parameter is represented in jCal by the "partstat" key.  Any
   new iCalendar parameters added in the future will be converted in the
   same way.
   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ["vevent":
     [
       ["attendee",
        {
          "partstat": "ACCEPTED",
          "rsvp": "TRUE",
          "role": "REQ-PARTICIPANT"
        },
        "cal-address",
        "mailto:jsmith@example.org"
       ],
       ["summary", {}, "text", "Meeting"],
       ...
     ],
     ...
   ]

	<a name="section-3.5.1"><h4>3.5.1   VALUE Parameter</h4></a>

   iCalendar defines a "VALUE" property parameter (Section 3.2.20 of
   [RFC5545]).  This property parameter MUST NOT be added to the
   parameters object.  Instead, the value type is signaled through the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If the property has a "VALUE" parameter, that parameter's value
       is used as the value type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  If the property has no "VALUE" parameter but has a default value
       type, the default value type is used.

   or property parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Converting from jCal into iCalendar</h2></a>

   Converting jCal to iCalendar reverses the process described in
   Section 3.  This section describes a few additional requirements for
   conversion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When converting component, property, and property parameter names,
   the names SHOULD be converted to uppercase.  Although iCalendar names
   are case insensitive, common practice is to keep them all uppercase
   following the actual definitions in [RFC5545].
   During conversion, JSON escaping MUST be unescaped.  Afterwards,
   iCalendar escaping, as defined by [RFC5545] and [RFC6868], MUST be
   applied.  Finally, long lines SHOULD be folded as described in
   [RFC5545], Section 3.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Non-binary value types MUST NOT be base64 encoded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When converting to iCalendar, the VALUE parameter MUST be added to
   properties whose default value type is unknown, but do not have a
   jCal type identifier "unknown".  The VALUE parameter MAY be omitted
   for properties using the default value type.  The VALUE parameter
   MUST be omitted for properties that have the jCal type identifier
   "unknown".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Handling Unrecognized Properties or Parameters</h2></a>

   In iCalendar, properties can have one or more value types as
   specified by their definition, with one of those values being defined
   as the default.  When a property uses its default value type, the
   "VALUE" property parameter does not need to be specified on the
   property.  For example, the default value type for "DTSTART" is
   "DATE-TIME", so "VALUE=DATE-TIME" need not be set as a property
   parameter.  However, "DTSTART" also allows a "DATE" value to be
   specified, and if that is used, "VALUE=DATE" has to be set as a
   property parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When new properties are defined or "X-" properties used, an iCalendar
   to jCal converter might not recognize them, and not know what the
   appropriate default value types are, yet they need to be able to
   preserve the values.  A similar issue arises for unrecognized
   property parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In jCal, a new "unknown" property value type is introduced.  Its
   purpose is to allow preserving unknown property values when round-
   tripping between jCal and iCalendar.  To avoid collisions, this
   specification reserves the UNKNOWN property value type in iCalendar.
   It MUST NOT be used in any iCalendar as specified by [RFC5545], nor
   any extensions to it.  Thus, the type is registered to the iCalendar
   Value Data Types registry in Section 7.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Converting iCalendar into jCal</h3></a>

   Any property that does not include a "VALUE" property parameter and
   whose default value type is not known, MUST be converted to a
   primitive JSON string.  The content of that string is the unprocessed
   value text.  Also, value type MUST be set to "unknown".
   To correctly implement this format, it is critical that the type
   "unknown" be used if the default type is not known.  If this
   requirement is ignored and, for example, "text" is used, additional
   escaping may occur, which breaks round-tripping values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any unrecognized property parameter MUST be converted to a string
   value, with its content set to the property parameter value text, and
   treated as if it were a "TEXT" value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Converting jCal into iCalendar</h3></a>

   In jCal, the value type is always explicitly specified.  It is
   converted to iCalendar using the iCalendar VALUE parameter, except in
   the following two cases:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the value type specified in jCal matches the default value type
      in iCalendar, the VALUE parameter MAY be omitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the value type specified in jCal is set to "unknown", the VALUE
      parameter MUST NOT be specified.  The value MUST be taken over in

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This specification defines how iCalendar data can be "translated"
   between two different data formats -- the original text format and
   JSON -- with a one-to-one mapping to ensure all the semantic data in
   one format (properties, parameters, and values) are preserved in the
   other.  It does not change the semantic meaning of the underlying
   data itself, or impose or remove any security considerations that
   apply to the underlying data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of JSON as a format does have its own inherent security risks
   as discussed in Section 12 of [RFC7159].  Even though JSON is
   considered a safe subset of JavaScript, it should be kept in mind
   that a flaw in the parser processing JSON could still impose a
   threat, which doesn't arise with conventional iCalendar data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With this in mind, a parser for JSON data should be used for jCal
   that is aware of the security implications.  For example, the use of
   JavaScript's eval() function is considered an unacceptable security
   risk, as described in Section 12 of [RFC7159].  A native parser with
   full awareness of the JSON format should be preferred.
   In addition, it is expected that this new format will result in
   iCalendar data being more widely disseminated (e.g., with use in web
   applications rather than just dedicated calendaring applications).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In all cases, application developers have to conform to the semantics
   of the iCalendar data as defined by [RFC5545] and associated

	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   UNKNOWN iCalendar Value Data Type</h3></a>

   IANA has added the following entry to the iCalendar Data Types
   registry:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Value name:  UNKNOWN

   Purpose:  To allow preserving property values whose default value
      type is not known during round-tripping between jCal and
      iCalendar.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Format definition:  N/A

   Description:  The UNKNOWN value data type is reserved for the
      exclusive use of the jCal format.  Its use is described in
      Section 5 of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:  As this registration serves as a reservation of the UNKNOWN
      type so that it is not used in iCalendar, there is no applicable
      iCalendar example.  Examples of its usage in jCal can be found in
      this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IANA has made the "Status" column for this entry in the registry say,
   "Reserved - Do not use" and has made the "Reference" column refer to
   Section 5 of this document.

   Below is an ABNF schema as per [RFC5234] for iCalendar in JSON.  ABNF
   symbols not described here are taken from [RFC7159].  The schema is
   non-normative and given for reference only.

   [calconnect-artifacts].
