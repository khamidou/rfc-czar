                 Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document proposes four cryptographic user interface suites
   ("UI suites") for IP Security (IPsec), similar to the two suites
   specified in RFC 4308.  The four new suites provide compatibility
   with the United States National Security Agency's Suite B
   specifications.  This document obsoletes RFC 4869, which presented
   earlier versions of these suites.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   [RFC4308] proposes two optional cryptographic user interface suites
   ("UI suites") for IPsec.  The two suites, VPN-A and VPN-B, represent
   commonly used present day corporate VPN security choices and
   anticipated future choices, respectively.  [RFC4869] proposed four
   new UI suites based on implementations of the United States National
   Security Agency's Suite B algorithms (see [SuiteB]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As with the VPN suites, the Suite B suites are simply collections of
   values for some options in IPsec.  Use of UI suites does not change
   the IPsec protocols in any way.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document reduces the scope of the suites in [RFC4869] while
   retaining the original suite names.  A detailed list of the changes
   is given in Section 6.  This document obsoletes RFC 4869.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Requirements Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   New UI Suites</h2></a>

   Each of the following UI suites provides choices for ESP (see
   [RFC4303]) and for Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) (see [RFC5996]).
   The four suites are differentiated by the choice of cryptographic
   algorithm strengths, and a choice of whether the Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) is to provide both confidentiality and
   integrity or integrity only.  The suite names are based on the
   Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] mode and AES key length specified
   for ESP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IPsec implementations that use these UI suites MUST use the suite
   names listed here.  IPsec implementations SHOULD NOT use names
   different than those listed here for the suites that are described,
   and MUST NOT use the names listed here for suites that do not match
   these values.  These requirements are necessary for interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Suite "Suite-B-GCM-128"</h3></a>

   This suite provides ESP integrity protection and confidentiality
   using 128-bit AES-GCM (see [RFC4106]).  This suite or the following
   suite should be used when ESP integrity protection and encryption are
   both needed.

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document inherits all of the security considerations of the
   IPsec and IKEv2 documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some of the security options specified in these suites may be found
   in the future to have properties significantly weaker than those that
   were believed at the time this document was produced.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA maintains a registry called "Cryptographic Suites for IKEv1,
   IKEv2, and IPsec" (see [IANA-Suites]).  The registry consists of a
   text string and an RFC number that lists the associated transforms.
   The four suites in this document have been listed with this document
   as the RFC reference.  These entries will be updated upon approval of
   this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The updated values for the registry are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Identifier              Defined in
   Suite-B-GCM-128         RFC 6379
   Suite-B-GCM-256         RFC 6379
   Suite-B-GMAC-128        RFC 6379
   Suite-B-GMAC-256        RFC 6379

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Changes from RFC 4869</h2></a>

   The changes from [RFC4869] are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. Removed definitions of the suites for IKEv1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Removed IKE authentication methods from the suite definitions.
      These now appear in [RFC6380].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. Removed the requirements on rekeying in IKEv2.
