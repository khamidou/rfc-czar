            Addition to the Very Distant Host Specification


     It has been brought to my attention that the following sentence
should be added to the Very Distant Host specification in Appendix F of
BBN report 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a Host and an
IMP, to the paragraph beginning on page F-5 and ending on page F-7:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">"Null packets do not use a channel (nor a channel number) when sent and
are not acknowledged when received."

     Please file this RFC with your copy of BBN report 1822 until 1822
is next updated.

</p>
