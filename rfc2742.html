	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   The SNMP Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
      1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
      [12].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [13].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The SNMP Agent Extensibility Protocol (AgentX) is a protocol used to
   distribute the implementation of an SNMP agent amongst a single
   "master agent" and multiple "subagents". See [17] for details about
   the AgentX protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The goals of the AgentX MIB are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  List the set of subagent connections that currently have logical
      sessions open with the master agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Identify each subagent connection transport address and type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Identify each subagent session vendor, AgentX protocol version,
      and other characteristics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Identify the set of MIB objects each session implements, the
      context in which the objects are registered, and the priority of
      the registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Determine protocol operational parameters such as the timeout
      interval for responses from a session and the priority at which a
      session registers a particular MIB region.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Allow (but do not require) managers to explicitly close subagent
      sessions with the master agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   AgentX MIB Overview</h2></a>

   This MIB is organized into four groups.  The agentxGeneral group
   provides information describing the master agent's AgentX support,
   including the protocol version supported.  The agentxConnection group
   provides information describing the current set of connections
   capable of carrying AgentX sessions.  The agentxSession group
   provides information describing the current set of AgentX sessions.
   The agentxRegistration group provides information describing the
   current set of registrations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Three tables form the heart of this mib.  These are the connection,
   session, and registration tables.
   Entries in the registration table exist in a many-to-one relationship
   with entries in the session table.  This relationship is expressed
   through the two common indices, agentxSessionIndex and
   agentxConnIndex.  Entries in the registration table also exist in a
   many-to-one relationship with entries in the connection table.  This
   relationship is expressed through the common index, agentxConnIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Entries in the session table exist in a many-to-one relationship with
   entries in the connection table.  This relationship is expressed
   through the common index, agentxConnIndex.

	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There is a single management object defined in this MIB that has a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  This object may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   There is a single managed object in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information. This object is agentxSessionAdminStatus.
   Setting agentxSessionAdminStatus to an inappropriate value can
   effectively prevent access to management information, or provide
   access to inappropriate information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide
   features for such a secure environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/delete) them.
