               Draft design for a text/graphics protocol

DRAFT DESIGN FOR A TEXT/GRAPHICS PROTOCOL

   This proposal should be seen as a synthesis of existing ideas rather
   than an attempt to put forth new ones.  It is based on work by the
   NGG, Elaine Thomas, Peter Deutsch, Charles Irby, Ken Victor, Bill
   Duvall, Bob Sproull, and others at ARC, PARC, and BBN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We are concerned about the lack of text-handling capabilities of the
   protocol suggested in RFC 493.  Also, we feel that the protocol will
   have a significant influence on the interface provided to writers of
   future graphics application programs, and consequently that such
   things as "beam twiddling" should not be part of the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Things of this nature address the problem at too low a level for a
      facility which is intended to service the needs of a wide range of
      graphics devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      We feel that, although the breakdown into "levels" as proposed in
      RFC 493 may be expedient for initial experimentation, it is
      inappropriate for a Network Standard Protocol.  Instead, we
      propose that the protocol allow for two levels, segmented and
      structured.  This allows the writers of graphics application
      programs to deal with a very simple display facility (segments
      consisting of lines, dots, or character strings) or with a
      powerful structure of display subroutines.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We propose an experimental implementation of such a scheme on the
   ARC, BBN, and PARC systems to test these ideas using several
   application programs (including NLS) and at least an IMLAC, ARDS, and
   an E&S LDS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Environment

   We are trying to design a protocol used to communicate with a
   "virtual display" to operate at the other end of a wire (ARPANET
   connection) from a "host" which is running some kind of display
   application program.
      We will adopt the terminology that the human user, sitting at the
      display, is the "user" and the application program is the
      "server".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We wish to stress the fact that within a single application, a single
   terminal should be useable both as an "interactive graphics" terminal
   AND as an "interactive control" terminal.  Thus, the graphics
   protocol must allow for teletype-like operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The need for two sets of connections for running graphics programs
   over the Net (according to our understanding) is centered about the
   issue of handling (being able to recover gracefully from) berserk
   programs (and perhaps achieving greater bandwidth through the net).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We recognize this problem but also think one should be able to run
   graphics programs using only one set of telnet connections.  Also, it
   seems obvious that even though one is running a graphics program, one
   must expect to be able to handle "unescorted" characters (not
   embedded in a command or response message) being sent to his
   terminal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Consequently, we are proposing that the graphics protocol be
   implemented within telnet using 8-bit BEGIN-GRAPHICS-COMMAND and
   END-GRAPHICS-COMMAND characters or the 8-bit transparent mode of the
   new telnet.  This means that one will be able to run graphics
   programs with one, two, or more sets of telnet connections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We also strongly propose that any site which is interested in
   supporting display terminals for use in network graphics would be
   prudent to implement local control over the display (such as IGNORE-
   GRAPHICS-COMMANDS, RESET-TO-TTY-MODE commands from the user to the
   using host).  Failure to take such precautions may very well lead to
   burned out tubes!

Basic concepts

   The model

      The model we are adopting consists of an application program
      manipulating a (remote) display file.  This file may be
      "segmented" or "structured", in which case it may be manipulated
      independently from the display itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For structured display files an "update display" command causes
         the display file to get mapped onto the display in whatever
         fashion is appropriate for the display.
      Part of this protocol deals with commands issued to the (remote)
      display file editor.  This editor creates and changes the display
      file at the user host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Structured Display Files

      A structured display file consists of named subpictures, each
      containing any number of named units.  There are two types of
      units, primitive units and call units.  The effect of a unit is
      independent of its name or creation within the subpicture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Primitive units contain drawing instructions and associated
         coordinates that may generate visible information on the
         display screen.  Drawing instructions and coordinates can occur
         only in primitive units.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Call units give the display structure a subroutine capability.
         A call unit invokes the display of another subpicture.  In
         other words, a call unit allows one subpicture to contain
         instances of other subpictures.  As well as providing for
         subroutine-style control transfer, call units can be used to
         establish display parameters and maintain parameter
         transparency.  For example, a call unit can be used to call a
         subpicture with a translation and relative intensity setting.
         On return from the called subpicture, these parameters are
         restored to their original values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         A subpicture is an ordered list of units which can be any
         mixture of primitive and call units.  Each subpicture begins
         with a header and terminates with the subpicture end unit.  The
         subpicture end unit is a single unique unit in a display
         structure linked to the end of each subpicture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         In order to understand how control passes through a structure,
         one can think of the display elements as follows: subpictures
         are subroutines and units are linked blocks of in-line code.
         When all of the units contained in a subpicture have been
         executed, the subpicture end unit returns control to wherever
         the subpicture was called from.  A primitive unit contains
         display code and transfer to the next unit.  A call unit
         contains a subroutine call to a subpicture and a transfer to
         the next unit in line.
   Segmented Display Files

      A segmented display file consists of named segments, each
      containing any number of primitive units.  The only operations
      available for segmented display file is to add new, delete old, or
      replace old segments (updating the actual display happens
      automatically).  The effect of a unit is independent of its name
      or creation order within the subpicture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Hosts

      Since a given terminal may be under partial control of several
      different hosts, all further discussion of names, coordinates,
      display files, etc. should be taken as relative to each individual
      host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      That is, each host believes it has a display file, naming, and
      coordinate space and a set of state parameters entirely under its
      control; its only evidence of resource sharing is that the
      terminal may appear to be of different sizes at different times.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (We feel that in principle it should be processes within hosts,
      rather than hosts, that enjoy these properties, but it does not
      seem feasible to construct a process identification scheme that
      all hosts will find acceptable.)

   Subpictures

      A subpicture has a name and zero or more units.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Subpicture names are arbitrary, globally unique, fixed-length
         identifiers (subpicture names are chosen by the host).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Each unit (displayable component) has a name, which is local to
         the subpicture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A unit may be a "primitive unit", such as a string or a vector, or
      a "call unit", which implies displaying a (possibly transformed)
      copy of another subpicture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The display data are organized into a re-entrant tree (acyclic
         graph) by the call units.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A unit may be "visible" or "invisible".
         A particular instance of a subpicture (the result of a call-
         unit) appears on the screen precisely if it and all subpictures
         on the logical path to it from the root of the tree are
         "visible".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Primitive units

      Strings

         A string is a horizontal line of characters with its own mode
         and X,Y origin relative to the origin of the subpicture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Note: intensity is always relative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Font and mode (e.g. blinking) information logically accompanies
         each character.  This is accomplished by means of embedded mode
         and font specification characters and a "restore original
         string mode and font" character.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Note: Mode modifiers are non-displayable characters and do
            not take up character positions on the screen.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Determining the space occupied on the screen by a string
         requires knowledge of the font(s) being used; this is a
         separate question which is dealt with later.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TTY units

      A tty unit is a rectangle that consists of a number of lines.
      Within this unit the display acts as if it were an alpha-numeric
      display, e.g.,

         characters which would write beyond the right hand margin of
         the rectangle cause an automatic line folding to take place

         ascii control characters CarriageReturn, LineFeed, FormFeed,
         and BackSpaceCharacter, (HorizontalTab and VerticalTab?), are
         interpreted appropriately

         other control characters are displayed in a terminal specific
         manner, e.g. ^F, <^F>, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         display of the characters in the range 200-377 is left
         unspecified at this point (truncated to 7 bits?, alternate
         fonts?, alternate modes?)
            It is hoped that we can agree on a standardization of some
            of the characters in this range to allow for such things as
            greek letters, common mathematical symbols, super-scripting,
            and sub-scripting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         linefolding that would cause characters to be written below the
         rectangle (whether performed automatically or by a LineFeed
         character, etc.) cause the text within the unit to be scrolled
         upwards one line (storage tube may adopt a different scheme).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Characters are displayed in a teletype unit in one of two ways:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Characters sent to the terminal that are not part of any
         command (unescorted characters) are appended to appropriate
         tty-units (see below --- USE-TTY-UNITS, TTY)

         By use of the APPEND-STRING-TO-UNITS command for structured
         display files

      The first character sent to a tty-unit appears as the first
      character (at the left margin) of the top line.  This is necessary
      for a number of reasons, the most convincing of which is the
      behavior characteristics of storage tubes and most real alpha-
      numeric displays.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Successive characters appear as successive characters within
         the top line until either an explicit (e.g., linefeed) or
         implicit (line overflow) line break occurs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         When a line break occurs, the next character appears on the
         second from the top line of the unit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         This continues until the bottom line of the tty-unit is
         reached.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            At this point, a line break causes the lines within the unit
            to scroll up one line.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">               Note: Storage scopes may use a different technique for
               scrolling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Dots

         A dot unit consists of an initial X0,Y0 followed by a series of
         points X,Y which describe a series of dots.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Each dot unit logically carries mode information such as
         blinking, relative intensity, etc.
      Lines

         A line unit consists of an origin X0,Y0 followed by a series of
         points X,Y which describes a series of straight lines connected
         tail-to-head (i.e. a polygon).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Each line unit logically carries mode information such as
         blinking, dotted vs. solid, invisible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Other kinds of lines, such as conic sections, may belong in the
         primitive set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Special points

         This primitive unit consists of a series of points, which will
         be displayed joined by lines in the best available manner.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The intent is to use Flegal's algorithms to produce a smooth
         curve.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Device-specific

         This primitive unit consists of any number of device specific
         commands.  The device type may be obtained through an
         interrogation command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Call units

      In addition to the name of the referenced subpicture, a call unit
      may include the following transformations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Master/instance rectangle: specifies a rectangle in the
         caller's space into which a specified rectangle of the callee's
         space is to be imaged.  This provides independent scaling in
         each coordinate as well as translation and clipping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Rotation.  It may be desirable to combine this with scaling
         using the familiar idea of homogeneous transformation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Intensity and color control.  In principle, a call could
         specify intensity increments (positive or negative) for each
         color.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         It is assumed that best effort will be used in scaling and
         rotation of text.  We recommend replacing it by a line when all
         else fails.
   Initial state

      After the initial telnet connection is established, the first
      graphics command issued by the applications program should be a
      request for either a structured display file or for a segmented
      display file.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The response to this request should be whether or not the
         requested display file was allocated and other parameters about
         the virtual display, e.g. screen size, character sizes, whether
         or not color is available, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Before the display file is allocated, the terminal should appear
      as, and simulate to the best of its ability, a Network Virtual
      Terminal (NVT).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Any graphic commands issued before the allocation of a display
      file will be ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      After requesting commands and receiving a structured display file,
      the following structure will exist:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         There will exist a subpicture, referred to as the ICP
         SUBPICTURE, whose rectangular extent corresponds to the extent
         of the virtual display allocated to this host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         There will exist a tty-unit, referred to as the ICP TTY-UNIT,
         in the ICP SUBPICTURE, where rectangular extent corresponds to
         the extent of the virtual display allocated to this host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            This tty-unit will consist of n lines, where n is terminal
            dependent and available through a query command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            This tty-unit will be instituted for the display of
            unescorted characters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         There will be in effect an implicit call on the ICP SUBPICTURE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            This call is not accessible to the applications program.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The applications program causes the display of information by:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            1) creating primitive units in the ICP SUBPICTURE

            2) creating call units, to created subpictures, in the ICP
               SUBPICTURE
            3) using the TTY command to make visible/invisible the ICP
               TTY-UNIT (or change its location or size)

      After requesting and receiving a segmented display file, the
      following structure will exist:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         There will exist a segment, referred to as the ICP SEGMENT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            There will exist a tty-unit, referred to as the ICP TTY-
            UNIT, in the ICP SEGMENT, whose rectangular extent
            corresponds to the extent of the virtual display allocated
            to this host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            This tty-unit will consist of n lines, where n is terminal
            dependent and available through a query command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            This tty-unit will be instituted for the display unescorted
            characters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The applications program causes the display of information by:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            1) creating primitive units in the ICP SEGMENT

            2) creating new segments

            3) using the TTY command to make visible/invisible the ICP
               TTY-UNIT (or to relocate it or change its size)

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         TTY-UNIT(Subpicture, unit, mode, rectangle, lines)

            Creates a unit which will behave as a tty-simulation area
            with "lines" lines distributed within the specified
            rectangle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Errors: Subpicture does not exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         DEVICE-SPECIFIC-UNIT(Subpicture, Unit, Target-Key, device,
         commands)

            Creates a unit of device specific commands.  The action of
            the commands should leave alone (or at least restore) any
            global modes, e.g., the standout mode (see below).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      APPEND-STRING-TO-UNIT(Subpicture, Unit, Text)

         Appends the specified text to the specific commands.  This only

      VISIBLE-UNIT(Subpicture, Unit, Flag)

         Makes the Unit visible or invisible as specified by Flag.  If a
         unit which is target sensitive is made invisible, it is no
         longer target sensitive.  However, in the absence of a
         subsequent modifying target sensitive command, the unit becomes
         target sensitive again if it should be made visible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Errors: Subpicture does not exist, unit does not exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SET-TARGET-KEY(Subpicture, Unit, Target-Key)

         Sets the target key for the specified unit to the specified
         value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SET-STANDOUT-MODE(mode)

         Sets the mode that will be used to make text and/or units stand
         out to blinking, underlining, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         If the terminal does not support the specified mode, the
         terminal should make a best effort or use another method to
         make things stand out.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STANDOUT-UNIT(Subpicture, unit, yesno)

         makes the specified unit stand out (according to the mode set
         by SET-STANDOUT-MODE) or not, according to "yesno".  If the
         unit which is to stand out is a call-unit, the instance of the
         subpicture which is the result of the call (all the way to the
         terminal nodes) is made to stand out.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STANDOUT-TEXT(Subpicture, unit, begin-char-count, end-char-count,
      yesno)

         Unit must refer to a string unit.

         by SET-STANDOUT-MODE) or not, according to "yesno".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      UPDATE-STRUCTURED-DISPLAY()

         This causes any changes that have been made to the display
         file, since the last update or since ICP, to be reflected on
         the screen.
      TTY(parameters)

         parameters are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            position rectangle, visible/invisible, number of lines, mode
            of characters

         This refers to the ICP TTY simulation

      USE-TTY-UNITS(Subpicture1, unit1, ..., Subpicturen, unitn)

         Unescorted characters are to be appended only to the specified
         tty units.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Errors: Subpicture, unit does not exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      RESET(How)

         Case How Of

            =  Permanent

               Immediately resets the terminal to its initial ICP state

            =  Temporary

               Immediately resets the terminal to its initial ICP state
               without destroying the previous state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            =  Restore state saved from last RESET(Temporary).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Direct Feedback

   It seems extremely desirable, given network speeds, to allow the
   using host to perform direct feedback to the user without
   intervention from the application program in the serving host.  This
   is already done in telnet with local echoing.  We propose extending
   this capability to graphics by allowing "dragging" (attaching a
   subpicture's origin to the position of the cursor), "tracking"
   (following the movement of the mouse, stylus, or light pen with a
   distinctive mark on the screen), "inking" (plotting the trail of the
   cursor on the screen) and "rubber banding" (a straight line attached
   to a fixed point on one end the cursor location on the other).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These should be seen as allowable extensions of the protocol rather
   than as requirements.  There should, however, be commands available
   in the protocol for determining their existence and controlling them.
Data input primitives

   Input Control

      TARGET-SENSATIVE(key1, ..., keyn)

         Arms the units which have the specified keys for target
         selection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SET-INPUT-MODE(Device, parameters)

         Selects the mode in which a logical device shall produce input
         and under what conditions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         the logical devices are specified below as well as their
         possible input formats and conditions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Errors: no such device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Keyboard input

      The keyboard has only one input mode, in which it sends a
      character whenever a key is struck.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Binary devices

      Unless otherwise specified, binary devices act as an extension of
      the keyboard and produce 8-bit characters which are not
      distinguishable from keyboard characters by the serving host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The algorithm for translating binary devices into characters is
         not specified, but something like the NLS accumulation
         algorithm for mouse-keyset chords is intended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Binary devices may also input binary data (according to their
      up/down states), which is transmitted on state changes.  Examples
      of this type of device are function keys and overlay cards, mouse
      and keyset (used independently or together), pen-up/pen/down,
      light pen buttons, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Coordinate input

      Coordinates may be sent according to any subset of the following
      criteria: with every character in some designated set (e.g.
      control characters, or all characters); with every binary device
      state change input; after some time interval has elapsed; after a
      position change P > (y1-y0) ^2+(x1-x0)^2, etc.
      Coordinates may be sent in either or both of "X-Y" or "target"
      format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         X-Y format is just the location of the cursor relative to the
         screen region assigned to the host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Target format is the "call stack" (logical path from the root
         unit - the ICP SUBPICTURE - to the closest unit) plus the
         target-key of that unit plus the count of the closest character
         within the string or the closest line segment or dot or special
         point if appropriate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Target input is unavailable for segmented display files.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            In the event of overlapping target sensitive units, it is
            not specified which of the units selected will be returned
            as the hit unit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Time input

      Since hosts may wish to consider two events happening sufficiently
      close together to be simultaneous, or to keep detailed interaction
      statistics, it must be possible to request time information to be
      sent with some reasonable subnet of other types of input.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Interrogations

   It must be possible for the serving host to discover its environment
   (e.g. screen size, available devices) and to read back state
   information (display file).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This is very desirable both for debugging and for redirecting a
      displayed image to another device (e.g. a plotter).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Environment

      Terminal parameters: screen size and resolution, available input
      devices, terminal type (for device specific control), number of
      lines in the ICP TTY-UNIT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Character parameters: available character sizes, special (non-
      ASCII) characters, font characteristics, sub- and super-scripting
      facilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   State

      Display file or display file components.
      Cursor Position

         It should be possible for the application program to read the
         cursor position at any time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Display File Support

         It should be possible to find out if this user process supports
         only segmented or structured display files, or both.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Command support

         It should be possible to get a matrix from the user process
         which indicates which commands are implemented.  This is a
         necessity to find out which, if any, of the direct feedback
         features are supported, and might be nice to allow for, e.g.,
         the possibility of a text only or graphics only subset of the
         protocol to be implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Encoding Principles

   Commands will have the format : BGC OPCODE DATA EGC where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      BGC (Begin Graphics Command) places the telnet connection into a
      "read graphics command" mode,

      OPCODE DATA is the specific graphics command and data, and

      EGC (End Graphics Command) restores the telnet connection to its
      normal state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note: This may all have to be bracketed by telnet Begin-8-bit-
      transparent-mode and End-8-bit-transparent-mode commands.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Numbers in general will have have 7-bits of significance in each byte
   -- if the high order of a byte is on, then the significant bits from
   the next byte should be concatenated onto the low-order end of the
   bits collected so far, etc..

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subpicture names - shall be 14-bit numbers, assigned by the serving
   host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unit names - shall be 14-bit numbers, assigned by the serving host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Strings - shall be 8-bit characters, with an escape convention to
   represent changes of font and mode.
      Since the channel is 8-bits wide, there is room for many more than
      128 displayable characters.  However, the interpretation of codes
      200B and above is not standardized!

   Coordinates should be as described in RFC 493.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Rectangles - shall be specified by the coordinates of the endpoints
   of one of the diagonal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Encoding

   The actual encoding of this protocol is forthcoming.  Since we expect
   some changes to come about because of the upcoming Network Graphics
   Group Meeting, we have postponed the actual encoding until after this
   meeting.
