   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace that
   is engineered by a consortium (general contractor, Olimps LTD, and
   subcontractors, ABC software LTD, Microsoft Latvia LTD, Riga Internet
   eXchange (RIX) Technologies LTD, and Microlink LTD) for naming
   information resources published and produced by the Latvian National

   The IVIS uses and produces many kinds of information resources such
   as E-services, E-service instances, specifications, standards,
   working documents, and XML schemas.  An ID in IVIS has to be unique
   for global use every time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Uniqueness is guaranteed by the IVIS that issues the numbers.  The
      numbers are not reassigned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Identifier persistence considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon the persistence of

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Process of identifier assignment:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled and
      managed by the IVIS and its subsystems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Process of identifier resolution:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The holders of system names are responsible for operating or

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Community Considerations</h2></a>

   Every Latvian ministry's local authority produces many kinds of
   different documents, offers public services.  Each of the information
   resources is already uniquely identified within an authority-
   producer.  The IVIS URN namespace helps unify information resource
   identifiers by using existent Latvian government authority
   identification procedures to produce E-services and different
   documents where many parties are involved.  Any citizen or
   organization with Internet web browser capability will be entitled to
   access the namespace and its associated application, registration,
   and resolution services.  The primary IVIS namespace usage is to
   identify information resources, such as XML messages, their schemas,
   and other resources, which can be public or have a special
   destination, when a few different parties are involved in the
   interchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document includes a RUN Network Identifier (NID) registration
   for IVIS for entry in the IANA registry of URN NIDs (see [RFC2434]
   for more information).
	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Namespace Considerations</h2></a>

   To select necessary identifier schema, we spend a lot time and
   decided on URN, because an IVIS URN namespace has to resolve the
   following problems:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - Information resource uniqueness

      Uniqueness makes it possible to find a necessary resource and call
      it anytime.  Uniqueness gives stability in message sending and
      storing operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - Namespace understandability

      IVIS URN consists of parts, which can guarantee namespace
      legibility.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - Information resource resolution

      One of the IVIS namespace parts identifies the place where the
      resource can be found (resolved).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Therefore, a new URN assignment is required, and individual URNs
      shall be assigned through the process of development of each XML
      schema.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

      There are no additional security considerations besides those
      normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in
      general.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Acknowledgements</h2></a>

      Since the specification described in this document is derived from
      [RFC3305], [RFC3616], [RFC3986], [RFC3622], and [RFC3406] the
      acknowledgements in those documents still apply.  In addition, the
