   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3
   Medium Attachment Units (MAUs).  This document obsoletes RFC 3636.
   It amends that specification by moving MAU type OBJECT-IDENTITY
   definitions and relevant textual conventions into a separate Internet
   Assigned Number Authority (IANA) maintained MIB module.  In addition,
   management information is added to enable support for Ethernet in the
   First Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4 MAUs.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3
   [IEEE802.3] Medium Attachment Units (MAUs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The previous version of this document, RFC 3636 [RFC3636], defined a
   single MIB module.  This document splits the original MIB module into
   two, putting frequently updated object identities and textual
   conventions into a separate, IANA-maintained MIB module, in order to
   decrease the need of updating the basic MAU MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first version of the IANA-maintained MIB module also extends the
   list of managed objects to support Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM)
   and 10GBASE-CX4 interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h2></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3
   MAU.  Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD
   standard [IEEE802.3].  These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3
   repeaters or to 802.3 (Ethernet-like) interfaces.  For convenience,
   this document refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and
   "interface MAUs."

   The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.5, "Layer
   Management for 10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s, and 10 Gb/s Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs)", Section 30.6, "Management for link Auto-
   Negotiation", and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specifications for 802.3 managed
   object classes" of IEEE Std. 802.3-2005 [IEEE802.3].  This
   specification is intended to provide for management of all types of
   Ethernet/802.3 MAUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Relationship to RFC 3636</h3></a>

   The management definitions provided in this document are intended to
   be a superset of those defined by RFC 3636 [RFC3636].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to decrease the need of updating the basic MAU MIB module
   due to the new MAU type, Media Available state, Auto Negotiation
   capability and/or Jack type introduction, all relevant object
   identities and textual conventions have been moved to a separate,
   IANA-maintained MIB module IANA-MAU-MIB, the first version of which
   is defined in this document.  Thus when a new MAU type, Media
   Available state, Auto Negotiation capability, and/or Jack type is
   defined by the IEEE 802.3 working group, only the IANA-maintained
   module needs to be revised, leaving the basic MAU-MIB module defined
   in this document unchanged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, the new definitions are added to the IANA-maintained MIB
   module, to support Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4
   interfaces, defined in IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004 [IEEE802.3ah] and IEEE
   Std 802.3ak-2004 [IEEE802.3ak] respectively, now part of IEEE Std
   802.3-2005 [IEEE802.3].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that the changes made in this revision will not be
   entirely backward-compatible with MIB modules that currently import
   MAU type object identity descriptors from the MAU-MIB; such modules
   will need to be revised to import those DESCRIPTORS from the IANA-
   MAU-MIB.  Similarly, any management applications that process the
   object identity definitions (e.g., to present the DESCRIPTION text to
   a user) will need to get those definitions from the IANA-MAU-MIB
   instead of the MAU-MIB.  While it is true that changes that require
   such adjustments are not strictly compliant with the SMIv2 rules
   governing MIB module revisions (see [RFC2578] Section 10), in this
   case continued high maintenance costs that would result from not
   making these changes make the deviation from the rules justified.  It
   should be noted that the working group was not able to find any
   examples of MIB modules or management applications that would
   actually be negatively affected by the changes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Relationship to Other MIBs</h3></a>

   It is assumed that an agent implementing MAU-MIB will also implement
   (at least) the 'system' group defined in the SNMPv2 MIB [RFC3418].
   The following sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should
   implement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   Relationship to the Interfaces MIB</h4></a>

   The sections of this document that define interface MAU-related
   objects specify an extension to the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  An
   agent implementing these interface-MAU related objects MUST also
   implement the relevant groups of the ifCompliance3 MODULE-COMPLIANCE
   statement of the Interface MIB.  The value of the object ifMauIfIndex
   is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to instantiate the
   interface to which the given MAU is connected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is REQUIRED that an agent implementing the interface-MAU related
   objects in the MAU-MIB will also fully comply with the
   dot3Compliance2 MODULE-COMPLIANCE statement of the Ethernet-like
   Interfaces MIB, [RFC3635].  Furthermore, when the interface-MAU
   related objects are used to manage a 10GBASE-W PHY -- i.e., when
   ifMauType is equal to dot3MauType10GigBaseW or any other 10GBASE-W
   variant -- then the agent MUST also support the Ethernet WAN
   Interface Sublayer (WIS) MIB [RFC3637] and must follow the interface
   layering model specified therein.  In that case the value of the
   object ifMauIfIndex is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' for the
   layer at the top of the stack, i.e., for the ifTable entry that has
   'ifType' equal to ethernetCsmacd(6).  If the interface-MAU related<br>
   objects are used to manage a PHY that allows the MAU type to be
   changed dynamically, then the agent SHALL create ifTable,
   ifStackTable, and ifInvStackTable entries that pertain to the WIS
   when ifMauDefaultType is changed to a 10GBASEW variant (i.e., one of
   dot3MauType10GigBaseW, dot3MauType10GigBaseEW,
   dot3MauType10GigBaseLW, or dot3MauType10GigBaseSW) from any other
   type, and shall destroy the WIS-related entries when ifMauDefaultType
   is changed to a non- 10GBASE-W type.  The agent SHALL also change the
   values of 'ifConnectorPresent' and 'ifHighSpeed' in the ifTable entry
   indexed by ifMauIfIndex as specified in [RFC3635] and [RFC3637] when
   ifMauDefaultType is manipulated in this way, but SHALL NOT otherwise
   alter that entry.
   (Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the
   Interface MIB.)

	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2   Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB Module</h4></a>

   The section of this document that defines repeater MAU-related
   objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in
   [RFC2108].  An agent implementing these repeater-MAU related objects
   MUST also comply with the snmpRptrModCompl compliance statement of
   the 802.3 Repeater MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to
   instantiate a repeater MAU variable SHALL be the same as the values
   of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the
   port that the given MAU is connected to.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Management of Internal MAUs</h3></a>

   In some situations, a MAU can be "internal" -- i.e., its
   functionality is implemented entirely within a device.  For example,
   a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater-MAU and/or an
   internal interface-MAU through which management communications
   originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass, in order to
   reach the management agent associated with the repeater.  Such
   internal MAUs may or may not be managed.  If they are managed,
   objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate
   MIB subtree: dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater-MAUs and
   dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface-MAUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Mapping of IEEE 802.3 Managed Objects</h3></a>

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [IEEE802.3] Clause 30, and managed objects

                   This resulted in the following revisions:
                   - Added OBJECT-IDENTITY definitions for
                     10 gigabit MAU types
                   - Added fiberLC jack type to JackType TC
                   - Extended ifMauTypeListBits with bits for
                     the 10 gigabit MAU types
                   - Added enumerations to ifMauMediaAvailable,
                     and updated its DESCRIPTION to reflect
                     behaviour at 10 Gb/s
                   - Added 64-bit version of ifMauFalseCarriers
                     and added mauIfGrpHCStats object group to
                     contain the new object
                   - Deprecated mauModIfCompl2 and replaced it
                     with mauModIfCompl3, which includes the new

         If the MAU is a 10M b/s link or fiber type (FOIRL, 10BASE-T,
         10BASE-F), then this is equivalent to the link test fail
         state/low light function.  For an AUI, 10BASE2, 10BASE5, or
         10BROAD36 MAU, this indicates whether loopback is detected on
         the DI circuit.  The value of this attribute persists between
         packets for MAU types AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and
         10BASEFP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         At power-up or following a reset, the Media Available state
         will be unknown(2) for AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and<br>
         10BASE-FP MAUs.  For these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
         transmission during which no collision is detected.
         If DI is receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a
         transmission and there has been no collision during the
         transmission, then loopback will be detected.  The Media
         Available state will only change during noncollided
         transmissions for AUI, 10BASE2, 10BASE5, 10BROAD36, and
         10BASE-FP MAUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For 100BASE-T2, 100BASE-T4, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX,
         100BASE-LX10, and 100BASE-BX10 PHYs the enumerations match the
         states within the link integrity state diagram.
         Any MAU that implements management of [IEEE802.3] Clause
         28 Auto-Negotiation, will map remote fault indication to
         remoteFault(5).<br>
         Any MAU that implements management of Clause 37
         Auto-Negotiation, will map the received RF1 and RF2 bits as
         follows: Offline maps to offline(10), Link_Failure maps to<br>
         remoteFault(5), and Auto-Negotiation Error maps to<br>
         autoNegError(11).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The value remoteFault(5) applies to 10BASE-FB remote<br>
         fault indication, the 100BASE-X far-end fault indication, and
         nonspecified remote faults from a system running Clause 28
         Auto-Negotiation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The value remoteJabber(7), remoteLink loss(8), or remoteTest(9)<br>
         SHOULD be used instead of remoteFault(5) where the reason for<br>
         remote fault is identified in the remote signaling protocol.
         Where a Clause 22 MII or Clause 35 GMII is present, a logic
         one in the remote fault bit maps to the value remoteFault(5),<br>
         a logic zero in the link status bit maps to the enumeration

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The IANA-MAU-MIB does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which are used by the MAU-MIB
   and may be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.
   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define management objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are a number of management objects defined in the MAU-MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Setting these objects can
   have a serious effect on the operation of the network, including:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  enabling or disabling a MAU

   o  changing a MAU's default type

   o  enabling, disabling, or restarting autonegotiation

   o  modifying the capabilities that a MAU advertizes during
      autonegotiation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some of the readable objects in the MAU-MIB module (i.e., objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  In some
   environments, it may be undesirable to allow unauthorized parties to
   access statistics or status information about individual links in a
   network.  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in the MAU-MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of the MAU-MIB module is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document defines first version of the IANA-maintained IANA-MAU-
   MIB module.  It is intended that each new MAU type, Media Available
   state, Auto Negotiation capability, and/or Jack type defined by the
   IEEE 802.3 working group and approved for publication in a revision
   of IEEE Std 802.3 will be added to the IANA-maintaned MIB module,
   provided that it is suitable for being managed by the base objects in
   the MAU-MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For each new MAU type added, a short description of the MAU
   technology and, wherever possible, a reference to a publicly
   available specification SHOULD be specified.  An Expert Review, as
   defined in RFC 2434 [RFC2434], is REQUIRED, for each modification.

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC 3636
   [RFC3636], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard, and produced by
   the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extends that
   document by moving the object identities and textual conventions for
   MAU types into a IANA-maintained MIB module.  In addition, support is
   provided for the EFM and 10GBASE-CX4 MAUs as defined in [IEEE802.3ah]
   and [IEEE802.3ak] respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 3636, in turn, was based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC
   2668 [RFC2668], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard and Andrew
   Smith, then of Extreme Networks, and produced by the Ethernet
   Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extends that document by
   providing support for 10 Gb/s MAUs as defined in [IEEE802.3ae].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 2668, in turn, was based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC
   2239 [RFC2239], edited by Kathryn de Graaf, then of 3Com, and Dan
   Romascanu, then of Madge Networks, and produced by the Ethernet
   Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extended that document by
   providing support for 1000 Mb/sec MAUs, PAUSE negotiation and remote
   fault status as defined in [IEEE802.3].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 2239, in turn, was based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC
   1515 [RFC1515], edited by Donna McMaster, then of SynOptics
   Communications, Keith McCloghrie, then of Hughes LAN Systems, and Sam
   Roberts, then of Farallon Computing, and produced by the Hub MIB
   Working Group.  It extends that document by providing support for 100
   Mb/sec MAUs, full duplex MAUs, auto-negotiation, and jack management
   as defined in [IEEE802.3].
