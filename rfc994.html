   This Protocol Standard is one of a set of International Standards
   produced to facilitate the interconnection of open systems. The set
   of standards covers the services and protocols required to achieve
   such interconnection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This Protocol Standard is positioned with respect to other related
   standards by the layers defined in the Reference Model for Open Sys-
   tems Interconnection (ISO 7498).  In particular, it is a protocol of
   the Network Layer. This Protocol may be used between network-entities
   in end systems or in Network Layer relay systems (or both).  It pro-
   vides the Connectionless-mode Network Service as defined in Addendum
   1 to the Network Service Definition Covering Connectionless-mode
   Transmission (ISO 8348/AD1).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The interrelationship of these standards is illustrated in Figure 1

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.      Scope and Field of Application</h2></a>

   This International Standard specifies a protocol which is used to
   provide the Connectionless-mode Network Service as described in Ad-
   dendum 1 to the Network Service Definition Covering Connectionless-
   mode Transmission.  The protocol relies upon the provision of an
   underlying connectionless-mode service by real subnetworks and/or
   data links. The underlying connectionless-mode service assumed by the
   protocol may be obtained either directly, from a connectionless-mode
   real subnetwork, or indirectly, through the operation of an appropri-
   ate Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Function (SNDCF) or Protocol
   (SNDCP) over a connection-mode real subnetwork as described in ISO
   8648, Internal Organization of the Network Layer.
      This Standard specifies:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      a)  procedures for the connectionless transmission of data and
          control information from one network-entity to a peer
          network-entity;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      b)  the encoding of the protocol data units (PDUs) used for the
          transmission of data and control information, comprising a
          variable-length protocol header format;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      c)  procedures for the correct interpretation of protocol control
          information; and

      d)  the functional requirements for implementations claiming
          conformance to the Standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The procedures are defined in terms of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      a)  the interactions among peer network-entities through the
          exchange of protocol data units;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      b)  the interactions between a network-entity and a Network Service
          user through the exchange of Network Service primitives; and

      c)  the interactions between a network-entity and an underlying
          service provider through the exchange of service primitives.

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1    Internal Organization of the Network Layer</h3></a>

   The architectural organization of the Network Layer is described in a
   separate document, Internal Organization of the Network Layer (ISO
   8648). ISO 8648 identifies and categorizes the way in which functions
   can be performed within the Network Layer by Network Layer protocols,
   thus providing a uniform framework for describing how protocols
   operating either individually or cooperatively in the Network Layer
   can be used to provide the OSI Network Service. This protocol is
   designed to be used in the context of the internetworking protocol
   approach to the provision of the Connectionless-mode Network Service
   defined in that Standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This protocol is intended for use in the Subnetwork Independent Con-
   vergence Protocol (SNICP) role.  A protocol which fulfills the SNICP
   role operates to construct the OSI Network Service over a defined set
   of underlying services, performing functions which are necessary to
   support the uniform appearance of the OSI Connectionless-mode Network
   Service over a homogeneous or heterogeneous set of interconnected
   subnetworks.  This protocol is defined to accommodate variability
   where Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Protocols and/or Subnetwork
   Access Protocols do not provide all of the functions necessary to
   support the Connectionless-mode Network Service over all or part of
   the path from one NSAP to another.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As described in ISO 8648, a protocol at the Network Layer may fulfill
   different roles in different configurations.  Although this protocol
   is designed particularly to be suitable for a SNICP role in the con-
   text of the internetworking protocol approach to the provision of the
   Connectionless-mode Network Service, it may also be used to fulfill
   other roles and may therefore be used in the context of other ap-
   proaches to subnetwork interconnection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The specification of this protocol begins with a definition of the
   underlying service which it assumes. This service is made available
   by the operation of other Network Layer protocols or through provi-
   sion of the Data Link Service. The underlying service assumed by this
   protocol is described in Clause 5.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2      Subsets of the Protocol</h3></a>

   Two proper subsets of the full protocol are defined which permit the
   use of known subnetwork characteristics and are therefore not subnet-
   work independent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Inactive Network Layer protocol subset is a null-function subset
   which can be used when it is known that the source and destination
   end-systems are connected by a single subnetwork, and when none of
   the functions performed by the full protocol is required to provide
   the Connectionless-mode Network Service between any pair of end-
   systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Non-segmenting protocol subset permits simplification of the
   header where it is known that the source and destination end-systems
   are connected by subnetworks whose service data unit sizes are
   greater than or equal to a known bound which is large enough so that
   segmentation is not required. This subset is selected by setting the
   Segmentation Permitted flag to zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3      Addresses and Titles</h3></a>

   The following Clauses describe the addresses and titles used by this
   Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.1"><h4>5.3.1     Addresses</h4></a>

   The Source Address and Destination Address parameters referred to in
   Clause 7.3 of this International Standard are OSI Network Service Ac-
   cess Point Addresses.  The syntax and semantics of an OSI Network
   Service Access Point Address are described in a separate document,
   ISO 8348/AD2, Addendum to the Network Service Definition Covering
   Network Layer Addressing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding used by this protocol to convey NSAP Addresses shall be
   the preferred binary encoding specified in ISO 8348/AD2; the entire
   NSAP address, taken as a whole, is represented explicitly as a string
   of binary octets.  This string is conveyed in its entirety in the ad-
   dress fields described in Clause 7.3. The rules governing the genera-
   tion of the preferred binary encoding are described in ISO 8348/AD2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.2"><h4>5.3.2     Network-entity Titles</h4></a>

   A network-entity title is an identifier for a network-entity in an
   endsystem or intermediate-system. Network-entity titles are allocated
   from the same name space as NSAP addresses, and the determination of
   whether an address is an NSAP address or a network-entity title
   depends on the context in which the address is interpreted. The en-
   tries in the Source Routing and Recording of Route parameters defined
   in Clauses 7.5.4 and 7.5.5 are network-entity titles. The Source Ad-
   dress and Destination Address parameters in the Error Report PDU de-
   fined in Clause 7.9.1.2 are also network-entity titles.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding used by this protocol to convey network-entity titles
   shall also be the preferred binary encoding; again, the entire
   network-entity title, taken as a whole, is represented explicitly as
   a string of binary octets.  This string is conveyed in its entirety
   in the fields described in Clauses 7.5.4, 7.5.5, and 7.9.1.2.
	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4      Service Provided by the Network Layer</h3></a>

   The service provided by this protocol is the Connectionless-mode Net-
   work Service described in ISO 8348/AD1, Addendum to the Network Ser-
   vice Definition Covering Connectionless-mode Transmission.  The Net-
   work Service primitives provided are summarized in Table 1:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           _____________________________________________________________
          |             PRIMITIVES                    PARAMETERS        |

          |  N_UNITDATA         .Request    |  N_Source_Address,        |

          |_________________________________|___________________________|

               Table 1: Service Primitives for Underlying Service


   The Addendum to the Network Service Definition Covering
   Connectionless-mode Transmission (ISO 8348/AD1) states that the max-
   imum size of a connectionless-mode Network-service-data-unit (NSDU)
   is limited to 64512 octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5      Underlying Service Assumed by the Protocol</h3></a>

   The underlying service required to support this protocol is defined
   by the following primitives:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           _____________________________________________________________
          |             PRIMITIVES                    PARAMETERS        |

          |  SN_UNITDATA        .Request    | SN_Source_Address,        |

          |_________________________________|___________________________|

               Table 2: Service Primitives for Underlying Service


                                   Note:
   These service primitives are used to describe the abstract interface
   which exists between the ISO 8473 protocol machine and an underlying
   real subnetwork or a Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Function which
   operates over a real subnetwork or real data link to provide the
   required underlying service.
	<a name="section-5.5.1"><h4>5.5.1     Subnetwork Points of Attachment</h4></a>

   The source and destination addresses specify the points of attachment
   to a public or private subnetwork(s) involved in the transmission.
   Subnetwork Point of Attachment addresses (SNPAs) are defined by each
   individual subnetwork authority.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax and semantics of SNPAs are not defined in this Standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5.2"><h4>5.5.2     Subnetwork Quality of Service</h4></a>

   Subnetwork Quality of Service describes aspects of an underlying
   connectionless-mode service which are attributable solely to the
   underlying service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Associated with each connectionless-mode transmission, certain meas-
   ures of Quality of Service are requested when the primitive action is
   initiated.  These requested measures (or parameter values and op-
   tions) are based on a priori knowledge of the service(s) made avail-
   able to it by the subnetwork. Knowledge of the nature and type of
   service available is typically obtained prior to an invocation of the
   underlying connectionless-mode service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Quality of Service parameters identified for the underlying
   connectionless-mode service may in some circumstances be directly
   derivable from or mappable onto those identified in the
   Connectionless-mode Network Service.  The following parameters as de-
   fined in ISO 8348/AD1, Addendum to the Network Service Definition
   Covering Connectionlessmode Transmission, may be employed:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     (a)  transit delay;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     (b)  protection against unauthorized access;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     (c)  cost determinants;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     (d)  priority; and

     (e)  residual error probability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
                                    Note:
        For those subnetworks which do not inherently provide Quality of
        Service as a parameter when the primitive action is initiated, it
        is a local matter as to how the semantics of the service requested
        might be preserved. In particular, there may be instances in which
        the Quality of Service requested cannot be maintained.  In such
        circumstances, an attempt shall be made to deliver the protocol
        data unit at whatever Quality of Service is available.
	<a name="section-5.5.3"><h4>5.5.3     Subnetwork User Data</h4></a>

   The SN-Userdata is an ordered multiple of octets, and is transferred
   transparently between the specified subnetwork points of attachment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The underlying service assumed by the CLNP is required to support a
   service data unit size of at least 512 octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the minimum service data unit sizes supported by all of the sub-
   networks involved in the transmission of a particular PDU are known
   to be large enough that segmentation is not required, then the Non-
   segmenting protocol subset may be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-5.5.4"><h4>5.5.4     Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Functions</h4></a>

   Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Functions may be performed to pro-
   vide an underlying connectionless-mode service in the case where a
   real subnetwork does not inherently provide the connectionless-mode
   service assumed by the protocol.  If a subnetwork inherently provides
   a connection-mode service, a Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Func-
   tion provides a mapping into the required underlying service.  Sub-
   network Dependent Convergence Functions may also be required in those
   cases where functions assumed from the underlying service are not
   performed.  In some cases, this may require the operation of an ex-
   plicit protocol (i.e., a protocol involving explicit exchanges of
   protocol control information between peer network-entities) in the
   Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Protocol (SNDCP) role. However,
   there may also be cases where the functionality required to fulfill
   the SNDCP role consists simply of a set of rules for manipulating the
   underlying service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6      Service Assumed from Local Environment</h3></a>

   A timer service must be provided to allow the protocol entity to
   schedule events.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are three primitives associated with the S-TIMER service:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1.  the S--TIMER Request,
      2.  the S--TIMER Response, and
      3.  the S--TIMER Cancel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The S--TIMER Request primitive indicates to the local environment
   that it should initiate a timer of the specified name and subscript
   and maintain it for the duration specified by the time parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The S--TIMER Response primitive is initiated by the local environment
   to indicate that the delay requested by the corresponding S-TIMER Re-
   quest primitive has elapsed.
   The S--TIMER Cancel primitive is an indication to the local environ-
   ment that the specified timer(s) should be canceled. If the subscript
   parameter is not specified, then all timers with the specified name
   are canceled; otherwise, the timer of the given name and subscript is
   cancelled.  If no timers correspond to the parameters specified, the
   local environment takes no action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The parameters of the S--TIMER service primitives are specified in
   Table 3.

   The time parameter indicates the time duration of the specified ti-
   mer.  An identifiying label is associated with a timer by means of
   the name parameter. The subscript parameter specifies a value to dis-
   tinguish timers with the same name. The name and subscript taken to-
   gether constitute a unique reference to the timer.

              SECTION  TWO.  SPECIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL


	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.      Protocol Functions</h2></a>

   This Clause describes the functions performed as part of the Proto-
   col.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Not all of the functions must be performed by every implementation.
   Clause 6.17 specifies which functions may be omitted, and the correct
   behavior when requested functions are not implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1      PDU Composition Function</h3></a>

   This function is responsible for the construction of a protocol data
   unit according to the rules governing the encoding of PDUs given in
   Clause 7.  Protocol Control Information required for delivering the
   data unit to its destination is determined from current state and lo-
   cal information and from the parameters associated with the N-
   UNITDATA Request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Network Protocol Address Information (NPAI) for the Source Address
   and Destination Address fields of the PDU header is derived from the
   NS-Source-Address and NS-Destination-Address parameters. The NS-
   Destination-Address and NS-Quality-of-Service parameters, together
   with current state and local information, are used to determine which
   optional functions are to be selected. User data passed from the Net-
   work Service User (NS-Userdata) forms the Data field of the protocol
   data unit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   During the composition of the protocol data unit, a Data Unit Iden-
   tifier is assigned to distinguish this request to transmit NS-
   Userdata to a particular destination NS User from other such re-
   quests. The originator of the PDU must choose the Data Unit Identif-
   ier so that it remains unique (for this Source and Destination ad-
   dress pair) for the maximum lifetime of the Initial PDU in the net-
   work; this rule applies for any PDUs derived from the Initial PDU as
   a result of the application of the Segmentation Function (see Clause
   6.7).  Derived PDUs are considered to correspond to the same Initial
   PDU, and hence the same N-UNITDATA Request, if they have the same
   Source Address, Destination Address, and Data Unit Identifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Data Unit Identifier is also available for ancillary functions
   such as error reporting (see Clause 6.10).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The total length of the PDU in octets is determined by the originator
   and placed in the Total Length field of the PDU header. This field is
   not changed in any Derived PDU for the lifetime of the protocol data
   unit.
   When the Non-segmenting protocol subset is employed, neither the To-
   tal Length field nor the Data Unit Identifier field is present.  The
   rules governing the PDU composition function are modified in this
   case as follows. During the composition of the protocol data unit,
   the total length of the PDU in octets is determined by the originator
   and placed in the Segment Length field of the PDU header. This field
   is not changed for the lifetime of the PDU. No Data Unit Identifica-
   tion is provided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2      PDU Decomposition Function</h3></a>

   This function is responsible for removing the Protocol Control Infor-
   mation from the protocol data unit.  During this process, information
   pertinent to the generation of the N-UNITDATA Indication is deter-
   mined as follows. The NS-Source-Address and NS-Destination-Address
   parameters of the N-UNITDATA Indication are recovered from the NPAI
   in the Source and Destination Address fields of the PDU header. The
   data field of the PDU received is reserved until all segments of the
   original service data unit have been received; collectively, these
   form the NS-Userdata parameter of the N-UNITDATA Indication.  Infor-
   mation relating to the Quality of Service provided during the
   transmission of the PDU is determined from the Quality of Service and
   other information contained in the Options Part of the PDU header.
   This information constitutes the NS-Quality-of-Service parameter of
   the N-UNITDATA Indication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3      Header Format Analysis Function</h3></a>

   This function determines whether the full protocol described in this
   Standard is employed, or one of the defined proper subsets thereof.
   If the protocol data unit has a Network Layer Protocol Identifier in-
   dicating that this is a standard version of the Protocol, this func-
   tion determines whether a received PDU has reached its destination,
   using the Destination Address provided in the PDU. If the Destination
   Address provided in the PDU identifies an NSAP served by this
   network-entity, then the PDU has reached its destination; if not, it
   must be forwarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the protocol data unit has a Network Layer Protocol Identifier in-
   dicating that the Inactive Network Layer Protocol subset is in use,
   then no further analysis of the PDU header is required. The network-
   entity in this case determines that either the Subnetwork Point of
   Attachment address encoded as network protocol address information in
   the supporting subnetwork protocol corresponds directly to an NSAP
   address serviced by this network-entity or that an error has oc-
   curred. If the subnetwork protocol data unit has been delivered
   correctly, then the PDU may be decomposed according to the procedures
   described for that particular subnetwork protocol.
	<a name="section-6.4"><h3>6.4      PDU Lifetime Control Function</h3></a>

   This function is used to enforce the maximum PDU lifetime. It is
   closely associated with the Header Format Analysis function.  This
   function determines whether a PDU received may be forwarded or wheth-
   er its assigned lifetime has expired, in which case it must be dis-
   carded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The operation of the PDU Lifetime Control function depends upon the
   Lifetime field in the PDU header.  This field contains, at any time,
   the remaining lifetime of the PDU (represented in units of 500 mil-
   liseconds). The Lifetime of the Initial PDU is determined by the ori-
   ginating network-entity, and placed in the Lifetime field of the PDU.
   When the Segmentation function is applied to a PDU, the value of the
   Lifetime field of the Initial PDU is copied into all of the Derived
   PDUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Lifetime of the PDU is decremented by every network-entity which
   processes the PDU. When a network-entity processes a PDU, it decre-
   ments the PDU Lifetime by at least one.  The value of the PDU Life-
   time field shall be decremented by more than one if the sum of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1.  the transit delay in the underlying service from which the PDU
          was received; and

      2.  the delay within the system processing the PDU

   exceeds or is estimated to exceed 500 milliseconds.  In this case,
   the lifetime field should be decremented by one for each additional
   500 milliseconds of delay. The determination of delay need not be
   precise, but where a precise value cannot be ascertained, the value
   used shall be an overestimate, not an underestimate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the Lifetime field reaches a value of zero before the PDU is
   delivered to the destination, the PDU must be discarded.  The Error
   Reporting function shall be invoked as described in Clause 6.10, Er-
   ror Reporting Function, and may result in the generation of an Error
   Report PDU.  It is a local matter whether the destination network-
   entity performs the Lifetime Control function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5"><h3>6.5      Route PDU Function</h3></a>

   This function determines the network-entity to which a protocol data
   unit should be forwarded and the underlying service that must be used
   to reach that network-entity, using the Destination Address and the
   total length of the PDU. Where segmentation is required, the Route
   PDU function further determines over which underlying service Derived
   PDUs/segments must be sent in order to reach that network-entity. The
   results of the Route PDU function are passed to the Forward PDU func-
   tion (along with the PDU itself) for further processing.  Selection
   of the underlying service that must be used to reach the "next" sys-
   tem in the route is initially influenced by the NS-Quality-of- Ser-
   vice parameter of the N-UNITDATA Request, which specifies the QoS re-
   quested by the sending NS User. Whether this QoS is to be provided
   directly by the CLNP, through the selection of the Quality of Service
   Maintenance parameter and other optional parameters, or through the
   QoS facilities offered by each of the underlying services is deter-
   mined prior to invocation of the Forward PDU function.  Route selec-
   tion by intermediate systems may subsequently be influenced by the
   values of the Quality of Service Maintenance parameter (if present),
   and other optional parameters (if present).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.6"><h3>6.6      Forward PDU Function</h3></a>

   This function issues an SN-UNITDATA Request primitive (see Clause
   5.5), supplying the subnetwork or SNDCF identified by the Route PDU
   function with the protocol data unit as user data to be transmitted,
   the address information required by that subnetwork or SNDCF to iden-
   tify the "next" system within the subnetwork-specific addressing
   domain (this may be an intermediate-system or the destination end-
   system), and Quality of Service constraints (if any) to be considered
   in the processing of the user data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the PDU to be forwarded is longer than the maximum service data
   user size provided by the underlying service, the Segmentation func-
   tion is applied (See Clause 6.7, which follows).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.7"><h3>6.7      Segmentation Function</h3></a>

   Segmentation is performed when the size of the protocol data unit is
   greater than the maximum service data unit size supported by the
   underlying service to be used to transmit the PDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Segmentation consists of composing two or more new PDUs (Derived
   PDUs) from the PDU received. The PDU received may be the Initial PDU,
   or it may be a Derived PDU. All of the header information from the
   PDU to be segmented, with the exception of the segment length and
   checksum fields of the fixed part, and the segment offset of the seg-
   mentation part, is duplicated in each Derived PDU, including all of
   the address part, the data unit identifier and total length of the
   segmentation part, and the options part (if present).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                   Note:
       The rules for forwarding and segmentation guarantee that the
       header length is the same for all segments (Derived PDUs) of
       the Initial PDU, and is the same as the header length of the
       Initial PDU.  The size of a PDU header will not change due to
       operation of any protocol function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The user data encapsulated within the PDU received are divided such
   that the Derived PDUs satisfy the size requirements of the user data
   parameter field of the primitive used to access the underlying ser-
   vice.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Derived PDUs are identified as being from the same Initial PDU by
   means of

     (a)  the source address,

     (b)  the destination address, and

     (c)  the data unit identifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Segmentation shall not result in the generation of a Derived PDU con-
   taining less than eight (8) octets of user data.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following fields of the PDU header are used in conjunction with
   the Segmentation function:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (a)  Segment Offset --- identifies, with respect to the start
           of the Initial PDU, the octet at which the segment begins;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (b)  Segment Length --- specifies the number of octets in the
           Derived PDU, including both header and data;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (c)  More Segments Flag --- is set to one if this Derived PDU
           does not contain, as its final octet of user data, the final
           octet of the Initial PDU; and

      (d)  Total Length --- specifies the entire length of the Initial
           PDU, including both header and data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   Derived PDUs may be further segmented without constraining the rout-
   ing of the individual Derived PDUs.  The Segmentation Permitted flag
   is set to one to indicate that segmentation is permitted. If the Ini-
   tial PDU is not to be segmented at any point during its lifetime in
   the network, the flag is set to zero by the source network-entity.
   The setting of the Segmentation Permitted flag cannot be changed by
   any other network-entity for the lifetime of the Initial PDU and any
   Derived PDUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.8"><h3>6.8      Reassembly Function</h3></a>

   The Reassembly function reconstructs the Initial PDU from the Derived
   PDUs generated by the operation of the Segmentation Function on the
   Initial PDU (and, recursively, on subsequent Derived PDUs).  A bound
   on the time during which segments (Derived PDUs) of an Initial PDU
   will be held at a reassembly point before being discarded is provid-
   ed, so that reassembly resources may be released when it is no longer
   expected that any outstanding segments of the Initial PDU will arrive
   at the reassembly point. Upon reception of a Derived PDU, a reassem-
   bly timer is initiated with a value which indicates the amount of
   time which must elapse before any outstanding segments of the Initial
   PDU shall be assumed to be lost.  When this timer expires, all seg-
   ments (Derived PDUs) of the Initial PDU held at the reassembly point
   are discarded, the resources allocated for those segments are freed,
   and if selected, an Error Report is generated (see Clause 6.10).
   While the exact relationship between reassembly lifetime and PDU
   lifetime is a local matter, the Reassembly Function must preserve the
   intent of the PDU lifetime. Consequently, the reassembly function
   must discard PDUs whose lifetime would otherwise have expired had
   they not been under the control of the reassembly function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                   Note:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         1. Methods of bounding reassembly lifetime are discussed in
            Annex B.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         2. The Segmentation and Reassembly functions are intended to
            be used in such a way that the fewest possible segments are
            generated at each segmentation point and reassembly takes
            place at the final destination of a PDU. However, other
            schemes which

             (a) interact with the routing algorithm to favor paths on
                 which fewer segments are generated;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             (b) generate more segments than absolutely required in
                 order to avoid additional segmentation at some subsequent
                 point; or

             (c) allow partial or full reassembly at some intermediate
                 point along the route

            are not precluded. The information necessary to enable the
            use of one of these alternative strategies may be made
            available through the operation of a Network Layer Management
            function or by other means.

            system (Note 2 (c) above) cannot change this value in the
            Initial PDU or any PDU derived from it, and cannot therefore

   The PDU Header Error Detection function protects against failure of
   intermediate or end-system network-entities due to the processing of
   erroneous information in the PDU header.  The function is realized by
   a checksum computed on the entire PDU header. The checksum is veri-
   fied at each point at which the PDU header is processed.  If the
   checksum calculation fails, the PDU must be discarded.  If PDU header
   fields are modified (for example, due to operation of the lifetime

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.14"><h3>6.14      Source Routing Function</h3></a>

   The Source Routing function allows the originator to specify the path
   a generated PDU must take. Source routing may only be selected by the
   originator of a PDU. Source Routing is accomplished using a list of
   network-entity titles held in a parameter within the options part of
   the PDU header.  The length of this parameter is determined by the
   originating network-entity, and does not change as the PDU traverses
   the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Source Route parameter includes information used by the originat-
   ing end-system when determining the initial route of the PDU. Only
   the titles of intermediate system network-entities are included in
   the list; the network-entity title of the destination of the PDU is
   not included in the list.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Associated with the list of network-entity titles is an indicator
   which identifies the next entry in the list to be used; this indica-
   tor is advanced by the receiver of the PDU when the next title in the
   list matches its own. The indicator is updated as the PDU is forward-
   ed so as to identify the appropriate entry at each stage of relaying.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two forms of the Source Routing function are provided.  The first
   form, referred to as Complete Source Routing, requires that the
   specified path must be taken; that is, only those systems identified
   in the list may be visited by the PDU while en route to the destina-
   tion, and each system must be visited in the order specified. If the
   specified path cannot be taken, the PDU must be discarded. Clause
   6.10 describes the circumstances in which an attempt shall be made to
   inform the originator of the discard using the Error Reporting func-
   tion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second form is referred to as Partial Source Routing. Again, each
   system identified in the list must be visited in the order specified
   while en route to the destination.  However, with this form of source
   routing the PDU may take any path necessary to arrive at the next in-
   termediate system in the list, which may include visiting intermedi-
   ate systems that are not identified in the list. The PDU will not be
   discarded (for source routing related reasons) unless one of the sys-
   tems specified cannot be reached by any available route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.15"><h3>6.15      Record Route Function</h3></a>

   The Record Route function records the path(s) taken by a PDU as it
   traverses a series of intermediate systems. A recorded route consists
   of a list of network-entity titles held in a parameter within the op-
   tions part of the PDU header. The length of this parameter is deter-
   mined by the originating network-entity, and does not change as the
   PDU traverses the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The list is constructed as the PDU is forwarded along a path towards
   its destination.  Only the titles of intermediate system network-
   entities are included in the recorded route. The network-entity title
   of the originator of the PDU is not recorded in the list.
   When an intermediate system network-entity processes a PDU containing
   the Record Route parameter, the system adds its own networkentity ti-
   tle at the end of the list of recorded network-entity titles.  An in-
   dicator is maintained to identify the next available octet to be used
   for recording of route. This indicator is updated as entries are ad-
   ded to the list as follows. The length of the entry to be added to
   the list is added to the value of the next available octet indicator,
   and this sum is compared with the length of the Record Route parame-
   ter.  If the addition of the entry to the list would exceed the size
   of the parameter, the next available octet indicator is set to indi-
   cate that route recording has been terminated. The network-entity ti-
   tle is not added to the list. The PDU may still be forwarded to its
   final destination, without further addition of network-entity titles.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the addition of the entry would not exceed the size of the Record
   Route parameter, the next available octet indicator is updated with
   the new value, and the network-entity title is added to the head of
   the list after the other entries have been moved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two forms of the Record Route function are provided.  The first form
   is referred to as Complete Route Recording.  It requires that the
   list of network-entity titles be a complete and accurate record of
   all intermediate systems visited by a PDU (including Derived PDUs),
   except when a shortage of space in the record route option field
   causes termination of recording of route, as described above. When
   Complete Route Recording is selected, PDU reassembly at intermediate
   systems is performed only when the Derived PDUs that are reassembled
   all took the same route; otherwise, the PDU is discarded, and if
   selected, an Error Report is generated (see Clause 6.10).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second form is referred to as Partial Route Recording. It also
   requires a record of intermediate systems visited by a PDU. When Par-
   tial Route Recording is selected, PDU reassembly at intermediate sys-
   tems is always permitted.  When reassembly is performed at an inter-
   mediate system, the route recorded in any of the Derived PDUs may be
   placed in the PDU resulting from the reassembly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                   Note:
       The Record Route function is intended to be used in the diagnosis
       of subnetwork problems and/or to provide a return path that could
       be used as a source route in a subsequent PDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.16"><h3>6.16      Quality of Service Maintenance Function</h3></a>

   The Quality of Service Maintenance function provides information to
   network-entities in intermediate systems which may be used to make
   routing decisions where such decisions affect the overall QoS provid-
   ed to NS users. This information is conveyed to intermediate system
   network- entities in a parameter in the options part of the PDU
   header.
   In those instances where the QoS requested cannot be maintained, in-
   termediate system network-entities shall attempt to deliver the PDU
   at a QoS different from the QoS requested. Intermediate system
   network-entities do not necessarily provide a notification of failure
   to meet the requested Quality of Service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-6.17"><h3>6.17      Priority Function</h3></a>

   The Priority function allows a PDU with a numerically higher priority
   value to be processed preferentially with respect to other PDUs with
   numerically lower priority values. The function is realized through
   selection of a parameter in the options part of the PDU header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The lowest priority value is zero; a source network-entity that does
   not support the Priority function must set the Priority value to
   zero.  The Priority function provides a means whereby the resources
   of end and intermediate system network-entities, such as outgoing
   transmission queues and buffers, can be used preferentially to pro-
   cess higher-priority PDUs ahead of lower-priority PDUs. The specific
   action taken by an individual network-entity to support the Priority
   function is a local matter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.18"><h3>6.18      Congestion Notification Function</h3></a>

   To allow NS Users to take appropriate action when congestion is ex-
   perienced within the NS provider, intermediate systems may inform the
   destination network-entity of congestion through the use of a flag in
   the QoS Maintenance parameter in the options part of the PDU header.
   The value of this flag is initially set to zero (0) by the originator<br>
   of the PDU and may be set to one (1) by any intermediate system which<br>
   processes the PDU to indicate that it is experiencing congestion. The
   criteria for determining when this action is to be taken are a local
   matter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                    Note:
     Congestion typically corresponds to inavailability of buffer space
     to maintain output queues. An appropriate policy for indicating
     congestion may be based upon the depth of the output queue selected
     for a PDU (according to its destination address or other routing
     information). When the depth of a particular output queue exceeds
     a certain proportion of the depth of that queue, an intermediate
     system will start to discard PDUs. The intermediate system will set
     the Congestion Experienced flag in the next PDU to be forwarded
     and may continue to do so until the condition is alleviated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.19"><h3>6.19      Classification of Functions</h3></a>

   Implementations are not required to support all of the functions
   described in Clauses 6.1 through 6.18. Functions are divided into
   three categories:
   Type 1: These functions must be supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Type 2: These functions may or may not be supported.
           If an implementation does not support a Type 2 function, and the
           function is selected in a PDU, then that PDU must be discarded,
           and an Error Report PDU must be generated and forwarded to the
           originating network-entity, providing that the Error Report flag is
           set and the conditions of Clause 6.10.4 are satisfied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Type 3: These functions may or may not be supported.
           If an implementation does not support a Type 3 function, and the
           function is selected in a PDU, then the function is not performed,
           and the PDU is processed exactly as though the function had not
           been selected.  The protocol data unit shall not be discarded for
           this reason.

   cannot be changed by any other network-entity for the lifetime of the
   Initial PDU and any Derived PDUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A value of one (1) indicates that segmentation is permitted. A value<br>

   The parameter code field is coded in binary and, without extensions,
   provides a maximum of 255 different parameters.  No parameter codes
   use bits 8 and 7 with the value 00, so the actual maximum number of

                      Table 7: Reasons for Discard

   The first octet of the parameter value contains an error type code.
   If the error in the discarded Data PDU can be localized to a particu-
   lar field, the number of the first octet of that field is stored in
   the second octet of the reason for discard parameter field. If the
   error cannot be localized to a particular field, or if the error is a
   checksum error, then the value zero is stored in the second octet of
   the reason for discard parameter field.
<a name="section-7.9.1.5"><h4>7.9.1.5     Error Report Data Field</h4></a>
                    

   This field contains the entire header of the discarded Data PDU, and
   may contain some or all of the data field of the discarded PDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.      Conformance</h2></a>

   For conformance to this International Standard, the ability to ori-
   ginate, manipulate, and receive PDUs in accordance with the full pro-
   tocol (as opposed to the non-segmenting or Inactive Network Layer
   Protocol subsets) is required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, conformance to the Standard requires provision of the
   protocol functions described in Clause 6. Provision of the optional
   functions described in Clause 6.18 and enumerated in Table 9-1 must
   meet the requirements described therein. Exceptions to this require-
   ment are described in Clause 8.1 below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, conformance to the Standard requires adherence to the
   structure and encoding of PDUs of Clause 7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If and only if the above requirements are met is there conformance to
   this International Standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.1"><h3>8.1      Provision of Functions for Conformance</h3></a>

   The following table categorizes the functions in Clause 6 with
   respect to the type of system providing the function:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                    Note:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       1. The support of the PDU Composition and Forward PDU functions
          is necessary for the generation of Error Report PDUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       2. The Segment PDU function is in general mandatory for an
          intermediate system. However, a system which is to be
          connected only to subnetworks all offering the same maximum
          SDU size (such as identical Local Area Networks) will not
          need to perform this function and therefore does not need to
          implement it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          If this function is not implemented, this shall be stated
          as part of the specification of the implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       3. The correct treatment of the padding function requires no
          processing. A conforming implementation shall support the
          function, to the extent of ignoring this parameter wherever
          it may appear.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       4. This function may or may not be supported.  If an
          implementation does not support this function, and the
          function is selected in a PDU, then the PDU shall be discarded,
          and an ER PDU shall be generated and forwarded to the
          originating network-entity if the Error Report flag is set
          and the conditions of Clause 6.10.4 are satisfied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       5. This function may or may not be supported.  If an implementation
          does not support this function, and the function is selected
          in a PDU, then the function is not performed and the PDU is
          processed exactly as though the function had not been
          selected. The PDU shall not be discarded for this reason.
