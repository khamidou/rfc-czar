</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document defines the Call Processing Language (CPL), a language
   to describe and control Internet telephony services.  It is designed
   to be implementable on either network servers or user agents.  It is
   meant to be simple, extensible, easily edited by graphical clients,
   and independent of operating system or signalling protocol.  It is
   suitable for running on a server where users may not be allowed to
   execute arbitrary programs, as it has no variables, loops, or ability
   to run external programs.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Call Processing Language (CPL) is a language that can be used to
   describe and control Internet telephony services.  It is not tied to
   any particular signalling architecture or protocol; it is anticipated
   that it will be used with both the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [1] and H.323 [16].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CPL is powerful enough to describe a large number of services and
   features, but it is limited in power so that it can run safely in
   Internet telephony servers.  The intention is to make it impossible
   for users to do anything more complex (and dangerous) than describe
   Internet telephony services.  The language is not Turing-complete,
   and provides no way to write loops or recursion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CPL is also designed to be easily created and edited by graphical
   tools.  It is based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) [2], so
   parsing it is easy and many parsers for it are publicly available.
   The structure of the language maps closely to its behavior, so an
   editor can understand any valid script, even ones written by hand.
   The language is also designed so that a server can easily confirm the
   validity of a script when the server receives it, rather than
   discovering problems while a call is being processed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations of CPL are expected to take place both in Internet
   telephony servers and in advanced clients; both can usefully process
   and direct users' calls.  This document primarily addresses the usage
   in servers.  A mechanism will be needed to transport scripts between
   clients and servers; this document does not describe such a
   mechanism, but related documents will.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The framework and requirements for the CPL architecture are described
   in RFC 2824, "Call Processing Language Framework and Requirements"
   [17].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Conventions of This Document</h3></a>

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [3] and indicate requirement levels for compliant CPL
   implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Some paragraphs are indented, like this; they give motivations of
      design choices, advice to implementors, or thoughts on future
      development of or extensions to CPL.  They are not essential to
      the specification of the language, and are non-normative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Structure of CPL Scripts</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   High-level Structure</h3></a>

   A CPL script consists of two types of information: ancillary
   information about the script, and call processing actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A call processing action is a structured tree that describes the
   operations and decisions a telephony signalling server performs on a
   call set-up event.  There are two types of call processing actions:
   top-level actions and subactions.  Top-level actions are actions that
   are triggered by signalling events that arrive at the server.  Two
   top-level actions are defined: "incoming", the action performed when
   a call arrives whose destination is the owner of the script, and
   "outgoing", the action performed when a call arrives whose originator
   is the owner of the script.
   Subactions are actions which can be called from other actions.  CPL
   forbids subactions from being called recursively: see Section 8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ancillary information is information which is necessary for a server
   to correctly process a script, but which does not directly describe
   any operations or decisions.  Currently, no ancillary information is
   defined, but the section is reserved for use by extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Abstract Structure of a Call Processing Action</h3></a>

   Abstractly, a call processing action is described by a collection of
   nodes that describe operations that can be performed or decisions
   that can be made.  A node may have several parameters, which specify
   the precise behavior of the node; they usually also have outputs,
   which depend on the result of the decision or action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a graphical representation of a CPL action, see Figure 1.  Nodes
   and outputs can be thought of informally as boxes and arrows; CPL is
   designed so that actions can be conveniently edited graphically using
   this representation.  Nodes are arranged in a tree, starting at a
   single root node; outputs of nodes are connected to additional nodes.
   When an action is run, the action or decision described by the
   action's top-level node is performed; based on the result of that
   node, the server follows one of the node's outputs, and the
   subsequent node it points to is performed; this process continues
   until a node with no specified outputs is reached.  Because the graph
   is acyclic, this will occur after a bounded and predictable number of
   nodes are visited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an output to a node does not point to another node, it indicates
   that the CPL server should perform a node- or protocol-specific
   action.  Some nodes have specific default behavior associated with
   them; for others, the default behavior is implicit in the underlying
   signalling protocol, or can be configured by the administrator of the
   server.  For further details on this, see Section 10.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 1: Sample CPL Action: Graphical Version

	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Location Model</h3></a>

   For flexibility, one piece of information necessary for CPL is not
   given as node parameters: the set of locations to which a call is to
   be directed.  Instead, this set of locations is stored as an implicit
   global variable throughout the execution of a processing action (and
   its subactions).  This allows locations to be retrieved from external
   sources, filtered, and so forth, without requiring general language
   support for such operations (which could harm the simplicity and
   tractability of understanding the language).  The specific operations
   which add, retrieve, or filter location sets are given in Section 5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the incoming top-level call processing action, the location set
   is initialized to the empty set.  For the outgoing action, it is
   initialized to the destination address of the call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   XML Structure</h3></a>

   Syntactically, CPL scripts are represented by XML documents.  XML is
   thoroughly specified by the XML specification [2], and implementors
   of this specification should be familiar with that document.
   However, as a brief overview, XML consists of a hierarchical
   structure of tags; each tag can have a number of attributes.  It is
   visually and structurally very similar to HTML [18], as both
   languages are simplifications of the earlier and larger standard SGML
   [19].
   See Figure 2 for the XML document corresponding to the graphical
   representation of the CPL script in Figure 1.  Both nodes and outputs
   in CPL are represented by XML tags; parameters are represented by XML
   tag attributes.  Typically, node tags contain output tags, and vice-
   versa (with a few exceptions: see Sections 5.1, 5.3, 7.1, and 7.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The connection between the output of a node and another node is
   represented by enclosing the tag representing the pointed-to node
   inside the tag for the outer node's output.  Convergence (several
   outputs pointing to a single node) is represented by subactions,
   discussed further in Section 8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The higher-level structure of a CPL script is represented by tags
   corresponding to each piece of ancillary information, subactions, and
   top-level actions, in order.  This higher-level information is all
   enclosed in a special tag "cpl", the outermost tag of the XML
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A complete XML Schema for CPL is provided in Appendix C.  The
   remainder of the main sections of this document describe the
   semantics of CPL, while giving its syntax informally.  For the formal
   syntax, please see the appendix.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Script Structure: Overview</h2></a>

   As mentioned, a CPL script consists of ancillary information,
   subactions, and top-level actions.  The full syntax of the "cpl" node
   is given in Figure 3.

   Figure 3: Syntax of the top-level "cpl" tag

   Call processing actions, both top-level actions and subactions,
   consist of a tree of nodes and outputs.  Nodes and outputs are both
   described by XML tags.  There are four categories of CPL nodes:
   switches, which represent choices a CPL script can make, location
   modifiers, which add or remove locations from the location set,
   signalling operations, which cause signalling events in the
   underlying protocol, and non-signalling operations, which trigger
   behavior which does not effect the underlying protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Switches</h2></a>

   Switches represent choices a CPL script can make, based on either
   attributes of the original call request or items independent of the
   call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All switches are arranged as a list of conditions that can match a
   variable.  Each condition corresponds to a node output; the output
   points to the next node that should be executed if the condition is
   true.  The conditions are tried in the order they are presented in
   the script; the output corresponding to the first node to match is
   taken.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two special switch outputs that apply to every switch type.
   The output "not-present", which MAY occur anywhere in the list of

   is sometimes described by saying that the information is "absent".)
   The output "otherwise", which MUST be the last output specified if it
   is present, matches if no other condition matched.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If no condition matches and no "otherwise" output was present in the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Address Switches</h3></a>

   Address switches allow a CPL script to make decisions based on one of
   the addresses present in the original call request.  They are
   summarized in Figure 4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Node:  "address-switch"
       Outputs:  "address"         Specific addresses to match
    Parameters:  "field"           "origin", "destination",

                                   (also: "password" and "alias-type")

        Output:  "address"
    Parameters:  "is"              Exact match
                 "contains"        Substring match (for "display" only)
                 "subdomain-of"    Sub-domain match (for "host", "tel")

   Figure 4: Syntax of the "address-switch" node

   Address switches have two node parameters: "field" and "subfield".
   The mandatory "field" parameter allows the script to specify which
   address is to be considered for the switch: either the call's origin
   address (field "origin"), its current destination address (field
   "destination"), or its original destination (field "original-
   destination"), the destination the call had before any earlier
   forwarding was invoked.  Servers MAY define additional field values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The optional "subfield" specifies which part of the address is to be
   considered.  The possible subfield values are: "address-type",
   "user", "host", "port", "tel", and "display".  Additional subfield
   values MAY be defined for protocol-specific values.  (The subfield
   "password" is defined for SIP in Section 4.1.1; the subfield "alias-
   type" is defined for H.323 in Appendix B.1.)  If no subfield is
   specified, the "entire" address is matched; the precise meaning of
   this is defined for each underlying signalling protocol.  Servers MAY
   define additional subfield values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subfields are defined as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      address-type: This indicates the type of the underlying address,
            i.e., the URI scheme, if the address can be represented by a
            URI.  The types specifically discussed by this document are
            "sip", "tel", and "h323".  The address type is not case-
            sensitive.  It has a value for all defined address types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      user: This subfield of the address indicates, for e-mail style
            addresses, the user part of the address.  For a telephone
            number style address, it includes the subscriber number.
            This subfield is case-sensitive; it may be absent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      host: This subfield of the address indicates the Internet host
            name or IP address corresponding to the address, in host
            name, IPv4, or IPv6 [4] textual representation format.  Host
            names are compared as strings.  IP addresses are compared
            numerically.  (In particular, the presence or location of an
            IPv6 :: omitted-zero-bits block is not significant for
            matching purposes.)  Host names are never equal to IP
            addresses -- no DNS resolution is performed.  IPv4 addresses
            are never equal to IPv6 addresses, even if the IPv6 address
            is a v4-in-v6 embedding.  This subfield is not case
            sensitive, and may be absent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            For host names only, subdomain matching is supported with
            the "subdomain-of" match operator.  The "subdomain-of"
            operator ignores leading dots in the hostname or match
            pattern, if any.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      port: This subfield indicates the TCP or UDP port number of the
            address, numerically, in decimal format.  It is not case
            sensitive, as it MUST only contain decimal digits.  Leading
            zeros are ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      tel:  This subfield indicates a telephone subscriber number, if
            the address contains such a number.  It is not case
            sensitive (telephone numbers may contain the symbols 'A',
            'B', 'C', or 'D'), and may be absent.  It may be matched
            using the "subdomain-of" match operator.  Punctuation and
            separator characters in telephone numbers are discarded.
      display: This subfield indicates a "display name" or user-visible
            name corresponding to an address.  It is a Unicode string,
            and is matched using the case-insensitive algorithm
            described in Section 4.2.  The "contains" operator may be
            applied to it.  It may be absent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For any completely unknown subfield, the server MAY reject the script
   at the time it is submitted with an indication of the problem; if a
   script with an unknown subfield is executed, the server MUST consider
   the "not-present" output to be the valid one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "address" output tag may take exactly one of three possible
   parameters, indicating the kind of matching allowed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      is:   An output with this match operator is followed if the
            subfield being matched in the "address-switch" exactly
            matches the argument of the operator.  It may be used for
            any subfield, or for the entire address if no subfield was
            specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      subdomain-of: This match operator applies only for the subfields
            "host" and "tel".  In the former case, it matches if the
            hostname being matched is a subdomain of the domain given in
            the argument of the match operator; thus, subdomain-
            of="example.com" would match the hostnames "example.com",
            "research.example.com", and
            "zaphod.sales.internal.example.com".  IP addresses may be
            given as arguments to this operator; however, they only
            match exactly.  In the case of the "tel" subfield, the
            output matches if the telephone number being matched has a
            prefix that matches the argument of the match operator;
            subdomain-of="1212555" would match the telephone number "1
            212 555 1212."

      contains: This match operator applies only for the subfield
            "display".  The output matches if the display name being
            matched contains the argument of the match as a substring.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.1"><h4>4.1.1   Usage of "address-switch" with SIP</h4></a>

   For SIP, the "origin" address corresponds to the address in the
   "From" header, "destination" corresponds to the "Request-URI", and
   "original-destination" corresponds to the "To" header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "display" subfield of an address is the display-name part of the
   address, if it is present.  Because of SIP's syntax, the
   "destination" address field will never have a "display" subfield.
   The "address-type" subfield of an address is the URI scheme of that
   address.  Other address fields depend on that "address-type".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For SIP URIs, the "user", "host", and "port" subfields correspond to
   the "user," "host," and "port" elements of the URI syntax.  (Note
   that, following the definitions of RFC 3261 [1], a SIP URI which does
   not specify a port is not the same as an explicit port 5060; the
   former is indicated by an absent port subfield.)  The "tel" subfield
   is defined to be the "user" part of the URI, with visual separators
   stripped, if the "user=phone" parameter is given to the URI, or if
   the server is otherwise configured to recognize the user part as a
   telephone number.  An additional subfield, "password", is defined to
   correspond to the "password" element of the SIP URI, and is case-
   sensitive.  However, use of this field is NOT RECOMMENDED for general
   security reasons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For tel URLs, the "tel" and "user" subfields are the subscriber name;
   in the former case, visual separators are stripped.  The "host" and
   "port" subfields are both not present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For h323 URLs, subfields MAY be set according to the scheme described
   in Appendix B.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For other URI schemes, only the "address-type" subfield is defined by
   this specification; servers MAY set other pre-defined subfields, or
   MAY support additional subfields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If no subfield is specified for addresses in SIP messages, the string

   Figure 7: Syntax of the "time-switch" node

   Time switches are based closely on the specification of recurring
   intervals of time in the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core
   Object Specification (iCalendar COS), RFC 2445 [8].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This allows CPL scripts to be generated automatically from
      calendar books.  It also allows us to re-use the extensive
      existing work specifying time intervals.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If future standards-track documents are published that update or
   obsolete RFC 2445, any changes or clarifications those documents make
   to recurrence handling apply to CPL time-switches as well.
   An algorithm to determine whether an instant falls within a given
   recurrence is given in Appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "time-switch" tag takes two optional parameters, "tzid" and
   "tzurl", both of which are defined in RFC 2445 (Sections 4.8.3.1 and
   4.8.3.5 respectively).  The "tzid" is the identifying label by which
   a time zone definition is referenced.  If it begins with a forward
   slash (solidus), it references a to-be-defined global time zone
   registry; otherwise it is locally-defined at the server.  The "tzurl"
   gives a network location from which an up-to-date VTIMEZONE
   definition for the timezone can be retrieved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While "tzid" labels that do not begin with a forward slash are
   locally defined, it is RECOMMENDED that servers support at least the
   naming scheme used by the Olson Time Zone database [9].  Examples of
   timezone databases that use the Olson scheme are the zoneinfo files
   on most Unix-like systems, and the standard Java TimeZone class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers SHOULD resolve "tzid" and "tzurl" references to time zone
   definitions at the time the script is uploaded.  They MAY
   periodically refresh these resolutions to obtain the most up-to-date
   definition of a time zone.  If a "tzurl" becomes invalid, servers
   SHOULD remember the most recent valid data retrieved from the URL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a script is uploaded with a "tzid" and "tzurl" which the CPL
   server does not recognize or cannot resolve, it SHOULD diagnose and
   reject this at script upload time.  If neither "tzid" nor "tzurl" are
   present, all non-UTC times within this time switch should be
   interpreted as being "floating" times, i.e., that they are specified
   in the local timezone of the CPL server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Because of daylight-savings-time changes over the course of a
      year, it is necessary to specify time switches in a given
      timezone.  UTC offsets are not sufficient, or a time-of-day
      routing rule which held between 9 am and 5 pm in the eastern
      United States would start holding between 8 am and 4 pm at the end
      of October.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Authors of CPL servers should be careful to handle correctly the
   intervals when local time is discontinuous, at the beginning or end
   of daylight-savings time.  Note especially that some times may occur
   more than once when clocks are set back.  The algorithm in Appendix A
   is believed to handle this correctly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Time nodes specify a list of periods during which their output should
   be taken.  They have two required parameters: "dtstart", which
   specifies the beginning of the first period of the list, and exactly
   one of "dtend" or "duration", which specify the ending time or the
   duration of the period, respectively.  The "dtstart" and "dtend"
   parameters are formatted as iCalendar COS DATE-TIME values, as
   specified in Section 4.3.5 of RFC 2445 [8].  Because time zones are
   specified in the top-level "time-switch" tag, only forms 1 or 2
   (floating or UTC times) can be used.  The "duration" parameter is
   given as an iCalendar COS DURATION parameter, as specified in section
   4.3.6 of RFC 2445.  Both the DATE-TIME and the DURATION syntaxes are
   subsets of the corresponding syntaxes from ISO 8601 [20].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a recurring interval, the "duration" parameter MUST be small
   enough such that subsequent intervals do not overlap.  For non-
   recurring intervals, durations of any positive length are permitted.
   Zero-length and negative-length durations are not allowed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If no other parameters are specified, a time node indicates only a
   single period of time.  More complicated sets of period intervals are
   constructed as recurrences.  A recurrence is specified by including
   the "freq" parameter, which indicates the type of recurrence rule.
   Parameters other than "dtstart", "dtend", and "duration" SHOULD NOT
   be specified unless "freq" is present, though CPL servers SHOULD
   accept scripts with such parameters present, and ignore the other
   parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "freq" parameter takes one of the following values: "secondly",
   to specify repeating periods based on an interval of a second or
   more, "minutely", to specify repeating periods based on an interval
   of a minute or more, "hourly", to specify repeating periods based on
   an interval of an hour or more, "daily", to specify repeating periods
   based on an interval of a day or more, "weekly", to specify repeating
   periods based on an interval of a week or more, "monthly", to specify
   repeating periods based on an interval of a month or more, and
   "yearly", to specify repeating periods based on an interval of a year
   or more.  These values are not case-sensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "interval" parameter contains a positive integer representing how
   often the recurrence rule repeats.  The default value is "1", meaning
   every second for a "secondly" rule, every minute for a "minutely"
   rule, every hour for an "hourly" rule, every day for a "daily" rule,
   every week for a "weekly" rule, every month for a "monthly" rule, and
   every year for a "yearly" rule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "until" parameter defines an iCalendar COS DATE or DATE-TIME
   value which bounds the recurrence rule in an inclusive manner.  If
   the value specified by "until" is synchronized with the specified
   recurrence, this date or date-time becomes the last instance of the
   recurrence.  If specified as a date-time value, then it MUST be
   specified in UTC time format.  If not present, and the "count"
   parameter is not also present, the recurrence is considered to repeat
   forever.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "count" parameter defines the number of occurrences at which to
   range-bound the recurrence.  The "dtstart" parameter counts as the
   first occurrence.  The "until" and "count" parameters MUST NOT occur
   in the same "time" output.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "bysecond" parameter specifies a comma-separated list of seconds
   within a minute.  Valid values are 0 to 59.  The "byminute" parameter
   specifies a comma-separated list of minutes within an hour.  Valid

   first Monday within the month, whereas -1MO represents the last
   Monday of the month.  If an integer modifier is not present, it means
   all days of this type within the specified frequency.  For example,
   within a "monthly" rule, MO represents all Mondays within the month.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "bymonthday" parameter specifies a comma-separated list of days

   number one of the calendar year is the first week which contains at
   least four (4) days in that calendar year.  This parameter is only<br>
   valid for "yearly" rules.  For example, 3 represents the third week

   (This sub-sub-section is non-normative.)

   The specification of recurring events in this section is identical
   (except for syntax and formatting issues) to that of RFC 2445 [8],
   with only one additional restriction.  That one restriction is that
   consecutive instances of recurrence intervals may not overlap.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It was a matter of some debate, during the design of CPL, whether the
   entire iCalendar COS recurrence specification should be included in
   CPL, or whether only a subset should be included.  It was eventually
   decided that compatibility between the two protocols was of primary
   importance.  This imposes some additional implementation issues on
   implementors of CPL servers.
   It does not appear to be possible to determine, in constant time,
   whether a given instant of time falls within one of the intervals
   defined by a full iCalendar COS recurrence.  The primary concerns are
   as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  The "count" parameter cannot be checked in constant running
         time, since it requires that the server enumerate all
         recurrences from "dtstart" to the present time, in order to
         determine whether the current recurrence satisfies the
         parameter.  However, a server can expand a "count" parameter
         once, off-line, to determine the date of the last recurrence.
         This date can then be treated as a virtual "until" parameter
         for the server's internal processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Similarly, the "bysetpos" parameter requires that the server
         enumerate all instances of the occurrence from the start of the
         current recurrence set until the present time.  This requires
         somewhat more complex pre-processing, but generally, a single
         recurrence with a "bysetpos" parameter can be split up into
         several recurrences without them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Finally, constant running time of time switches also requires
         that a candidate starting time for a recurrence can be
         established quickly and uniquely, to check whether it satisfies
         the other restrictions.  This requires that a recurrence's
         duration not be longer than its repetition interval, so that a
         given instant cannot fall within several consecutive potential
         repetitions of the recurrence.  The restriction that
         consecutive intervals not overlap partially satisfies this
         condition, but does not fully ensure it.  Again, to some extent
         pre-processing can help resolve this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The algorithm given in Appendix A runs in constant time after these
   pre-processing steps.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers ought to check that recurrence rules do not create any absurd

   The abstract location model of CPL is described in Section 2.3.  The
   behavior of several of the signalling operations (defined in Section
   6) is dependent on the current location set specified.  Location
   nodes add or remove locations from the location set.
   There are three types of location nodes defined.  Explicit locations
   add literally-specified locations to the current location set,
   location lookups obtain locations from some outside source, and
   location filters remove locations from the set, based on some
   specified criteria.

   Figure 9: Syntax of the "location" node

   Explicit location nodes have three node parameters.  The mandatory

   location set.  Only one address may be specified per location node;
   multiple locations may be specified by cascading these nodes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The optional "priority" parameter specifies a priority for the

   Figure 10: Syntax of the "lookup" node

   Location lookup nodes have one mandatory parameter and two optional
   parameters.  The mandatory parameter is "source", the source of the
   lookup.  This can either be a URI, or a non-URI value.  If the value
   of "source" is a URI, it indicates a location which the CPL server
   can query to obtain an object with the text/uri-list media type (see
   the IANA registration of this type, which also appears in RFC 2483
   [10]).  The query is performed verbatim, with no additional
   information (such as URI parameters) added.  The server adds the
   locations contained in this object to the location set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CPL servers MAY refuse to allow URI-based sources for location
   queries for some or all URI schemes.  In this case, they SHOULD
   reject the script at script upload time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There has been discussion of having CPL servers add URI parameters
      to the location request, so that (for instance) CGI scripts could
      be used to resolve them.  However, the consensus was that this
      should be a CPL extension, not a part of the base specification.
   Non-URL sources indicate a source not specified by a URL which the
   server can query for addresses to add to the location set.  The only
   non-URL source currently defined is "registration", which specifies
   all the locations currently registered with the server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "lookup" node also has two optional parameters.  The "timeout"
   parameter specifies the time, as a positive integer number of
   seconds, the script is willing to wait for the lookup to be
   performed.  If this is not specified, its default value is 30.  The
   "clear" parameter specifies whether the location set should be
   cleared before the new locations are added.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Lookup has three outputs: "success", "notfound", and "failure".
   Notfound is taken if the lookup process succeeded but did not find
   any locations; failure is taken if the lookup failed for some reason,
   including that the specified timeout was exceeded.  If a given output
   is not present, script execution terminates and the default behavior
   is performed.

   Figure 12: Syntax of the "proxy" node

   After a proxy operation has completed, the CPL server chooses the
   "best" response to the call attempt, as defined by the signalling
   protocol or the server's administrative configuration rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the call attempt was successful, CPL execution terminates and the
   server proceeds to its default behavior (normally, to allow the call
   to be set up).  Otherwise, the next node corresponding to one of the
   "proxy" node's outputs is taken.  The "busy" output is followed if
   the call was busy, "noanswer" is followed if the call was not
   answered before the "timeout" parameter expired, "redirection" is
   followed if the call was redirected, and "failure" is followed if the
   call setup failed for any other reason.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If one of the conditions above is true, but the corresponding output
   was not specified, the "default" output of the "proxy" node is
   followed instead.  If there is also no "default" node specified, CPL
   execution terminates and the server returns to its default behavior
   (normally, to forward the best response upstream to the originator).
      Note: CPL extensions to allow in-call or end-of-call operations
      will require an additional output, such as "success", to be added.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If no locations were present in the set, or if the only locations in
   the set were locations to which the server cannot proxy a call (for
   example, "http" URLs), the "failure" output is taken.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Proxy has three optional parameters.  The "timeout" parameter
   specifies the time, as a positive integer number of seconds, to wait
   for the call to be completed or rejected; after this time has
   elapsed, the call attempt is terminated and the "noanswer" branch is
   taken.  If this parameter is not specified, the default value is 20
   seconds if the "proxy" node has a "noanswer" or "default" output
   specified; otherwise the server SHOULD allow the call to ring for a
   reasonably long period of time (to the maximum extent that server
   policy allows).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second optional parameter is "recurse", which can take two
   values, "yes" or "no".  This specifies whether the server should
   automatically attempt to place further call attempts to telephony
   addresses in redirection responses that were returned from the
   initial server.  Note that if the value of "recurse" is "yes", the
   "redirection" output to the script is never taken.  In this case this
   output SHOULD NOT be present.  The default value of this parameter is
   "yes".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The third optional parameter is "ordering".  This can have three
   possible values: "parallel", "sequential", and "first-only".  This
   parameter specifies in what order the locations of the location set
   should be tried.  Parallel asks that they all be tried
   simultaneously; sequential asks that the one with the highest
   priority be tried first, the one with the next-highest priority
   second, and so forth, until one succeeds or the set is exhausted.
   First-only instructs the server to try only the highest-priority
   address in the set, and then follow one of the outputs.  The priority
   of locations in a set is determined by server policy, though CPL
   servers SHOULD honor the "priority" parameter of the "location" tag.
   The default value of this parameter is "parallel".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once a proxy operation completes, if control is passed on to other
   nodes, all locations which have been used are cleared from the
   location set.  That is, the location set is emptied of proxyable
   locations if the "ordering" was "parallel" or "sequential"; the
   highest-priority item in the set is removed from the set if
   "ordering" was "first-only".  (In all cases, non-proxyable locations
   such as "http" URIs remain.)  In the case of a "redirection" output,
   the new addresses to which the call was redirected are then added to
   the location set.

   the following events:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      busy: A 486 or 600 response was the best response received for the
            call request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      redirection: A 3xx response was the best response received for the
            call request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      failure: Any other 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx response was the best response
            received for the call request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      no-answer: No final response was received for the call request
            before the timeout expired.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SIP servers SHOULD honor the "q" parameter of SIP registrations when
   determining location priority.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Redirect</h3></a>

   Redirect causes the server to direct the calling party to attempt to
   place its call to the currently specified set of locations.  The
   syntax of this node is specified in Figure 13.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The specific behavior the redirect node invokes is dependent on the

   Figure 13: Syntax of the "redirect" node

   Redirect immediately terminates execution of the CPL script, so this
   node has no outputs and no next node.  It has one parameter,
   "permanent", which specifies whether the result returned should
   indicate that this is a permanent redirection.  The value of this
   parameter is either "yes" or "no" and its default value is "no."
	<a name="section-6.2.1"><h4>6.2.1   Usage of "redirect" with SIP</h4></a>

   The SIP server SHOULD send a 3xx class response to a call request
   upon executing a "redirect" tag.  If "permanent" was "yes", the
   server SHOULD send the response "301" (Moved permanently), otherwise
   it SHOULD send "302" (Moved temporarily).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Reject</h3></a>

   Figure 15: Syntax of the "mail" node

   The "mail" node takes one argument: a "mailto" URL giving the
   address, and any additional desired parameters, of the mail to be
   sent.  The server sends the message containing the content to the
   given url; it SHOULD also include other status information about the
   original call request and the CPL script at the time of the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A mail node has only one possible result, since failure of e-mail

	<a name="section-7.1.1"><h4>7.1.1   Suggested Content of Mailed Information</h4></a>

   This section presents suggested guidelines for the mail sent as a

         header, it is used instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      2. The "From" field of the e-mail is set to a CPL server

         scheme).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      4. If the "mailto" URI specifies a body, it is used.  If none was

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   Log</h3></a>

   The Log node causes the server to log information about the call to
   non-volatile storage.  Its syntax is specified in Figure 16.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">               Node:  "log"
            Outputs:  None       (Next node follows directly)

         Parameters:  "name"     Name of the log file to use
                      "comment"  Comment to be placed in log file

   Figure 16: Syntax of the "log" node

   Log takes two arguments, both optional: "name", which specifies the
   name of the log, and "comment", which gives a comment about the
   information being logged.  Servers SHOULD also include other
   information in the log, such as the time of the logged event,
   information that triggered the call to be logged, and so forth.  Logs
   are specific to the owner of the script which logged the event.  If
   the "name" parameter is not given, the event is logged to a standard,
   server-defined log file for the script owner.  This specification
   does not define how users may retrieve their logs from the server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The name of a log is a logical name only, and does not necessarily
   correspond to any physical file on the server.  The interpretation of
   the log file name is server defined, as is a mechanism to access
   these logs.  The CPL server SHOULD NOT directly map log names
   uninterpreted onto local file names, for security reasons, lest a
   security-critical file be overwritten.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A correctly operating CPL server SHOULD NOT ever allow the "log"
   event to fail.  As such, log nodes can have only one possible result,
   and their XML representation does not have explicit output tags.  A
   CPL <log> tag directly contains another node tag.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Subactions</h2></a>

   XML syntax defines a tree.  To allow more general call flow diagrams,
   and to allow script re-use and modularity, we define subactions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two tags are defined for subactions: subaction definitions and
   subaction references.  Their syntax is given in Figure 17.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">               Tag:  "subaction"
           Subtags:  Any node

       Pseudo-node:  "sub"
           Outputs:  None in XML tree
        Parameters:  "ref"             Name of subaction to execute

   Figure 17: Syntax of subactions and "sub" pseudo-nodes

   Subactions are defined through "subaction" tags.  These tags are
   placed in the CPL script after any ancillary information (see Section
   9), but before any top-level tags.  They take one argument: "id", a
   token indicating a script-chosen name for the subaction.  The "id"
   value for every "subaction" tag in a script MUST be unique within
   that script.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subactions are called from "sub" tags.  The "sub" tag is a "pseudo-
   node", and can be used anyplace in a CPL action that a true node
   could be used.  It takes one parameter, "ref", the name of the
   subaction to be called.  The "sub" tag contains no outputs of its
   own, instead control passes to the subaction.
   References to subactions MUST refer to subactions defined before the
   current action.  A "sub" tag MUST NOT refer to the action it appears
   in, or to any action defined later in the CPL script.  Top-level
   actions cannot be called from "sub" tags, or through any other means.
   Script servers MUST verify at the time the script is submitted that
   no "sub" node refers to any subaction that is not its proper
   predecessor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Allowing only back-references of subs forbids any sort of
      recursion.  Recursion would introduce the possibility of non-
      terminating or non-decidable CPL scripts, a possibility our
      requirements specifically excluded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Every sub MUST refer to a subaction ID defined within the same CPL
   script.  No external links are permitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subaction IDs are case sensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If any subsequent version or extension defines external linkages,
      it should probably use a different tag, perhaps XLink [21].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Ancillary Information</h2></a>

   No ancillary information is defined in the base CPL specification.
   If ancillary information, not part of any operation, is found to be
   necessary for a CPL extension, it SHOULD be placed within this tag.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The (trivial) definition of the ancillary information tag is given in
   Figure 18.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      It may be useful to include timezone definitions inside CPL

   When a CPL node reaches an unspecified output, either because the
   output tag is not present, or because the tag is present but does not

           node, the call should be allowed to ring for the maximum

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   CPL Extensions</h2></a>

   Servers MAY support additional CPL features beyond those listed in
   this document.  Some of the extensions which have been suggested are
   a means of querying how a call has been authenticated, richer control
   over H.323 addressing, end-system or administrator-specific features,
   regular-expression matching for strings and addresses, and mid-call
   or end-of-call controls.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CPL extensions are indicated by XML namespaces [11].  Every extension
   MUST have an appropriate XML namespace assigned to it.  The XML
   namespace of the extension MUST be different from the XML namespace
   defined in Section 14.  The extension MUST NOT change the syntax or
   semantics of the CPL schema defined in this document.  All XML tags
   and attributes that are part of the extension MUST be appropriately
   qualified so as to place them within that namespace.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Tags or attributes in a CPL script which are in the global namespace
   (i.e., not associated with any namespace) are equivalent to tags and
   attributes in the CPL namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:cpl".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A CPL script SHOULD NOT specify any namespaces it does not use.  For
   compatibility with non-namespace-aware parsers, a CPL script MAY omit
   the base CPL namespace for a script which does not use any
   extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A CPL server MUST reject any script containing a reference to a

      was suggested as an alternate way of handling extensions.  This
      would allow scripts to be uploaded to a server without requiring a
      script author to somehow determine which extensions a server
      supports.  However, experience developing other languages, notably
      Sieve [22], was that this added excessive complexity to languages.
      The "extension-switch" tag could, of course, itself be defined in

A.  An Algorithm for Resolving Time Switches

   The following algorithm determines whether a given instant falls
   within a repetition of a "time-switch" recurrence.  If the pre-
   processing described in Section 4.4.1 has been done, it operates in
   constant time.  Open-source Java code implementing this algorithm is
   available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~lennox/Cal-Code/ on the
   world wide web.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This algorithm is believed to be correct, but this section is non-
   normative.  Section 4.4, and RFC 2445 [8], are the definitive
   definitions of recurrences.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1. Compute the time of the call, in the timezone of the time
         switch.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      2. If the call time is earlier than "dtstart", fail NOMATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      3. If the call time is less than "duration" after dtstart, succeed
         MATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      4. Determine the smallest unit specified in a "byxxx" rule or by
         the "freq."  Call this the Minimum Unit.  Determine the
         previous instant (before or equal to the call time) when all
         the time units smaller than the minimum unit are the same as
         those of "dtstart."  If the minimum unit is a second, this time
         is the same as the instant.  If the minimum unit is a minute or
         an hour, the minutes or the minutes and hours, respectively,
         must be the same as "dtstart".  For all other minimum units,
         the time-of-day must be the same as "dtstart."  If the minimum
         unit is a week, the day-of-the-week must be the same as
         "dtstart."  If the minimum unit is a month, the day-of-the-
         month must be the same as "dtstart."  If the minimum unit is a
         year, the month and day-of-month must both be the same as
         "dtstart."  (Note that this means it may be necessary to roll
         back more than one minimum unit -- if the minimum unit is a
         month, then some months do not have a 31st (or 30th or 29th)
         day; if the minimum unit is a year, then some years do not have
         a February 29th.  In the Gregorian calendar, it is never
         necessary to roll back more than two months if the minimum unit
         is a month, or eight years if the minimum unit is a year.
         Between 1904 and 2096, it is never necessary to roll back more
         than four years -- the eight-year rollback can only occur when
         the Gregorian calendar "skips" a leap year.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Call this instant the Candidate Start Time.

         is more than the duration, fail NOMATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      6. If the candidate start time is later than the "until" parameter
         of the recurrence (or the virtual "until" computed off-line
         from "count"), fail NOMATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      7. Call the unit of the "freq" parameter of the recurrence the
         Frequency Unit.  Determine the frequency unit enclosing the
         Candidate Start Time, and that enclosing "dtstart".  Calculate
         the number of frequency units that have passed between these
         two times.  If this is not a multiple of the "interval"
         parameter, fail NOMATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      8. For every "byxxx" rule, confirm that the candidate start time
         matches one of the options specified by that "byxxx" rule.  If
         so, succeed MATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      9. Calculate a previous candidate start time.  Repeat until the
         difference between the candidate start time and the call time

         validated, fail NOMATCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.  Suggested Usage of CPL with H.323

   This appendix gives a suggested usage of CPL with H.323 [16].   Study
   Group 16 of the ITU, which developed H.323, is proposing to work on
   official CPL mappings for that protocol.  This section is therefore
   not normative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.1.  Usage of "address-switch" with H.323

   Address switches are specified in Section 4.1.  This section
   specifies the mapping between H.323 messages and the fields and
   subfields of address-switches.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For H.323, the "origin" address corresponds to the alias addresses in
   the "sourceAddress" field of the "Setup-UUIE" user-user information
   element, and to the Q.931 [23] information element "Calling party
   number."  If both fields are present, or if multiple alias addresses
   for "sourceAddress" are present, which one has priority is a matter
   of local server policy; the server SHOULD use the same resolution as
   it would use for routing decisions in this case.  Similarly, the
   "destination" address corresponds to the alias addresses of the
   "destinationAddress" field, and to the Q.931 information element
   "Called party number."
   The "original-destination" address corresponds to the "Redirecting
   number" Q.931 information element, if it is present; otherwise it is
   the same as the "destination" address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mapping of H.323 addresses into subfields depends on the type of
   the alias address.  An additional subfield type, "alias-type", is
   defined for H.323 servers, corresponding to the type of the address.
   Possible values are "dialedDigits", "h323-ID", "url-ID",
   "transportID", "email-ID", "partyNumber", "mobileUIM", and "Q.931IE".
   If future versions of the H.323 specification define additional types
   of alias addresses, those names MAY also be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In versions of H.323 prior to version 4, "dialedDigits" was known as
   "e164".  The two names SHOULD be treated as synonyms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The value of the "address-type" subfield for H.323 messages is "h323"
   unless the alias type is "url-ID" and the URL scheme is something
   other than h323; in this case the address-type is the URL scheme, as
   specified in Section 4.1.1 for SIP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An H.323-aware CPL server SHOULD map the address subfields from the
   primary alias used for routing.  It MAY also map subfields from other
   aliases, if subfields in the primary address are not present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following mappings are used for H.323 alias types:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      dialedDigits, partyNumber, mobileUIM, and Q.931IE: the "tel" and
           "user" subfields are the string of digits, as is the
           "entire-address" form.  The "host" and "port" subfields are
           not present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      url-ID: the same mappings are used as for SIP, in Section 4.1.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      h323-ID: the "user" field is the string of characters, as is the
           "entire-address" form.  All other subfields are not present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   H.323 [16] defines an "h323" URI scheme.  This appendix defines a
   mapping for these URIs onto the CPL "address-switch" subfields, as
   given in Section 4.1.  This definition is also available as RFC 3508
   [24], which is an excerpt from the H.323 specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For h323 URIs, the "user", "host", and "port" subfields are set to
   the corresponding parts of the H.323 URL.  The "tel" subfield is not
   present.  The "entire-address" form corresponds to the entire URI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This mapping MAY be used both for h323 URIs in an h323 "url-ID"
   address alias, and for h323 URIs in SIP messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.2.  Usage of "string-switch" with H.323

   For H.323, the "string-switch" node (see Section 4.2) is used as
   follows.  The field "display" corresponds to the Q.931 information
   element of the same name, copied verbatim.  The fields "subject",
   "organization", and "user-agent" are not used and are never present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The "display" IE is conventionally used for Caller-ID purposes, so
      arguably it should be mapped to the "display" subfield of an
      "address-match" with the field "originator".  However, since a) it
      is a message-level information element, not an address-level one,
      and b) the Q.931 specification [23] says only that "[t]he purpose
      of the Display information element is to supply display
      information that may be displayed by the user," it seems to be
      more appropriate to allow it to be matched in a "string-switch"
      instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.3.  Usage of "language-switch" with H.323

   The language-ranges for the "language-switch" switch are obtained
   from the H.323 UUIE "language".  The switch is not-present if the
   initial message did not contain this UUIE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.4.  Usage of "priority-switch" with H.323

   All H.323 messages are considered to have priority "normal" for the
   purpose of a priority switch (see Section 4.5).
B.5.  Usage of "location" with H.323

   Locations in explicit location nodes (Section 5.1) are specified as
   URLs.  Therefore, all locations added in this manner are interpreted
   as being of alias type "url-ID" in H.323.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Specifications of other H.323 address alias types will require a CPL
   extension (see Section 11).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.6.  Usage of "lookup" with H.323

   For location lookup nodes (Section 5.2), the "registration" lookup
   source corresponds to the locations registered with the server using
   "RAS" messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">B.7.  Usage of "remove-location" with H.323

   Location removal nodes (Section 5.3) remove addresses with the alias
   type "url-ID" using verbatim string matching on the URLs.  If a "tel"
   URL is specified as the location, matching addresses (ignoring visual
   separators) with the alias types "dialedDigits" ("e164"),
   "partyNumber", "mobileUIM", or "Q.931IE" are also removed.  No
   mechanism is provided to remove other alias types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">C.  The XML Schema for CPL

   This section includes a full XML Schema describing the XML syntax of
   CPL.   Every script submitted to a CPL server SHOULD comply with this
   XML Schema.   When parsing scripts comply with the CPL DTD in earlier
   documents, the DOCTYPE lines in the scripts should be ignored.  Note
   that compliance with this schema is not a sufficient condition for
   correctness of a CPL script, as many of the conditions described in
   this specification are not expressible in schema syntax.  Figure 31
   shows the structure of the schema.  'incoming' and 'outgoing' are
   defined as the substitutionGroup of the 'toplevelaction'.  All the
   switches are defined as the substitutionGroup of the 'switch'
   element.  All the actions are defined as the substitutionGroup of the
   'action' element.<pre>
