   The document specifies the following FEC Schemes according to the
   specification requirements of the FEC building block [RFC5052]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Compact No-Code FEC Scheme

   o  Small Block, Large Block, and Expandable FEC Scheme

   o  Small Block Systematic FEC Scheme

   o  Compact FEC Scheme

   This document inherits the context, language, declarations and
   restrictions of the FEC building block [RFC5052].  This document also
   uses the terminology of the companion document [RFC3453], which
   describes the use of FEC codes within the context of reliable IP
   multicast transport and provides an introduction to some commonly
   used FEC codes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Building blocks are defined in [RFC3048].  This document follows the
   general guidelines provided in [RFC3269].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC3452] and [RFC3695] contain previous versions of the FEC Schemes
   defined in this specification.  These RFCs were published in the
   "Experimental" category.  It was the stated intent of the RMT working
   group to re-submit these specifications as an IETF Proposed Standard
   in due course.  This document obsoletes [RFC3695].  [RFC3452] has
   already been obsoleted by [RFC5052], and this document assumes
   responsibility for aspects of [RFC3452] that were not included in
   [RFC5052].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This Proposed Standard specification is thus based on and backwards
   compatible with the FEC Schemes defined in [RFC3452] and [RFC3695],
   updated according to accumulated experience and growing protocol
   maturity since their original publication.  Said experience applies
   both to this specification itself and to congestion control
   strategies related to the use of this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The differences between the FEC Scheme specifications in [RFC3452]
   and [RFC3695] and this document are listed in Section 10.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Integer fields specified in this document are all encoded in network
   byte order.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Compact No-Code FEC Scheme</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Introduction</h3></a>

   The Compact No-code FEC Scheme is a Fully-Specified FEC Scheme.  The
   scheme requires no FEC coding and is specified primarily to allow
   simple interoperability testing between different implementations of
   protocol instantiations that use the FEC building block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Formats and Codes</h3></a>

	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   FEC Payload ID(s)</h4></a>

   The FEC Payload ID for the Compact No-Code FEC Scheme is composed of
   a Source Block Number and an Encoding Symbol ID as shown in Figure 1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        0                   1                   2                   3

      Figure 1: FEC Payload ID Format for Compact No-Code FEC Scheme

   The Source Block Number (SBN) is a 16-bit unsigned integer that is
   used to identify from which source block of the object the encoding
   symbol in the payload of the packet is generated.  There are two
   possible modes: in the unique SBN mode, each source block within the
   object has a unique Source Block Number associated with it, and in
   the non-unique SBN mode, the same Source Block Number may be used for
   more than one source block within the object.  Which mode is being
   used for an object is outside the scope of this document and MUST be
   communicated, either explicitly or implicitly, out-of-band to
   receivers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the unique SBN mode is used, then successive Source Block Numbers
   are associated with consecutive source blocks of the object starting
   with Source Block Number 0 for the first source block of the object.
   In this case, there are at most 2^^16 source blocks in the object.
   If the non-unique SBN mode is used, then the mapping from source
   blocks to Source Block Numbers MUST be communicated out-of-band to
   receivers, and how this is done is outside the scope of this
   document.  This mapping could be implicit, for example, determined by
   the transmission order of the source blocks.  In non-unique SBN mode,
   packets for two different source blocks mapped to the same Source
   Block Number SHOULD NOT be sent within an interval of time that is
   shorter than the transport time of a source block.  The transport
   time of a source block includes the amount of time needed to process
   the source block at the sender transport layer, the network transit
   time for packets, and the amount of time needed to process the source
   block at the receiver transport.  This allows the receiver to clearly
   decide which packets belong to which source block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Encoding Symbol ID is a 16-bit unsigned integer that identifies
   which specific encoding symbol generated from the source block is
   carried in the packet payload.  The exact details of the
   correspondence between Encoding Symbol IDs and the encoding symbols
   in the packet payload are specified in Section 3.4.

                      for Compact No-Code FEC Scheme

   The Transfer Length, Encoding Symbol Length, and Maximum Source Block
   Length are encoded as unsigned integers, of length 48 bits, 16 bits,
   and 32 bits, respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All Encoding Symbols of a transport object MUST have length equal to
   the length specified in the Encoding Symbol Length element, with the
   optional exception of the last source symbol of the last source block
   (so that redundant padding is not mandatory in this last symbol).
   This last source symbol MUST be logically padded out with zeroes when
   another Encoding Symbol is computed based on this source symbol to
   ensure the same interpretation of this Encoding Symbol value by the
   sender and receiver.  However, this padding does not actually need to
   be sent with the data of the last source symbol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "Reserved" field in the Encoded FEC Object Transmission
   Information MUST be set to zero by senders and its value MUST be
   ignored by receivers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note: this FEC Scheme was first defined in [RFC3695], which did
      not require that the Encoding Symbol Length should be the same for
      every source block.  This document introduces a general
      requirement that the Encoding Symbol Length be the same across
      source blocks.  Since no protocols were defined that support
      variation in the Encoding Symbol Length between source blocks,
      this can be done without introducing backwards compatibility
      issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.2.2.3"><h4>3.2.2.3   Scheme-Specific</h4></a>
                    

   No Scheme-Specific FEC Object Transmission Information elements are
   defined by this FEC Scheme.
	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Procedures</h3></a>

   The algorithm defined in Section 9.1. of [RFC5052] MUST be used to
   partition the file into source blocks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   FEC Code Specification</h3></a>

   The Compact No-Code FEC Scheme does not require FEC encoding or
   decoding.  Instead, each encoding symbol consists of consecutive
   bytes of a source block of the object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following two subsections describe the details of how the Compact
   No-Code FEC Scheme operates for each source block of an object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4.1"><h4>3.4.1   Source Block Logistics</h4></a>

   Let X > 0 be the length of a source block in bytes.  Let L > 0 be the
   length of the encoding symbol contained in the payload of each
   packet.  The value of X and L are part of the FEC Object Transmission
   Information, and how this information is communicated to a receiver
   is outside the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a given source block X bytes in length with Source Block Number
   I, let N = X/L rounded up to the nearest integer.  The encoding
   symbol carried in the payload of a packet consists of a consecutive
   portion of the source block.  The source block is logically
   partitioned into N encoding symbols, each L bytes in length, and the
   corresponding Encoding Symbol IDs range from 0 through N-1 starting
   at the beginning of the source block and proceeding to the end.
   Thus, the encoding symbol with Encoding Symbol ID Y consists of bytes
   L*Y through L*(Y+1)-1 of the source block, where the bytes of the
   source block are numbered from 0 through X-1.  If X/L is not integral
   then the last encoding symbol with Encoding Symbol ID = N-1 consists
   of bytes L*(N-1) through the last byte X-1 of the source block, and
   the remaining L*N - X bytes of the encoding symbol can by padded out
   with zeroes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As an example, suppose that the source block length X = 20,400 and
   encoding symbol length L = 1,000.  The encoding symbol with Encoding
   Symbol ID = 10 contains bytes 10,000 through 10,999 of the source
   block, and the encoding symbol with Encoding Symbol ID = 20 contains
   bytes 20,000 through the last byte 20,399 of the source block and the
   remaining 600 bytes of the encoding symbol can be padded with zeroes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are no restrictions beyond the rules stated above on how a
   sender generates encoding symbols to send from a source block.
   However, it is recommended that an implementor refer to the companion
   document [RFC3452] for general advice.
   In the next subsection, a procedure is recommended for sending and
   receiving source blocks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4.2"><h4>3.4.2   Sending and Receiving a Source Block</h4></a>

   The following carousel procedure is RECOMMENDED for a sender to
   generate packets containing FEC Payload IDs and corresponding
   encoding symbols for a source block with Source Block Number I.  Set
   the length in bytes of an encoding symbol to a fixed value L, which
   is reasonable for a packet payload (e.g., ensure that the total
   packet size does not exceed the MTU) and that is smaller than the
   source block length X, e.g., L = 1,000 for X >= 1,000.  Initialize Y
   to a value randomly chosen in the interval [0..N-1].  Repeat the
   following for each packet of the source block to be sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If Y <= N-1, then generate the encoding symbol Y.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Within the FEC Payload ID, set the Source Block Length to X, set
      the Source Block Number = I, set the Encoding Symbol ID = Y, place
      the FEC Payload ID and the encoding symbol into the packet to
      send.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  In preparation for the generation of the next packet: if Y < N-1
      then increment Y by one else if Y = N-1 then reset Y to zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following procedure is RECOMMENDED for a receiver to recover the
   source block based on receiving packets for the source block from a
   sender that is using the carousel procedure described above.  The
   receiver can determine from which source block a received packet was
   generated by the Source Block Number carried in the FEC Payload ID.
   Upon receipt of the first FEC Payload ID for a source block, the
   receiver uses the Source Block Length and Encoding Symbol Length
   received out-of-band as part of the FEC Object Transmission
   Information to determine the length X in bytes of the source block
   and length L in bytes of each encoding symbol.  The receiver
   allocates space for the X bytes that the source block requires.  The
   receiver also computes the length of the encoding symbol in the
   payload of the packet by subtracting the packet header length from
   the total length of the received packet.  The receiver checks that
   this symbol length is equal to L, except in the case that this is the
   last symbol of the source block in which case the symbol length in
   the packet may be less than L.  After calculating N = X/L rounded up
   to the nearest integer, the receiver allocates a boolean array
   RECEIVED[0..N-1] with all N entries initialized to false to track
   received encoding symbols.  The receiver keeps receiving packets for
   the source block as long as there is at least one entry in RECEIVED
   still set to false or until the application decides to give up on
   this source block and move on to other source blocks.  For each
   received packet for the source block (including the first packet),
   the steps to be taken to help recover the source block are as
   follows.  Let Y be the value of the Encoding Symbol ID within the FEC
   Payload ID of the packet.  If Y <= N-1, then the receiver copies the
   encoding symbol into the appropriate place within the space reserved
   for the source block and sets RECEIVED[Y] = true.  If all N entries
   of RECEIVED are true, then the receiver has recovered the entire
   source block.
