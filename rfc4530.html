   This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryUUID' operational
   attribute and associated matching rules and syntax.  The attribute
   holds a server-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the
   object.  Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish
   objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object
   after renaming.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Background and Intended Use</h2></a>

   In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510], an object
   is identified by its distinguished name (DN).  However, DNs are not
   stable identifiers.  That is, a new object may be identified by a DN
   that previously identified another (now renamed or deleted) object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is "an identifier unique
   across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs"
   [RFC4122].  UUIDs are used in a wide range of systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes the 'entryUUID' operational attribute, which
   holds the UUID assigned to the object by the server.  Clients may use
   this attribute to distinguish objects identified by a particular
   distinguished name or to locate a particular object after renaming.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines the UUID syntax, the 'uuidMatch' and
   'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rules, and the 'entryUUID' attribute
   type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
   [RFC4512].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped)
   for readability.
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
   [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   UUID Schema Elements</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   UUID Syntax</h3></a>

   A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [RFC4122] is a 16-octet (128-
   bit) value that identifies an object.  The ASN.1 [X.680] type UUID is
   defined to represent UUIDs as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       UUID ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(16))<br>
             -- constrained to an UUID [RFC4122]

   In LDAP, UUID values are encoded using the [ASCII] character string
   representation described in [RFC4122].  For example,
   "597ae2f6-16a6-1027-98f4-d28b5365dc14".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following is an LDAP syntax description suitable for publication
   in subschema subentries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 1.3.6.1.1.16.1 DESC 'UUID' )

	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   'uuidMatch' Matching Rule</h3></a>

   The 'uuidMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with a stored
   UUID for equality.  Its semantics are the same as the
   'octetStringMatch' [X.520][RFC4517] matching rule.  The rule differs
   from 'octetStringMatch' in that the assertion value is encoded using
   the UUID string representation instead of the normal OCTET STRING
   string representation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following is an LDAP matching rule description suitable for
   publication in subschema subentries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 1.3.6.1.1.16.2 NAME 'uuidMatch'
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.1.16.1 )

	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   'uuidOrderingMatch' Matching Rule</h3></a>

   The 'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with
   a stored UUID for ordering.  Its semantics are the same as the
   'octetStringOrderingMatch' [X.520][RFC4517] matching rule.  The rule
   differs from 'octetStringOrderingMatch' in that the assertion value
   is encoded using the UUID string representation instead of the normal
   OCTET STRING string representation.
   The following is an LDAP matching rule description suitable for
   publication in subschema subentries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 1.3.6.1.1.16.3 NAME 'uuidOrderingMatch'
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.1.16.1 )

   Note that not all UUID variants have a defined ordering; and even
   where it does, servers are not obligated to assign UUIDs in any
   particular order.  This matching rule is provided for completeness.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   'entryUUID' Attribute</h3></a>

   The 'entryUUID' operational attribute provides the Universally Unique
   Identifier (UUID) assigned to the entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following is an LDAP attribute type description suitable for
   publication in subschema subentries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 1.3.6.1.1.16.4 NAME 'entryUUID'
           DESC 'UUID of the entry'
           EQUALITY uuidMatch
           ORDERING uuidOrderingMatch
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.1.16.1
           SINGLE-VALUE
           NO-USER-MODIFICATION
           USAGE directoryOperation )

   Servers SHALL generate and assign a new UUID to each entry upon its
   addition to the directory and provide that UUID as the value of the
   'entryUUID' operational attribute.  An entry's UUID is immutable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   UUID are to be generated in accordance with Section 4 of [RFC4122].
   In particular, servers MUST ensure that each generated UUID is unique
   in space and time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   An entry's relative distinguish name (RDN) is composed from attribute
   values of the entry, which are commonly descriptive of the object the
   entry represents.  Although deployers are encouraged to use naming
   attributes whose values are widely disclosable [RFC4514], entries are
   often named using information that cannot be disclosed to all
   parties.  As UUIDs do not contain any descriptive information of the
   object they identify, UUIDs may be used to identify a particular
   entry without disclosure of its contents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   General UUID security considerations [RFC4122] apply.
   General LDAP security considerations [RFC4510] apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   The IANA has registered the LDAP values [RFC4520] specified in this
   document.
