	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Terminology</h2></a>

   The following terms have a precise meaning when used in this
   document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   system        a device that implements the Internet Protocol, IP [9].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   router        a system that forwards IP datagrams, as specified
                 in [2].  This does not include systems that, though
                 capable of IP forwarding, have that capability turned
                 off.  Nor does it include systems that do IP forwarding
                 only insofar as required to obey IP Source Route
                 options.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   host          any system that is not a router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   multicast     unless otherwise qualified, means the use of either IP
                 multicast [4] or IP broadcast [6] service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   link          a communication facility or medium over which systems
                 can communicate at the link layer, i.e., the protocol
                 layer immediately below IP.  The term "physical
                 network" has sometimes been used (imprecisely) for
                 this. Examples of links are LANs (possibly bridged to
                 other LANs), wide-area store-and-forward networks,
                 satellite channels, and point-to-point links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   multicast link
                 a link over which IP multicast or IP broadcast service
                 is supported.  This includes broadcast media such as
                 LANs and satellite channels, single point-to-point
                 links, and some store-and-forward networks such as SMDS
                 networks [8].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   interface     a system's attachment point to a link.  It is possible
                 (though unusual) for a system to have more than one
                 interface to the same link.  Interfaces are uniquely
                 identified by IP unicast addresses; a single interface
                 may have more than one such address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   multicast interface
                 an interface to a multicast link, that is, an interface
                 to a link over which IP multicast or IP broadcast
                 service is supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   subnet        either a single subnet of a subnetted IP network [7] or
                 a single non-subnetted IP network, i.e., the entity
                 identified by an IP address logically ANDed with its
                 assigned subnet mask.  More than one subnet may exist
                 on the same link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   neighboring   having an IP address belonging to the same subnet.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Protocol Overview</h2></a>

   Before a host can send IP datagrams beyond its directly-attached
   subnet, it must discover the address of at least one operational
   router on that subnet. Typically, this is accomplished by reading a
   list of one or more router addresses from a (possibly remote)
   configuration file at startup time.  On multicast links, some hosts
   also discover router addresses by listening to routing protocol
   traffic.  Both of these methods have serious drawbacks: configuration
   files must be maintained manually -- a significant administrative
   burden -- and are unable to track dynamic changes in router
   availability; eavesdropping on routing traffic requires that hosts
   recognize the particular routing protocols in use, which vary from
   subnet to subnet and which are subject to change at any time.  This
   document specifies an alternative router discovery method using a
   pair of ICMP [10] messages, for use on multicast links.  It
   eliminates the need for manual configuration of router addresses and
   is independent of any specific routing protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ICMP router discovery messages are called "Router Advertisements"
   and "Router Solicitations".  Each router periodically multicasts a
   Router Advertisement from each of its multicast interfaces,
   announcing the IP address(es) of that interface.  Hosts discover the
   addresses of their neighboring routers simply by listening for
   advertisements.  When a host attached to a multicast link starts up,
   it may multicast a Router Solicitation to ask for immediate
   advertisements, rather than waiting for the next periodic ones to
   arrive; if (and only if) no advertisements are forthcoming, the host
   may retransmit the solicitation a small number of times, but then
   must desist from sending any more solicitations.  Any routers that
   subsequently start up, or that were not discovered because of packet
   loss or temporary link partitioning, are eventually discovered by
   reception of their periodic (unsolicited) advertisements.  (Links
   that suffer high packet loss rates or frequent partitioning are
   accommodated by increasing the rate of advertisements, rather than
   increasing the number of solicitations that hosts are permitted to
   send.)

   The router discovery messages do not constitute a routing protocol:
   they enable hosts to discover the existence of neighboring routers,
   but not which router is best to reach a particular destination.  If a
   host chooses a poor first-hop router for a particular destination, it
   should receive an ICMP Redirect from that router, identifying a
   better one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Router Advertisement includes a "preference level" for each
   advertised router address.  When a host must choose a default router
   address (i.e., when, for a particular destination, the host has not
   been redirected or configured to use a specific router address), it
   is expected to choose from those router addresses that have the
   highest preference level (see Section 3.3.1 in the Host Requirements
   -- Communication Layers RFC [1]).  A network administrator can
   configure router address preference levels to encourage or discourage
   the use of particular routers as default routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Router Advertisement also includes a "lifetime" field, specifying
   the maximum length of time that the advertised addresses are to be
   considered as valid router addresses by hosts, in the absence of
   further advertisements.  This is used to ensure that hosts eventually
   forget about routers that fail, become unreachable, or stop acting as
   routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The default advertising rate is once every 7 to 10 minutes, and the
   default lifetime is 30 minutes.  This means that, using the default
   values, the advertisements are not sufficient as a mechanism for
   "black hole" detection, i.e., detection of failure of the first hop
   of an active path -- ideally, black holes should be detected quickly
   enough to switch to another router before any transport connections
   or higher-layer sessions time out.  It is assumed that hosts already
   have mechanisms for black hole detection, as required by [1].  Hosts
   cannot depend on Router Advertisements for this purpose, since they
   may be unavailable or administratively disabled on any particular
   link or from any particular router.  Therefore, the default
   advertising rate and lifetime values were chosen simply to make the
   load imposed on links and hosts by the periodic multicast
   advertisements negligible, even when there are many routers present.
   However, a network administrator who wishes to employ advertisements
   as a supplemental black hole detection mechanism is free to configure
   smaller values.

   A router that implements the ICMP router discovery messages must
   allow for the following variables to be configured by system
   management; default values are specified so as to make it unnecessary
   to configure any of these variables in many cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For each multicast interface:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AdvertisementAddress
                 The IP destination address to be used for multicast
                 Router Advertisements sent from the interface.  The
                 only permissible values are the all-systems multicast
                 address, 224.0.0.1, or the limited-broadcast address,
                 255.255.255.255.  (The all-systems address is preferred
                 wherever possible, i.e., on any link where all
                 listening hosts support IP multicast.)

                 Default: 224.0.0.1 if the router supports IP multicast
                 on the interface, else 255.255.255.255

   MaxAdvertisementInterval
                 The maximum time allowed between sending multicast
                 Router Advertisements from the interface, in seconds.
                 Must be no less than 4 seconds and no greater than 1800
                 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: 600 seconds

                 multicast Router Advertisements from the interface, in
                 seconds.  Must be no less than 3 seconds and no greater

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: 0.75 * MaxAdvertisementInterval
   AdvertisementLifetime
                 The value to be placed in the Lifetime field of Router
                 Advertisements sent from the interface, in seconds.
                 Must be no less than MaxAdvertisementInterval and no
                 greater than 9000 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: 3 * MaxAdvertisementInterval

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Advertise
                 A flag indicating whether or not the address is to be
                 advertised.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: TRUE

   PreferenceLevel
                 The preferability of the address as a default router
                 address, relative to other router addresses on the same
                 subnet.  A 32-bit, signed, twos-complement integer,
                 with higher values meaning more preferable.  The
                 minimum value (hex 80000000) is used to indicate that
                 the address, even though it may be advertised, is not
                 to be used by neighboring hosts as a default router
                 address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: 0

   The case in which it is useful to configure an address with a
   preference level of hex 80000000 (rather than simply setting its
   Advertise flag to FALSE) is when advertisements are being used for
   "black hole" detection, as mentioned in Section 2.  In particular, a
   router that is to be used to reach only specific IP destinations
   could advertise its address with a preference level of hex 80000000
   (so that neighboring hosts will not use it as a default router for
   reaching arbitrary IP destinations) and a non-zero lifetime (so that
   neighboring hosts that have been redirected or configured to use it
   can detect its failure by timing out the reception of its
   advertisements).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It has been suggested that, when the preference level of an address
   has not been explicitly configured, a router could set it according
   to the metric of the router's "default route" (if it has one), rather
   than defaulting it to zero as suggested above.  Thus, a router with a
   better metric for its default route would advertise a higher
   preference level for its address.  (Note that routing metrics that
   are encoded such that "lower is better" would have to be inverted
   before being used as preference levels in Router Advertisement
   messages.)  Such a strategy might reduce the amount of ICMP Redirect
   traffic on some links by making it more likely that a host's first
   choice router for reaching an arbitrary destination is also the best
   choice.  On the other hand, Redirect traffic is rarely a significant
   load on a link, and there are some cases where such a strategy would
   result in more Redirect traffic, not less (for example, on links from
   which the most frequently chosen destinations are best reached via
   routers other than the one with the best default route).  This
   document makes no recommendation concerning this issue, and

   first 8, are ignored.  Future, backward-compatible changes to the
   protocol may specify the contents of the Reserved field or of
   additional octets at the end of the message; backward-incompatible
   changes may use different Code values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A solicitation that passes the validity checks is called a "valid
   solicitation".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A router may silently discard any received Router Advertisement
   messages.  Any other action on reception of such messages by a router
   (for example, as part of a "peer discovery" process) is beyond the
   scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3  Router Behavior</h3></a>

   The router joins the all-routers IP multicast group (224.0.0.2) on
   all interfaces on which the router supports IP multicast.
   The term "advertising interface" refers to any functioning and
   enabled multicast interface that has at least one IP address whose
   configured Advertise flag is TRUE.  From each advertising interface,
   the router transmits periodic, multicast Router Advertisements,
   containing the following values:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - In the destination address field of the IP header: the
        interface's configured AdvertisementAddress.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - In the Lifetime field: the interface's configured
        AdvertisementLifetime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - In the Router Address[i] and Preference Level[i] fields:
        all of the interface's addresses whose Advertise flags are
        TRUE, along with their corresponding PreferenceLevel
        values.  (In the unlikely event that not all addresses fit
        in a single advertisement, as constrained by the MTU of the
        link, multiple advertisements are sent, with each except
        the last containing as many addresses as can fit.)

   The advertisements are not strictly periodic: the interval between
   subsequent transmissions is randomized to reduce the probability of
   synchronization with the advertisements from other routers on the
   same link. This is done by maintaining a separate transmission
   interval timer for each advertising interface.  Each time a multicast
   advertisement is sent from an interface, that interface's timer is
   reset to a uniformly-distributed random value between the interface's
   configured MinAdvertisementInterval and MaxAdvertisementInterval;
   expiration of the timer causes the next advertisement to be sent from
   the interface, and a new random value to be chosen.  (It is
   recommended that routers include some unique value, such as one of
   their IP or link-layer addresses, in the seed used to initialize
   their pseudo-random number generators.  Although the randomization
   range is configured in units of seconds, the actual randomly-chosen
   values should not be in units of whole seconds, but rather in units
   of the highest available timer resolution.)

   For the first few advertisements sent from an interface (up to
   MAX_INITIAL_ADVERTISEMENTS), if the randomly chosen interval is
   greater than MAX_INITIAL_ADVERT_INTERVAL, the timer should be set to
   MAX_INITIAL_ADVERT_INTERVAL instead.  Using this smaller interval for
   the initial advertisements increases the likelihood of a router being
   discovered quickly when it first becomes available, in the presence
   of possible packet loss.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to the periodic, unsolicited advertisements, a router
   sends advertisements in response to valid solicitations received on
   any of its advertising interfaces.  A router may choose to unicast
   the response directly to the soliciting host's address (if it is not
   zero), or multicast it to the interface's configured
   AdvertisementAddress; in the latter case, the interface's interval
   timer is reset to a new random value, as with unsolicited
   advertisements.  A unicast response may be delayed, and a multicast
   response must be delayed, for a small random interval not greater
   than MAX_RESPONSE_DELAY, in order to prevent synchronization with
   other responding routers, and to allow multiple, closely-spaced
   solicitations to be answered with a single multicast advertisement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a router receives a solicitation sent to an IP broadcast address,
   on an interface whose configured AdvertisementAddress is an IP
   multicast address, the router may send its response to the IP
   broadcast address instead of the configured IP multicast address.
   Such an event indicates a configuration inconsistency, and should be
   logged for possible corrective action by the network administrator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that an interface may become an advertising
   interface at times other than system startup, as a result of recovery
   from an interface failure or through actions of system management
   such as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - enabling the interface, if it had been administratively
        disabled and it has one or more addresses whose Advertise
        flag is TRUE, or

      - enabling IP forwarding capability (i.e., changing the
        system from being a host to being a router), when the
        interface has one or more addresses whose Advertise flag is
        TRUE, or

      - setting the Advertise flag of one or more of the
        interface's addresses to TRUE (or adding a new address with
        a TRUE Advertise flag), when previously the interface had
        no address whose Advertise flag was TRUE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">In such cases, the router must commence transmission of periodic
advertisements on the new advertising interface, limiting the first few
advertisements to intervals no greater than MAX_INITIAL_ADVERT_INTERVAL.
In the case of a host becoming a router, the system must also join the
all-routers IP multicast group on all interfaces on which the router
supports IP multicast (whether or not they are advertising interfaces).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">An interface may also cease to be an advertising interface, through
actions of system management such as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - administratively disabling the interface,
      - shutting down the system, or disabling the IP forwarding
        capability (i.e., changing the system from being a router
        to being a host), or

      - setting the Advertise flags of all of the interface's
        addresses to FALSE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In such cases, it is recommended (but not required) that the router
   transmit a final multicast advertisement on the interface, identical
   to its previous transmission but with a Lifetime field of zero.  In
   the case of a router becoming a host, the system must also depart
   from the all-routers IP multicast group on all interfaces on which
   the router supports IP multicast (whether or not they had been
   advertising interfaces).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the Advertise flag of one or more of an interface's addresses
   are set to FALSE by system management, but there remain other
   addresses on that interface whose Advertise flags are TRUE, it is
   recommended that the router send a single multicast advertisement
   containing only those address whose Advertise flags were set to
   FALSE, with a Lifetime field of zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.  Host Specification</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1  Host Configuration Variables</h3></a>

   A host that implements the ICMP router discovery messages must allow
   for the following variables to be configured by system management;
   default values are specified so as to make it unnecessary to
   configure any of these variables in many cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For each multicast interface:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PerformRouterDiscovery
                 A flag indicating whether or not the host is to perform
                 ICMP router discovery on the interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: TRUE

   SolicitationAddress
                 The IP destination address to be used for sending
                 Router Solicitations from the interface.  The only
                 permissible values are the all-routers multicast
                 address, 224.0.0.2, or the limited-broadcast address,
                 255.255.255.255.  (The all-routers address is preferred
                 wherever possible, i.e., on any link where all
                 advertising routers support IP multicast.)
                 Default: 224.0.0.2 if the host supports IP multicast on
                 the interface, else 255.255.255.255

   The Host Requirements -- Communication Layers RFC [1], Section
   3.3.1.6, specifies that each host implementation must support a
   configurable list of default router addresses.  The purpose of the
   ICMP router discovery messages is to eliminate the need to configure
   that list in hosts attached to multicast links.  On non-multicast
   links, and on multicast links for which ICMP router discovery is not
   (yet) supported by the routers or is administratively disabled, it
   will continue to be necessary to configure the default router list in
   each host.  Each entry in the list contains (at least) the following
   configurable variables:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RouterAddress
                 An IP address of a default router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: (none)

   PreferenceLevel
                 The preferability of the RouterAddress as a default
                 router address, relative to other router addresses on
                 the same subnet.  The Host Requirements RFC does not
                 specify how this value is to be encoded; to allow the
                 preference level to be conveyed in a Router
                 Advertisement or configured by system management, it is
                 here specified that it be encoded as a 32-bit, signed,
                 twos-complement integer, with higher values meaning
                 more preferable.  The minimum value (hex 80000000) is
                 reserved to mean that the address is not to be used as
                 a default router address, i.e., it is to be used only
                 for specific IP destinations, of which the host has
                 been informed by ICMP Redirect or configuration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Default: 0

	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2  Message Validation by Hosts</h3></a>

   A host must silently discard any received Router Advertisement
   messages that do not satisfy the following validity checks:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - ICMP Checksum is valid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - ICMP Code is 0.

   (i.e., other than the Router Address and Preference Level fields),
   and the contents of any octets beyond the first 8 + (Num Addrs * Addr

   changes to the protocol may specify additional per-address
   information words, or additional octets at the end of the message;
   backward-incompatible changes may use different Code values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An advertisement that passes the validity checks is called a "valid
   advertisement".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A host must silently discard any received Router Solicitation
   messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3  Host Behavior</h3></a>

   On any interface on which the host supports IP multicast, the host
   will be a member of the all-systems IP multicast group (224.0.0.1).
   This occurs automatically, as specified in [4]; no explicit action is
   required on the part of the router discovery protocol implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A host never sends a Router Advertisement message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A host silently discards any Router Advertisement message that
   arrives on an interface for which the host's configured
   PerformRouterDiscovery flag is FALSE, and it never sends a Router
   Solicitation on such an interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A host cannot process an advertisement until it has determined its
   own IP address(es) and subnet mask(s) for the interface on which the
   advertisement is received.  (On some links, a host may be able to use
   some combination of BOOTP [3], RARP [5], or ICMP Address Mask
   messages [7] to discover its own address and mask.)  While waiting to
   learn the address and mask of an interface, a host may save any valid
   advertisements received on that interface for later processing; this
   allows router discovery and address/mask discovery to proceed in
   parallel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To process an advertisement, a host scans the list of router
   addresses contained in it. It ignores any non-neighboring addresses,
   i.e., addresses that do not match one of the host's own addresses on
   the arrival interface, under the subnet mask associated with that
   address.  For each neighboring address, the host does the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - If the address is not already present in the host's default
        router list, a new entry is added to the list, containing
        the address along with its accompanying preference level
        and a timer initialized to the Lifetime value from the
        advertisement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - If the address is already present in the host's default
        router list as a result of a previously-received
        advertisement, its preference level is updated and its
        timer is reset to the values in the newly-received
        advertisement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - If the address is already present in the host's default
        router list as a result of system configuration, no change
        is made to its preference level; there is no timer
        associated with a configured address.  (Note that any
        router addresses acquired from the "Gateway" subfield of
        the vendor extensions field of a BOOTP packet [11] are
        considered to be configured addresses; they are assigned
        the default preference level of zero, and they do not have
        an associated timer.  Note further that any address found
        in the "giaddr" field of a BOOTP packet [3] identifies a
        BOOTP forwarder which is not necessarily an IP router; such
        an address should not be installed in the host's default
        router list.)

   Whenever the timer expires in any entry that was created as a result
   of a received advertisement, that entry is discarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To limit the storage needed for the default router list, a host may
   choose not to store all of the router addresses discovered via
   advertisements.  If so, the host should discard those addresses with
   lower preference levels in favor of those with higher levels.  It is
   desirable to retain more than one default router address in the list
   so that, if the current choice of default router is discovered to be
   down, the host may immediately choose another default router, without
   having to wait for the next advertisement to arrive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any router address advertised with a preference level of hex 80000000
   is not to be used by the host as default router address; such an
   address may be omitted from the default router list, unless its timer
   is being use as a "black-hole" detection mechanism, as discussed in
   Section 4.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be understood that preference levels learned from
   advertisements do not affect any of the host's cached route entries.
   For example, if the host has been redirected to use a particular
   router address to reach a specific IP destination, it continues to
   use that router address for that destination, even if it discovers
   another router address with a higher preference level.  Preference
   levels influence the choice of router only for an IP destination for
   which there is no cached or configured route, or whose cached route
   points to a router that is subsequently discovered to be dead or
   unreachable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A host is permitted (but not required) to transmit up to
   MAX_SOLICITATIONS Router Solicitation messages from any of its
   multicast interfaces after any of the following events:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - The interface is initialized at system startup time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - The interface is reinitialized after a temporary interface
        failure or after being temporarily disabled by system
        management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - The system changes from being a router to being a host, by
        having its IP forwarding capability turned off by system
        management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - The PerformRouterDiscovery flag for the interface is
        changed from FALSE to TRUE by system management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IP destination address of the solicitations is the configured
   SolicitationAddress for the interface.  The IP source address may
   contain zero if the host has not yet determined an address for the
   interface; otherwise it contains one of the interface's addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a host does choose to send a solicitation after one of the above
   events, it should delay that transmission for a random amount of time
   between 0 and MAX_SOLICITATION_DELAY.  This serves to alleviate
   congestion when many hosts start up on a link at the same time, such
   as might happen after recovery from a power failure.  (It is
   recommended that hosts include some unique value, such as one of
   their IP or link-layer addresses, in the seed used to initialize
   their pseudo-random number generators.  Although the randomization
   range is specified in units of seconds, the actual randomly-chosen
   value should not be in units of whole seconds, but rather in units of
   the highest available timer resolution.)

   A host may also choose to further postpone its solicitations,
   subsequent to one of the above events, until the first time it needs
   to use a default router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receiving a valid advertisement containing at least one
   neighboring address whose preference level is other than hex
   80000000, subsequent to one of the above events, the host must desist
   from sending any solicitations on that interface (even if none have
   been sent yet), until the next time one of the above events occurs.
   The small number of retransmissions of a solicitation, which are
   permitted if no such advertisement is received, should be sent at
   intervals of SOLICITATION_INTERVAL seconds, without randomization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.  Protocol Constants</h2></a>

   Router constants:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         MAX_INITIAL_ADVERT_INTERVAL       16 seconds

         MAX_INITIAL_ADVERTISEMENTS        3 transmissions

         MAX_RESPONSE_DELAY                2 seconds

   Host constants:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         MAX_SOLICITATION_DELAY            1 second

         SOLICITATION_INTERVAL             3 seconds

         MAX_SOLICITATIONS                 3 transmissions

   Additional protocol constants are defined with the message formats in
   Section 3, and with the router and host configuration variables in
   Sections 4.1 and 5.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All protocol constants are subject to change in future revisions of
   the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This extension of ICMP makes it possible for any system attached to a
   link to masquerade as a default router for hosts attached to that
   link.  Any traffic sent to such an imposter is vulnerable to
   eavesdropping, to denial of forwarding service, and to modification
   by insertion, deletion, or alteration of packets.  It should be noted
   that, on most multicast or broadcast links on which this protocol is
   expected to operate, eavesdropping is already possible by any system
   attached to the link, and the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) used
   on those links offers a similar opportunity for service denial and
   message stream modification.  For environments where those threats
   are deemed unacceptable, there are configuration variables to disable
   dynamic router discovery by hosts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Router Advertisement message format is defined so as to allow
   additional information to be added to the message in a backward-
   compatible manner.  One possible use of that capability is to add
   digital signatures or some other form of authentication information
   to the advertisements, to enable hosts to verify their authenticity.
   This is FOR FURTHER STUDY.
