                            Discard Process



I suggest that for debugging and measurement purposes those hosts which
are willing implement a "Discard" process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">This discard process would listen for a request for connection and
execute the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) as specified in NIC 7104
the "Current Network Protocols" notebook.  Upon completion of the ICP
the discard process would wait for data from the network.  When data is
received from the network it is discarded at once, (and the buffer space
is re-allocated).  The discard process is terminated by closing the
network connections.
