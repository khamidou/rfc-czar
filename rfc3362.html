</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
   image/t38.  The encoding is defined by ITU Recommendation T.38 and is
   intended for use as an Session Description Protocol (SDP) media
   descriptor.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overview</h2></a>

   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
   image/t38.  The encoding is defined by [T.38] and is intended for use
   as an SDP media descriptor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   T.38 Definition</h2></a>

   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [T.38] describes the technical features
   necessary to transfer facsimile documents in real-time between two
   standard Group 3 facsimile terminals over the Internet or other
   networks using IP protocols.  The Recommendation allows the use of
   either TCP or UDP depending on the service environment.
   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [T.38] Annex D describes system level
   requirements and procedures for internet aware facsimile
   implementations and internet aware facsimile gateways conforming to
   ITU-T T.38 to establish calls with other ITU-T T.38 implementations
   using the procedures defined in IETF RFC 2543 [SIP-99] and IETF RFC
   2327 [SDP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that ITU-T T.38 Recommendation T.38 (04/02) [T.38] is an
   aggregation of the original ITU-T Recommendation T.38 (06/98) [T.38-
   98] and all of the subsequent Amendments and Corrigendum including
   [T.38D-00].  While [T.38] and [T.38D-00] describe SIP procedures per
   [SIP-99], the procedures can also be applied to the revised Session
   Initiation Protocol specification [SIP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   image/t38 Usage</h3></a>

   Annex D of [T.38] describes that the image/t38 media type is intended
   to indicate a T.38 media stream in SDP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This media type registration is not intended for email usage.

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: Binary

      Security considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         This MIME media subtype is intended to be used as a
         parameter by SDP in SIP call setup for T.38 as described in
         ITU-T Rec. T.38 Annex D.  Any use of this media type by
         email applications is not defined and as a result is not
         guaranteed to interoperate with a T.38 stream.
