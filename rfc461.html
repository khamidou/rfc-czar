                  TELNET Protocol Meeting Announcement

Since the publication of RFC #318 there have been a great number of
proposals for changes and/or extensions to the (still unofficial) TELNET
Protocol. It now seems appropriate to have a meeting of concerned
parties to try, once again, to reach a consensus position and define an
"official" protocol (with perhaps, some room for optional expansion).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Accordingly, I hereby announce a TELNET Protocol meeting to be held at
UCLA on Monday, March 5. I  expect this to be a working meeting (rather
than a tutorial to bring new members of the network community up-to-
speed) and therefore wish to invite the attendance of only those
individuals prepared to discuss at LEAST those issues which have already
been raised.  At a minimum, attendees should be familiar with the
following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    RFC 318
    RFC 328
    RFC 340
    RFC 357
    RFC 393
    RFC 426
    RFC 435

A familiarity with deliberations of the TELNET Committee prior to RFC
	<a name="section-318"><h2>318.  would probably also be helpful.  Finally, attendees should be aware</h2></a>
that there are few (no?) Hosts which follow the echo-control conventions
described in RFC 318.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Anyone wishing to attend this meeting should contact Alex McKenzie at
BBN (NIC ident aam) 50 Moulton Street, Cambridge, Mass. 02l38.  My
telephone number is

    (617) 491-1850 ext. 441<br>

When there is some indication of the number of individuals planning to
attend, a meeting room will be selected, a time announced, etc.
