                      NWG Meeting On Network Usage


     M.I.T.'s Project MAC has agreed to host the next Network Working
Group Meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Due to several scheduling
conflicts, the meeting dates indicated in RFC #207 have been moved
ahead two weeks.  Therefore, the meeting is scheduled to commence on
Sunday, October 10 at 12 noon and is scheduled to adjourn on Thursday,
October 14.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Prior to the time, the NWG has been almost entirely concerned
with issues of communications and protocol implementation.  However,
we are now in a transitional phase; implementation efforts have been
substantially completed and usage of the Network has emerged as a
primary concern.  Consequently, the theme of this Network Working
Group Meeting is Network usage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     The meeting will provide an opportunity to 1) demonstrate current
capabilities of host systems, 2) identify areas of application, 3)
address issues concerning users and service centers, 4) provide
updated information on status and recent developments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     There will be three sequential phases to the meeting as indicated
in RFC #207.  The first phase, the system programmers workshop, will
commence on Sunday, October 10 at 12 noon and continue through Monday,
October 11.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     The second phase will begin on Tuesday, October 12 at 9:30 a.m.
In addition to any workshops that may be organized the following
activities are scheduled:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     a)  A Protocol review - this session will be jointly
         chaired by John Postel (UCLA) and Alex McKenzie (BBN)
         and is open to concerned and knowledgeable persons.
         The session is intended to review current standard
         protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     b)  A course in NIC usage - this session will be a tutorial
         in the use of the NIC.  The size of the group is
         limited by the number of available consoles.  To
         register, contact Dick Watson at SRI, (415) 326-6200.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">


                                                                [Page 1]

     c)  TIP Users - this session will be devoted to a
         presentation of the characteristics of a Terminal
         Interface MessAge Processor (TIP) and the use of a
         TIP for accessing remote services.  There will also
         be a discussion period.  The session will be conducted
         by BBN and is open to interested participants.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     The third phase will begin on Wednesday, October 14.  Wednesday's
session will consist of reports on status and recent developments.  In
the morning the following developments will be reported -- the outcome
of the system programmers workshop, results of the Protocol review,
specifications for Network on-line co-operative interaction, NIC
philosophy, status report on user level Protocol development.  The
afternoon will highlight the status of the ILLIAC IV development,
TENEX development, Data Computer development and current activities in
Network Climate Dynamics.  The session will conclude with a discussion
of Network Management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     On Thursday morning representatives of Network service centers
and user groups will hold a round table discussion on access to
service centers via the Network.  This discussion will be open to the
public and audience participation will be invited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Cocktails and dinner are planned for Wednesday evening beginning
at 5:30 p.m.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     More information on the October NWG meeting along with a schedule
listing workshop meeting times and rooms will be available at a later
date.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     All NWG meeting attendees should register for the meeting by
calling Anne Speare at (617) 864-6900 x1458.  A block of rooms has<br>
been reserved at the Hotel Sonesta in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
