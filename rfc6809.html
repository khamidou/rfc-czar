     Mechanism to Indicate Support of Features and Capabilities in
                 the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps.  The
   Feature-Caps header field conveys feature-capability indicators that
   are used to indicate support of features and capabilities for SIP
   entities that are not represented by the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) of the Contact header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact
   header field can convey media feature tags in the Contact header
   field to indicate support of features and capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification also defines feature-capability indicators and
   creates a new IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature Feature-Capability
   Indicator Trees", for registering feature-capability indicators.

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] extension for
   indicating User Agent (UA) capabilities, defined in RFC 3840
   [RFC3840], provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to convey
   information relating to the originator's features and capabilities,
   using the Contact header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps.  The
   Feature-Caps header field conveys feature-capability indicators that
   are used to indicate support of features and capabilities for SIP
   entities that are not represented by the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) of the Contact header field.  Such cases are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The SIP entity acts as a SIP proxy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The SIP entity acts as a SIP registrar.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The SIP entity acts as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)
      [RFC3261], where the Contact header field URI represents another
      SIP entity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact
   header field can convey media feature tags in the Contact header
   field to indicate support of features and capabilities.
   Unlike media feature tags, feature-capability indicators are intended
   to only be used with SIP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification also defines feature-capability indicators and
   creates a new IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature Feature-Capability
   Indicator Trees", for registering feature-capability indicators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Definitions</h2></a>

   Downstream SIP entity: SIP entity in the direction towards which a
   SIP request is sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upstream SIP entity: SIP entity in the direction from which a SIP
   request is received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Feature-Caps Header Field</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Introduction</h3></a>

   The Feature-Caps header field is used by SIP entities to convey
   support of features and capabilities, by setting feature-capability
   indicators.  A feature-capability indicator conveyed in a
   Feature-Caps header field indicates that a SIP entity in the SIP
   message signaling path supports the associated feature and
   capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   User Agent and Proxy Behavior</h3></a>

	<a name="section-4.2.1"><h4>4.2.1   General</h4></a>

   If the URI in a Contact header field of a request or response
   represents a SIP entity, the entity MUST NOT indicate supported
   features and capabilities using a Feature-Caps header field within
   that request or response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a SIP entity receives a SIP request, or response, that contains
   one or more Feature-Caps header fields, the feature-capability
   indicators in the header field inform the entity about the features
   and capabilities supported by entities in the SIP message signaling
   path.  The procedure by which features and capabilities are invoked
   are outside the scope of this specification and MUST be described by
   individual feature-capability indicator specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Feature-Caps header field value cannot convey the address of the
   SIP entity that inserted the Feature-Caps header field.  If
   additional data about a supported feature needs to be conveyed, such
   as the address of the SIP entity that indicated support of the
   feature, then the feature definition needs to define a way to convey
   that information as a value of the associated feature-capability
   indicator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a SIP entity adds a Feature-Caps header field to a SIP message,
   it MUST place the header field before any existing Feature-Caps
   header field in the message to be forwarded, so that the added header
   field becomes the top-most one.  Then, when another SIP entity
   receives a SIP request or the response, the SIP feature-capability
   indicators in the top-most Feature-Caps header field will represent
   the supported features and capabilities "closest", from a SIP
   signaling point of view, to the entity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Based on features and policies, a SIP entity MAY remove a
   Feature-Caps header field from a SIP message.  Also, a SIP entity MAY
   remove a feature-capability indicator from a Feature-Caps header
   field within a SIP message.  A SIP entity SHOULD NOT re-order the
   Feature-Caps header fields within a SIP message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a given fc-value, as defined in Section 6.2.1, the order in which
   feature-capability indicators are listed has no significance.  For
   example, "foo;bar" and "bar;foo" have the same meaning (i.e., that
   the SIP entity that inserted the feature-capability indicator
   supports the features and capabilities associated with the "foo" and
   "bar" feature-capability indicators).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2.2"><h4>4.2.2   B2BUA Behavior</h4></a>

   The procedures in this section apply to User Agents (UAs) [RFC3261]
   that are part of B2BUAs that are referenced in the message by a
   Record-Route header field rather than by the URI of the Contact
   header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When such a UA sends a SIP request, if the UA wants to indicate
   support of features and capabilities towards its downstream SIP
   entities, it inserts a Feature-Caps header field in the request,
   containing one or more feature-capability indicators associated with
   the supported features and capabilities, before it forwards the
   request.
   If the SIP request is triggered by another SIP request that the B2BUA
   has received, the UA MAY forward received Feature-Caps header fields
   by copying them to the outgoing SIP request, similar to a SIP proxy,
   before it inserts its own Feature-Caps header field in the SIP
   request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When such a UA receives a SIP response, if the UA wants to indicate
   support of features and capabilities towards its upstream SIP
   entities, it inserts a Feature-Caps header field in the response,
   containing one or more feature-capability indicators associated with
   the supported features and capabilities, before it forwards the
   response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the SIP response is triggered by another SIP response that the
   B2BUA has received, the UA MAY forward received Feature-Caps header
   fields by copying them to the outgoing SIP response, similar to a SIP
   proxy, before it inserts its own Feature-Caps header field in the SIP
   response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2.3"><h4>4.2.3   Registrar Behavior</h4></a>

   If a SIP registrar wants to indicate support of features and
   capabilities towards its upstream SIP entities, it inserts a
   Feature-Caps header field, containing one or more feature-capability
   indicators associated with the supported features and capabilities,
   in a REGISTER response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2.4"><h4>4.2.4   Proxy Behavior</h4></a>

   When a SIP proxy receives a SIP request, if the proxy wants to
   indicate support of features and capabilities towards its downstream
   SIP entities, it inserts a Feature-Caps header field in the request,
   containing one or more SIP feature-capability indicators associated
   with the supported features and capabilities, before it forwards the
   request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a proxy receives a SIP response, if the proxy wants to indicate
   support of features and capabilities towards its upstream SIP
   entities, it inserts a Feature-Caps header field in the response,

   response.
	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   SIP Message Type and Response Code Semantics</h3></a>

	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   General</h4></a>

   This section describes the general usage and semantics of the
   Feature-Caps header field for different SIP message types and
   response codes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 6.2.1 defines the Feature-Caps header field ABNF.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.2"><h4>4.3.2   SIP Dialog</h4></a>

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within an initial SIP
   request for a dialog, within a target refresh SIP request, and within
   any 18x or 2xx response associated with such requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a feature-capability indicator is inserted in a Feature-Caps
   header field of an initial request for a dialog, or within a response
   of such a request, it indicates to the receivers of the request (or
   response) that the feature associated with the feature-capability
   indicator is supported for the duration of the dialog, until a target
   refresh request is sent for the dialog, or until the dialog is
   terminated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unless a feature-capability indicator is inserted in a Feature-Caps
   header field of a target refresh request, or within a response of
   such a request, it indicates to the receivers of the request (or
   response) that the feature is no longer supported for the dialog.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a given dialog, a SIP entity MUST insert the same feature-
   capability indicators in all 18x and 2xx responses associated with a
   given transaction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As it cannot be guaranteed that 2xx responses associated with SIP
   SUBSCRIBE requests will reach the User Agent Client (UAC) [RFC3261],
   due to forking of the request, entities need to indicate supported
   features and capabilities in the SIP NOTIFY request that will be sent
   for each of the created subscription dialogs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.3"><h4>4.3.3   SIP Registration (REGISTER)</h4></a>

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within a SIP REGISTER
   request and within the 200 (OK) response associated with such a
   request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a feature-capability indicator is conveyed in a Feature-Caps
   header field of a REGISTER request, or within an associated response,
   it indicates to the receivers of the message that the feature
   associated with the feature-capability indicator is supported for the
   registration, until the registration of the contact that was
   explicitly conveyed in the REGISTER request expires, or until the
   registered contact is explicitly refreshed and the refresh REGISTER
   request does not contain the feature-capability indicator associated
   with the feature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While a REGISTER response can contain contacts that have been
   registered as part of other registration transactions, support of any
   indicated feature only applies to requests sent to the contact(s)
   that were explicitly conveyed in the associated REGISTER request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification does not define any semantics for usage of the
   Feature-Caps header field in pure registration binding fetching
   messages (see Section 10.2.3 of RFC 3261), where the REGISTER request
   does not contain a Contact header field.  Unless such semantics are
   defined in a future extension, fetching messages will not have any
   impact on previously indicated support of features and capabilities,
   and SIP entities MUST NOT insert a Feature-Caps header field in such
   messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If SIP outbound [RFC5626] is used, the rules above apply.  However,
   supported features and capabilities only apply for the registration
   flow on which support has been explicitly indicated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.4"><h4>4.3.4   SIP Standalone Transactions</h4></a>

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within a standalone SIP
   request and within any 2xx response associated with such a request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a feature-capability indicator is inserted in a Feature-Caps
   header field of a standalone request, or within a response of such a
   request, it indicates to the receivers of the request (or response)
   that the feature associated with the feature-capability indicator is
   supported for the duration of the standalone transaction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Feature-Capability Indicators</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Introduction</h3></a>

   Feature-capability indicators are used by SIP entities not
   represented by the URI of the Contact header field to indicate
   support of features and capabilities, where media feature tags cannot
   be used to indicate such support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A value, or a list of values, that provides additional information
   about the supported feature or capability can be associated with a
   feature-capability indicator.
	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Registration Trees</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5.2.1"><h4>5.2.1   General</h4></a>

   The following subsections define registration trees, distinguished
   by the use of faceted names (e.g., names of the form
   "tree.feature-name").  The registration trees are defined in the IANA
   "Proxy-Feature Feature-Capability Indicator Trees" registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The trees defined herein are similar to the global tree and SIP tree
   defined for media feature tags, in RFCs 2506 [RFC2506] and 3840
   [RFC3840].  Other registration trees are outside the scope of this
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In contrast to RFCs 2506 and 3840, this specification only defines a
   global tree and a SIP tree, as they are the only trees defined in
   those RFCs that have been used for defining SIP-specific media
   feature tags.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a feature-capability indicator is registered in any registration
   tree, no leading "+" is used in the registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.2"><h4>5.2.2   Global Tree</h4></a>

   The global feature-capability indicator tree is similar to the media
   feature tag global tree defined in RFC 2506 [RFC2506].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A feature-capability indicator in the global tree will be
   distinguished by the leading facet "g.".  An organization can propose
   either a designation indicative of the feature (e.g., "g.blinktags")
   or a faceted designation including the organization name (e.g.,
   "g.organization.blinktags").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.3"><h4>5.2.3   SIP Tree</h4></a>

   The SIP feature-capability indicator tree is similar to the media
   feature tag SIP tree defined in RFC 3840.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A feature-capability indicator in the SIP tree will be distinguished
   by the leading facet "sip.".
	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Feature-Capability Indicator Specification Requirements</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5.3.1"><h4>5.3.1   General</h4></a>

   A feature-capability indicator specification MUST address the issues
   defined in the following subsections or document why an issue is not
   applicable for the specific feature-capability indicator.  A
   reference to the specification MUST be provided when the feature-
   capability indicator is registered with IANA (see Section 8).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is bad practice for feature-capability indicator specifications to
   repeat procedures (e.g., general procedures on the usage of the
   Feature-Caps header field and feature-capability indicators) defined
   in this specification, unless needed for clarification or emphasis
   purposes.  A feature-capability indicator specification MUST NOT
   modify the Feature-Caps header field rules and semantics defined in
   Section 4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A feature-capability indicator specification MUST NOT weaken any
   behavior designated with "SHOULD" or "MUST" in this specification.
   However, a specification MAY strengthen "SHOULD", "MAY", or
   "RECOMMENDED" requirements to "MUST" strength if features and
   capabilities associated with the feature-capability indicator
   require it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.2"><h4>5.3.2   Overall Description</h4></a>

   The feature-capability indicator specification MUST contain an
   overall description of the feature-capability indicator: how it is
   used to indicate support of a feature, a description of the feature
   associated with the feature-capability indicator, a description of
   any additional information (conveyed using one or more feature-
   capability indicator values) that can be conveyed together with the
   feature-capability indicator, and a description of how the associated
   feature MAY be exercised/invoked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.3"><h4>5.3.3   Feature-Capability Indicator Values</h4></a>

   A feature-capability indicator can have an associated value, or a
   list of values.  The feature-capability indicator specification MUST
   define the syntax and semantics of any value defined for the feature-
   capability indicator, including possible restrictions related to the
   usage of a specific value.  The feature-capability indicator
   specification MUST define the value(s) in accordance with the ABNF
   defined in Section 6.3.2.  The feature-capability indicator
   specification MUST define whether the feature-capability indicator
   has a default value.
   If no values are defined for the feature-capability indicator, it
   MUST be indicated in the feature-capability indicator specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A feature-capability indicator value is only applicable for the
   feature-capability indicator for which it has been defined.  For
   other feature-capability indicators, the value has to be defined
   explicitly, even if the semantics are identical.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is strongly RECOMMENDED to not re-use a value that already has
   been defined for another feature-capability indicator, unless the
   semantics of the values are the same.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.4"><h4>5.3.4   Usage Restrictions</h4></a>

   If there are restrictions on how SIP entities can insert a feature-
   capability indicator, the feature-capability indicator specification
   MUST document such restrictions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There might be restrictions related to whether or not entities

   o  are allowed to insert a feature-capability indicator in
      registration-related messages, standalone transaction messages, or
      dialog-related messages,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.5"><h4>5.3.5   Interoperability Considerations</h4></a>

   The feature-capability indicator specification MUST document any
   specific interoperability considerations that apply to the feature-
   capability indicator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interoperability considerations can, e.g., include procedures related
   to cases where an expected feature-capability indicator is not
   present or where it contains an unexpected value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.6"><h4>5.3.6   Security Considerations</h4></a>

   The feature-capability indicator specification MUST document any
   specific security considerations that apply to the feature-capability
   indicator.
	<a name="section-5.3.7"><h4>5.3.7   Examples</h4></a>

   It is recommended that the feature-capability indicator specification
   provide demonstrative message flow diagrams, paired with complete
   messages and message descriptions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that example message flows are by definition informative and do
   not replace normative text.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.8"><h4>5.3.8   Other Information</h4></a>

   If there is additional information about the feature-capability
   indicator, it is recommended to describe such information.  It can
   include, for example, names of related feature-capability indicators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Syntax</h2></a>

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   General</h3></a>

   This section defines the ABNF for the Feature-Caps header field and
   for the feature-capability indicators.  The ABNF defined in this

   In a feature-capability indicator name (ABNF: fcap-name), dots can be
   used to implement a feature-capability indicator tree hierarchy
   (e.g., tree.feature.subfeature).  The description of usage of such a
   tree hierarchy must be described when registered.
	<a name="section-6.3.2"><h4>6.3.2   ABNF</h4></a>

   The ABNF for the feature-capability indicator is:

	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The security issues for feature-capability indicators are similar to
   the ones defined in RFC 3840 for media feature tags.  Media feature
   tags can reveal information about end users and end-user equipment,
   which can be used for industrial espionage.  The knowledge about end-
   user equipment capabilities can also be used to influence application
   behavior.  As feature-capability indicators are not intended to
   convey capability information of end-user devices, such end-user
   security aspects of RFC 3840 do not apply to feature-capability
   indicators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, the security issue discussed in RFC 3840 regarding an
   attacker using the SIP caller preferences extension [RFC3841] in
   order to affect routing decisions does not apply, as the mechanism is
   not defined to be used with feature-capability indicators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Feature-capability indicators can, however, provide capability and
   characteristics information about the SIP entity, some of which might
   be sensitive.  Malicious elements viewing the indicators may be able
   to discern application deployment details or identify elements with
   exploitable feature implementation weaknesses.  The Feature-Caps
   header field does not convey address information about SIP entities.
   However, individual feature-capability indicators might provide
   address information as feature-capability indicator values.
   Therefore, if the feature-capability indicators provide information
   that requires data integrity or origin authentication, mechanisms for
   providing those MUST be provided.  If confidentiality is required,
   then the specification MUST call for the use of Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC5246] at all hops.  Since there are no
   satisfactory middle-to-end or middle-to-middle SIP confidentiality
   mechanisms, TLS is as good as it gets, and specifications SHOULD NOT
   define feature-capability indicators that need confidentiality that
   is better than the hop-by-hop confidentiality provided by TLS.
