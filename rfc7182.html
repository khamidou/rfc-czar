          Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions
                  for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document revises, extends, and replaces RFC 6622.  It describes
   general and flexible TLVs for representing cryptographic Integrity
   Check Values (ICVs) and timestamps, using the generalized Mobile Ad
   Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message format defined in RFC 5444.  It
   defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs
   for affixing ICVs and timestamps to a packet, a message, and one or
   more addresses, respectively.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document specifies a syntactical representation of security-
   related information for use with [RFC5444] addresses, messages, and
   packets.  It also specifies IANA registrations of TLV types and type
   extension registries for these TLV types.  This specification does
   not represent a stand-alone protocol, but it is intended for use by
   MANET routing protocols or security extensions thereof.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Specifically, this document, which revises, extends, and replaces
   [RFC6622], specifies:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Two kinds of TLV: one for carrying Integrity Check Values (ICVs)
      and one for timestamps in packets, messages, and Address Blocks as
      defined by [RFC5444].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A generic framework for use of these TLVs, accounting for specific
      features of Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  IANA registrations for TLVs, and registries for TLV type
      extensions, replacing those from [RFC6622].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies IANA registries for recording code points for
   ICV TLVs and TIMESTAMP TLVs, as well as timestamps, hash functions,
   and cryptographic functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Moreover, in Section 12, this document defines the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A method for generating ICVs using a combination of a
      cryptographic function and a hash function and for including such
      ICVs in the value field of a TLV.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Differences from RFC 6622</h3></a>

   This document obsoletes [RFC6622], replacing that document as the
   specification of two TLV types, TIMESTAMP and ICV, for packets,
   messages and Address Blocks.  For the ICV type, this document
   specifies a new type extension, 2 (see Section 12), in addition to
   including the original type extensions (0 and 1) from [RFC6622].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The TLV value of an ICV TLV with type extension = 2 has the same
   internal structure as an ICV TLV with type extension = 1 but is
   calculated also over the source address of the IP datagram carrying
   the packet, message, or Address Block.  The rationale for adding this
   type extension is that some MANET protocols, such as [RFC6130], use
   the IP source address of the IP datagram carrying the packet,
   message, or Address Block, e.g., to identify links with neighbor
   routers.  If this address is not otherwise contained in the packet,
   message, or Address Block payload (which is permitted, e.g., in
   [RFC6130]), then the address is not protected against tampering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document also incorporates a number of editorial improvements
   over [RFC6622].  In particular, it makes it clear that an ICV TLV may
   be used to carry a truncated ICV and that a single or multivalue
   TIMESTAMP or ICV Address Block TLV may cover more than one address.
   Moreover, to be consistent with the terminology in [RFC5444], the
   name of the TLVs specified in this document have changed from "Packet
   ICV TLV" to "ICV Packet TLV" and from "Packet TIMESTAMP TLV" to
   "TIMESTAMP Packet TLV" (and similar for Message and Address Block
   TLVs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A normative requirement in Section 9.2 has changed from SHOULD to
   MUST in the following sentence:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If a message contains one or more TIMESTAMP TLVs and one or more
      ICV TLVs, then the TIMESTAMP TLVs (as well as any other Message
      TLVs) MUST be added to the message before the ICV TLVs....

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].
   This document uses the terminology and notation defined in [RFC5444].
   In particular, the following TLV fields and notation from [RFC5444]
   are used in this specification:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <msg-hop-limit>  is the hop limit of a message, as specified in
      Section 5.2 of [RFC5444].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <msg-hop-count>  is the hop count of a message, as specified in
      Section 5.2 of [RFC5444].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <length>  is the length of the value field in a TLV in octets, as
      specified in Section 5.4.1 of [RFC5444].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   single-length  is the length of a single value in the value field in
      a TLV in octets, as specified in Section 5.4.1 of [RFC5444].  (It
      is equal to <length> except in a multivalue Address Block TLV.)

   In addition to using the regular expressions defined in Section 2.1.1
   of [RFC5444], this document defines the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   + - One or more occurrences of the preceding element or group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Applicability Statement</h2></a>

   MANET routing protocols using the format defined in [RFC5444] are
   accorded the ability to carry additional information in control
   messages and packets through the inclusion of TLVs.  Information so
   included MAY be used by a MANET routing protocol, or by an extension
   of a MANET routing protocol, according to its specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies how to include an ICV for a packet, a
   message, and addresses in an Address Block within a message, using
   such TLVs.  This document also specifies how to treat an empty Packet
   TLV Block, and "mutable" fields, specifically the <msg-hop-count> and
   <msg-hop-limit> fields, if present in the Message Header when
   calculating ICVs, such that the resulting ICV can be correctly
   verified by any recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes a generic framework for creating ICVs, and
   how to include these ICVs in TLVs.  In Section 12, an example method
   for calculating such ICVs is given, using a cryptographic function
   and a hash function, for which two TLV type extensions are allocated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document does not specify a protocol.  Protocol specifications
   that make use of the framework, specified in this document, will
   reference this document in a normative way, and they may require the
   implementation of some or all of the algorithms described in this
   document.  As this document does not specify a protocol itself, key
   management and key exchange mechanisms are out of scope and may be
   specified in the protocol or protocol extension using this
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Architecture</h2></a>

   MANET routing protocol specifications may have a clause allowing a
   control message to be rejected as "badly formed" or "insecure" prior
   to the message being processed or forwarded.  In particular, MANET
   routing protocols such as the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
   [RFC6130] and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2
   [RFC7181] recognize external reasons (such as failure to verify an
   ICV) for rejecting a message that would be considered "invalid for
   processing".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This architecture is a result of the observation that with respect to
   security in MANETs, "one size rarely fits all" and that MANET routing
   protocol deployment domains have varying security requirements
   ranging from "unbreakable" to "virtually none".  The virtue of this
   approach is that MANET routing protocol specifications (and
   implementations) can remain "generic", with extensions providing
   proper security mechanisms specific to a deployment domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MANET routing protocol "security architecture", in which this
   specification situates itself, can therefore be summarized as
   follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  MANET routing protocol specifications, each with a clause allowing
      an extension to reject a message (prior to processing/forwarding)
      as "badly formed" or "insecure".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  MANET routing protocol security extensions, each rejecting
      messages as "badly formed" or "insecure", as appropriate for a
      given security requirement specific to a deployment domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Code points and an exchange format for information, necessary for
      specification of such MANET routing protocol security extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document addresses the last of the points above, by specifying a
   common exchange format for cryptographic ICVs and timestamps, making
   reservations from within the Packet TLV, Message TLV, and Address
   Block TLV registries of [RFC5444], to be used by (and shared among)
   MANET routing protocol security extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the specific decomposition of an ICV using a cryptographic
   function and a hash function (specified in Section 12), this document
   specifies two IANA registries (see Section 13) for code points for
   hash functions and cryptographic functions.
   With respect to [RFC5444], this document is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Intended to be used in the non-normative, but intended, mode of
      use described in Appendix B of [RFC5444].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A specific example of the Security Considerations section of
      [RFC5444] (the authentication part).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Overview and Functioning</h2></a>

   This document specifies a syntactical representation of security-
   related information for use with [RFC5444] addresses, messages, and
   packets, and also specifies IANA registrations (see Section 13) of
   TLV types and type extension registries for these TLV types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Moreover, this document provides guidelines for how MANET routing
   protocols, and MANET routing protocol extensions using this
   specification, should treat ICV and Timestamp TLVs, and mutable
   fields in messages.  This specification does not represent a stand-
   alone protocol.  MANET routing protocols, and MANET routing protocol
   extensions using this specification, MUST provide instructions as to
   how to handle packets, messages, and addresses with security
   information, associated as specified in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies TLV type assignments (see Section 13) from
   the registries defined for Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs in
   [RFC5444].  When a TLV type is assigned from one of these registries,
   a registry for type extensions for that TLV type is created by IANA.
   This document specifies these type extension registries, in order to
   specify internal structure (and accompanying processing) of the
   <value> field of a TLV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, and as specified in this document, an ICV TLV with type
   extension = 0 specifies that the <value> field has no predefined
   internal structure, but is simply a sequence of octets.  An ICV TLV
   with type extension = 1 specifies that the <value> field has a
   predefined internal structure and defines its interpretation.  An ICV
   TLV with type extension = 2 (added in this document) is the same as
   an ICV TLV with type extension = 1, except that the integrity
   protection also covers the source address of the IP datagram carrying
   the packet, message, or Address Block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Specifically, with type extension = 1 or type extension = 2, the
   <value> field contains the result of combining a cryptographic
   function and a hash function, calculated over the contents of the
   packet, message, or Address Block.  The <value> field contains sub-
   fields indicating which hash function and cryptographic function have
   been used, as specified in Section 12.
   Other documents can request assignments for other type extensions; if
   they do so, they MUST specify their internal structure (if any) and
   interpretation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   General ICV TLV Structure</h2></a>

   The value of the ICV TLV is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <value> := <ICV-value>+

   where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <ICV-value> is a field, of length <length> octets (except in a
      multivalue Address Block TLV, where each <ICV-value> is of length
      single-length octets) that contains the information to be
      interpreted by the ICV verification process, as specified by the
      type extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that this does not specify how to calculate the <ICV-value> nor
   the internal structure thereof, if any; such information MUST be
   specified by the type extension for the ICV TLV type; see Section 13.
   This document specifies three such type extensions: one for ICVs
   without predefined structures and two for ICVs constructed combining
   a cryptographic function and a hash function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   General Timestamp TLV Structure</h2></a>

   The value of the Timestamp TLV is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <value> := <time-value>+

   where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <time-value> is a field, of length <length> octets (except in a
      multivalue Address Block TLV, where each <time-value> is of length
      single-length octets) that contains the timestamp.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that this does not specify how to calculate the <time-value> nor
   the internal structure thereof, if any; such information MUST be
   specified by the type extension for the TIMESTAMP TLV type; see
   Section 13.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A timestamp is essentially "freshness information".  As such, its
   setting and interpretation are to be determined by the MANET routing
   protocol, or MANET routing protocol extension, that uses the
   timestamp and can, for example, correspond to a POSIX timestamp, GPS
   timestamp, or a simple sequence number.  Note that ensuring time
   synchronization in a MANET may be difficult because of the
   decentralized architecture as well as highly dynamic topology due to
   mobility or other factors.  It is out of scope for this document to
   specify a time synchronization mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Packet TLVs</h2></a>

   Two Packet TLVs are defined: one for including the cryptographic ICV
   of a packet and one for including the timestamp indicating the time
   at which the cryptographic ICV was calculated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.1"><h3>8.1   ICV Packet TLV</h3></a>

   An ICV Packet TLV is an example of an ICV TLV as described in
   Section 6.  When determining the <ICV-value> for a packet, and adding
   an ICV Packet TLV to a packet, the following considerations MUST be
   applied:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Because packets as defined in [RFC5444] are never forwarded by
      routers, no special considerations are required regarding mutable
      fields (i.e., <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>), if present
      within any messages in the packet, when calculating the ICV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Any ICV Packet TLVs already present in the Packet TLV Block MUST
      be removed before calculating the ICV, and the Packet TLV Block
      size MUST be recalculated accordingly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the Packet TLV Block now contains no Packet TLVs, the Packet
      TLV Block MUST be removed, and the phastlv bit in the <pkt-flags>
      field in the Packet Header MUST be cleared ('0').

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Any removed ICV Packet TLVs MUST be restored after having
      calculated the ICV, and the Packet TLV Block size MUST be
      recalculated accordingly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  When any removed ICV Packet TLVs, and the newly calculated ICV
      Packet TLV, are added to the packet, if there is no Packet TLV
      Block, then one MUST be added, including setting ('1') the phastlv
      bit in the <pkt-flags> field in the Packet Header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The rationale for removing any ICV Packet TLVs already present prior
   to calculating the ICV is that several ICV TLVs may be added to the
   same packet, e.g., using different ICV cryptographic and/or hash
   functions.  The rationale for removing an empty Packet TLV Block is
   because the receiver of the packet cannot tell the difference between
   what was an absent Packet TLV Block, and what was an empty Packet TLV
   Block when removing and verifying the ICV Packet TLV if no other
   Packet TLVs are present.
	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   TIMESTAMP Packet TLV</h3></a>

   A TIMESTAMP Packet TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as described
   in Section 7.  If a packet contains one or more TIMESTAMP TLVs and
   one or more ICV TLVs, then the TIMESTAMP TLVs (as well as any other
   Packet TLVs) MUST be added to the packet before the ICV TLVs, in
   order to include the timestamps and other TLVs in the calculation of
   the ICVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Message TLVs</h2></a>

   Two Message TLVs are defined: one for including the cryptographic ICV
   of a message and one for including the timestamp indicating the time
   at which the cryptographic ICV was calculated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.1"><h3>9.1   ICV Message TLV</h3></a>

   An ICV Message TLV is an example of an ICV TLV as described in
   Section 6.  When determining the <ICV-value> for a message, the
   following considerations MUST be applied:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The fields <msg-hop-limit> and <msg-hop-count>, if present in the
      Message Header, MUST both be assumed to have the value 0 (zero)
      when calculating the ICV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Any ICV Message TLVs already present in the Message TLV Block MUST
      be removed before calculating the ICV, and the message size as
      well as the Message TLV Block size MUST be recalculated
      accordingly.  Also, all relevant TLVs other than ICV TLVs MUST be
      added prior to ICV value calculation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Any removed ICV Message TLVs MUST be restored after having
      calculated the ICV, and the message size as well as the Message
      TLV Block size MUST be recalculated accordingly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The rationale for removing any ICV Message TLVs already present prior
   to calculating the ICV is that several ICV TLVs may be added to the

   functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.2"><h3>9.2   TIMESTAMP Message TLV</h3></a>

   A TIMESTAMP Message TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as described
   in Section 7.  If a message contains one or more TIMESTAMP TLVs and
   one or more ICV TLVs, then the TIMESTAMP TLVs (as well as any other
   Message TLVs) MUST be added to the message before the ICV TLVs, in
   order to include the timestamps and other Message TLVs in the
   calculation of the ICV.
	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Address Block TLVs</h2></a>

   Two Address Block TLVs are defined: one for associating a
   cryptographic ICV to one or more addresses and their associated
   information and one for including the timestamp indicating the time
   at which the cryptographic ICV was calculated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.1"><h3>10.1   ICV Address Block TLV</h3></a>

   An ICV Address Block TLV is an example of an ICV TLV as described in
   Section 6.  The ICV is calculated over one or more addresses,
   concatenated with any other values -- for example, other Address
   Block TLV <value> fields -- associated with those addresses.  A MANET
   routing protocol, or MANET routing protocol extension, using ICV
   Address Block TLVs MUST specify how to include any such concatenated
   attributes of the addresses in the calculation and verification
   processes for the ICV.  When determining an <ICV-value> for one or
   more addresses, the following consideration MUST be applied:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If other TLV values are concatenated with the addresses for
      calculating the ICV, the corresponding TLVs MUST NOT be ICV
      Address Block TLVs already associated with any of the addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The rationale for not concatenating the addresses with any ICV TLV
   values already associated with the addresses when calculating the ICV
   is that several ICVs may be added to the same address or addresses,
   e.g., using different ICV cryptographic and/or hash functions, and
   the order of addition is not known to the recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10.2"><h3>10.2   TIMESTAMP Address Block TLV</h3></a>

   A TIMESTAMP Address Block TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as
   described in Section 7.  If one or more TIMESTAMP TLVs and one or
   more ICV TLVs are associated with an address, the relevant TIMESTAMP
   TLV <time-value>(s) MUST be included before calculating the value of
   the ICV to be contained in the ICV TLV value (i.e., concatenated with
   the associated addresses and any other values as described in
   Section 10.1).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   ICV: Basic</h2></a>

   The basic ICV, represented by way of an ICV TLV with type
   extension = 0, has as TLV value a simple bit-field without specified
   structure (i.e, without explicitly included hash function, crypto
   function, key ID or other parameters).  Moreover, it is not specified
   how to calculate the <ICV-value>.  It is assumed that the mechanism
   specifying how ICVs are calculated and verified, as well as which
   parameters (if any) need to be exchanged prior to using the TLV with
   type extension = 0, is established outside of this specification,
   e.g., by administrative configuration or external out-of-band
   signaling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The <ICV-value>, when using type extension = 0, is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <ICV-value> := <ICV-data>

   where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <ICV-data> is a field, of length <length> octets (or single-length
      octets in a multivalue Address Block TLV) that contains the
      cryptographic ICV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12"><h2>12.   ICV: Hash Function and Cryptographic Function</h2></a>

   One common way of calculating an ICV is combining a cryptographic
   function and a hash function applied to the content.  This
   decomposition is specified in this section, using either type
   extension = 1 or type extension = 2, in the ICV TLVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12.1"><h3>12.1   General ICV TLV Structure</h3></a>

   The following data structure allows representation of a cryptographic
   ICV, including specification of the appropriate hash function and
   cryptographic function used for calculating the ICV:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <ICV-value> := <hash-function>
                     <cryptographic-function>
                     <key-id-length>
                     <key-id>?
                     <ICV-data>

   where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <hash-function> is a one-octet unsigned integer field specifying
      the hash function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <cryptographic-function> is a one-octet unsigned integer field
      specifying the cryptographic function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <key-id-length> is a one-octet unsigned integer field specifying
      the length of the <key-id> field as a number of octets.  The value
      zero (0x00) is reserved for using a single pre-installed, shared
      key.
      <key-id> is a field specifying the key identifier of the key that
      was used to calculate the ICV of the message, which allows unique
      identification of different keys with the same originator.  It is
      the responsibility of each key originator to make sure that
      actively used keys that it issues have distinct key identifiers.
      If <key-id-length> equals zero (0x00), the <key-id> field is not
      contained in the TLV, and a single pre-installed, shared key is
      used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      <ICV-data> is a field with length <length> - 3 - <key-id-length>
      octets (except in a multivalue Address Block TLV, in which it is
      single-length - 3 - <key-id-length> octets) and that contains the
      cryptographic ICV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The version of this TLV, specified in this section, assumes that,
   unless otherwise specified, calculating the ICV can be decomposed
   into:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ICV-value = cryptographic-function(hash-function(content))

   In some cases, a different combination of cryptographic function and
   hash function may be specified.  This is the case for the Hashed
   Message Authentication Code (HMAC) function, which is specified as
   defined in Section 13.12, using the hash function twice.  Using
   cryptographic-function "none" is provided for symmetry and possible
   future use, but it SHOULD NOT be used with any currently specified
   hash function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The difference between the two type extensions is that in addition to
   the information covered by the ICV using type extension = 1 (which is
   detailed in the following sections), the ICV using type extension = 2
   also MUST cover the source address of the IP datagram carrying the
   corresponding packet, message, or Address Block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The <ICV-data> field MAY be truncated after being calculated, this is
   indicated by its length, calculated as described above.  The
   truncation MUST be as specified for the relevant cryptographic
   function (and, if appropriate, hash function).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  When using truncation, the guidelines for minimal ICV length set
      out in [NIST-SP-800-107] MUST be followed.  In particular the
      <ICV-data> field when using HMAC MUST NOT be truncated below 4
      octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The truncated ICV length MUST be so large that the probability of
      success of a dictionary attack is acceptably small.  Such a
      success will arise if the ICV of a spoofed packet or message is
      verified.  The probability of success is a function of (a) how
      many routers can be attacked, (b) how fast a router can receive
      packets or messages and attempt to verify their ICV, (c) the
      truncated ICV length, and (d) the lifetime of the network.  If the
      truncated ICV length in bits is L, then 2^L packets or messages
      are required to attack with certainty of success.  With a
      verification rate of R packets/messages per second, applied to N
      routers over an available time of T, the probability of success is
      given by NRT/2^L.  If this is not to exceed a probability of P,
      then L > log2(NRT/P).  For example, if N is 32, R is 1000, T is
      86400 (I day) and P is 10^-6, then L must be at least 52 bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some of the cryptographic and hash functions listed in Section 13
   require the length of the content to be digitally signed to be a
   multiple of a certain number of octets.  As a consequence, they
   specify padding mechanisms, e.g., AES-CMAC [RFC4493] specifies a
   padding mechanism for message lengths that are not equal to a
   multiple of 16 octets.  Implementations of the framework in this
   document MUST support appropriate padding mechanisms, as specified in
   the cryptographic or hash function specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The hash function and the cryptographic function correspond to the
   entries in two IANA registries, which are described in Section 13.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12.1.1"><h4>12.1.1   Rationale</h4></a>

   The rationale for separating the hash function and the cryptographic
   function into two octets instead of having all combinations in a
   single octet -- possibly as a TLV type extension -- is that adding
   further hash functions or cryptographic functions in the future may
   lead to a non-contiguous number space as well as a smaller overall
   space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The rationale for not including a field that lists parameters of the
   cryptographic ICV in the TLV is that, before being able to validate a
   cryptographic ICV, routers have to exchange or acquire keys.  Any
   additional parameters can be provided together with the keys in that
   bootstrap process.  Therefore, it is not necessary, and would even
   entail an extra overhead, to transmit the parameters within every
   message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The rationale for the addition of type extension = 2 is that the
   source address is used in some cases, such as when processing HELLO
   messages in [RFC6130].  This is applicable only to packets (which
   only ever travel one hop) and messages (and their Address Blocks)
   that only travel one hop.  It is not applicable to messages that may
   be forwarded more than one hop, such as Topology Control (TC)
   messages in [RFC7181].
	<a name="section-12.1.2"><h4>12.1.2   Parameters</h4></a>

   As described in Section 12.1.1, parameters are selected
   administratively on each router before using this framework in a
   MANET, in addition to exchanging the keys between MANET routers.
   This was a design decision in [RFC6622] and is kept in this
   specification for reasons of backwards compatibility.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following parameters are RECOMMENDED and SHOULD be those chosen
   administratively, unless there are good reasons otherwise:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Signature scheme: RSASSA-PSS with the default parameters:
         rSASSA-PSS-Default-Identifier (as defined in [RFC3447])

      *  Common exponent: 65537

   o  For crypto function ECDSA:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Curve name: exchanged as part of key distribution

      *  Hash function: The hash function MUST be pinned to the curve,
         i.e., use SHA-256 for the p-256 curve, SHA-384 for p-384, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  For crypto function AES:

	<a name="section-14"><h2>14.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document does not specify a protocol.  It provides a syntactical
   component for cryptographic ICVs of messages and packets, as defined
   in [RFC5444].  It can be used to address security issues of a MANET
   routing protocol or MANET routing protocol extension.  As such, it
   has the same security considerations as [RFC5444].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, a MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol
   extension that uses this specification MUST specify how to use the
   framework and the TLVs presented in this document.  In addition, the
   protection that the MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol
   extensions attain by using this framework MUST be described.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As an example, a MANET routing protocol that uses this component to
   reject "badly formed" or "insecure" messages if a control message
   does not contain a valid ICV SHOULD indicate the security assumption
   that if the ICV is valid, the message is considered valid.  It also
   SHOULD indicate the security issues that are counteracted by this
   measure (e.g., link or identity spoofing) as well as the issues that
   are not counteracted (e.g., compromised keys).
