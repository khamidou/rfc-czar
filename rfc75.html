                            Network Meeting


Taking advantage of the FJCC in Houston, I have scheduled a meeting of
the Network Working Group in room Astro VII of the Astroworld Hotel at
	<a name="section-8"><h2>8. :00 p.m.  on Monday, November 16, 1970.</h2></a>

The purpose of this meeting is to discuss several topics related to
the practical use of the network. I have in mind:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (a) accounting mechanisms

      (b) documentation distribution

      (c) person-to-person message sending and message storing

      (d) access to systems by foreign users

Attendees are invited to raise other topics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">I envision that this meeting will spawn smaller subsidiary meetings
during the FJCC to pursue these or related topics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Prospective attendees should notify my secretary Benita Kirstel (213)
	<a name="section-825"><h2>825. -2368 so that we can be sure the room is large enough. Unexpected</h2></a>
attendees are nevertheless invited.
