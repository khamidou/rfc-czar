</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
   formats for carrying each of MPEG-4 Audio and MPEG-4 Visual
   bitstreams without using MPEG-4 Systems.  For the purpose of directly
   mapping MPEG-4 Audio/Visual bitstreams onto RTP packets, it provides
   specifications for the use of RTP header fields and also specifies
   fragmentation rules.  It also provides specifications for
   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type registrations and
   the use of Session Description Protocol (SDP).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   The RTP payload formats described in this document specify how MPEG-4
   Audio [3][5] and MPEG-4 Visual streams [2][4] are to be fragmented
   and mapped directly onto RTP packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These RTP payload formats enable transport of MPEG-4 Audio/Visual
   streams without using the synchronization and stream management
   functionality of MPEG-4 Systems [6].  Such RTP payload formats will
   be used in systems that have intrinsic stream management
   functionality and thus require no such functionality from MPEG-4
   Systems.  H.323 terminals are an example of such systems, where
   MPEG-4 Audio/Visual streams are not managed by MPEG-4 Systems Object
   Descriptors but by H.245.  The streams are directly mapped onto RTP
   packets without using MPEG-4 Systems Sync Layer.  Other examples are
   SIP and RTSP where MIME and SDP are used.  MIME types and SDP usages
   of the RTP payload formats described in this document are defined to
   directly specify the attribute of Audio/Visual streams (e.g., media
   type, packetization format and codec configuration) without using
   MPEG-4 Systems.  The obvious benefit is that these MPEG-4
   Audio/Visual RTP payload formats can be handled in an unified way
   together with those formats defined for non-MPEG-4 codecs.  The
   disadvantage is that interoperability with environments using MPEG-4
   Systems may be difficult, other payload formats may be better suited
   to those applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The semantics of RTP headers in such cases need to be clearly
   defined, including the association with MPEG-4 Audio/Visual data
   elements.  In addition, it is beneficial to define the fragmentation
   rules of RTP packets for MPEG-4 Video streams so as to enhance error
   resiliency by utilizing the error resilience tools provided inside
   the MPEG-4 Video stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1  MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload format</h3></a>

   MPEG-4 Visual is a visual coding standard with many new features:
   high coding efficiency; high error resiliency; multiple, arbitrary
   shape object-based coding; etc. [2].  It covers a wide range of
   bitrates from scores of Kbps to several Mbps.  It also covers a wide
   variety of networks, ranging from those guaranteed to be almost
   error-free to mobile networks with high error rates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With respect to the fragmentation rules for an MPEG-4 Visual
   bitstream defined in this document, since MPEG-4 Visual is used for a
   wide variety of networks, it is desirable not to apply too much
   restriction on fragmentation, and a fragmentation rule such as "a
   single video packet shall always be mapped on a single RTP packet"
   may be inappropriate.  On the other hand, careless, media unaware
   fragmentation may cause degradation in error resiliency and bandwidth
   efficiency.  The fragmentation rules described in this document are
   flexible but manage to define the minimum rules for preventing
   meaningless fragmentation while utilizing the error resilience
   functionalities of MPEG-4 Visual.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The fragmentation rule recommends not to map more than one VOP in an
   RTP packet so that the RTP timestamp uniquely indicates the VOP time
   framing.  On the other hand, MPEG-4 video may generate VOPs of very
   small size, in cases with an empty VOP (vop_coded=0) containing only
   VOP header or an arbitrary shaped VOP with a small number of coding
   blocks.  To reduce the overhead for such cases, the fragmentation
   rule permits concatenating multiple VOPs in an RTP packet.  (See
   fragmentation rule (4) in section 3.2 and marker bit and timestamp in<br>
   section 3.1.)

   While the additional media specific RTP header defined for such video
   coding tools as H.261 or MPEG-1/2 is effective in helping to recover
   picture headers corrupted by packet losses, MPEG-4 Visual has already
   error resilience functionalities for recovering corrupt headers, and
   these can be used on RTP/IP networks as well as on other networks
   (H.223/mobile, MPEG-2/TS, etc.).  Therefore, no extra RTP header
   fields are defined in this MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2  MPEG-4 Audio RTP payload format</h3></a>

   MPEG-4 Audio is a new kind of audio standard that integrates many
   different types of audio coding tools.  Low-overhead MPEG-4 Audio
   Transport Multiplex (LATM) manages the sequences of audio data with
   relatively small overhead.  In audio-only applications, then, it is
   desirable for LATM-based MPEG-4 Audio bitstreams to be directly
   mapped onto the RTP packets without using MPEG-4 Systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While LATM has several multiplexing features as follows;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Carrying configuration information with audio data,
   -  Concatenation of multiple audio frames in one audio stream,
   -  Multiplexing multiple objects (programs),
   -  Multiplexing scalable layers,

   in RTP transmission there is no need for the last two features.
   Therefore, these two features MUST NOT be used in applications based
   on RTP packetization specified by this document.  Since LATM has been
   developed for only natural audio coding tools, i.e., not for
   synthesis tools, it seems difficult to transmit Structured Audio (SA)
   data and Text to Speech Interface (TTSI) data by LATM.  Therefore, SA
   data and TTSI data MUST NOT be transported by the RTP packetization
   in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For transmission of scalable streams, audio data of each layer SHOULD
   be packetized onto different RTP packets allowing for the different
   layers to be treated differently at the IP level, for example via
   some means of differentiated service.  On the other hand, all
   configuration data of the scalable streams are contained in one LATM
   configuration data "StreamMuxConfig" and every scalable layer shares
   the StreamMuxConfig.  The mapping between each layer and its
   configuration data is achieved by LATM header information attached to
   the audio data.  In order to indicate the dependency information of
   the scalable streams, a restriction is applied to the dynamic
   assignment rule of payload type (PT) values (see section 4.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For MPEG-4 Audio coding tools, as is true for other audio coders, if
   the payload is a single audio frame, packet loss will not impair the
   decodability of adjacent packets.  Therefore, the additional media
   specific header for recovering errors will not be required for MPEG-4
   Audio.  Existing RTP protection mechanisms, such as Generic Forward
   Error Correction (RFC 2733) and Redundant Audio Data (RFC 2198), MAY
   be applied to improve error resiliency.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Conventions used in this document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [7].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  RTP Packetization of MPEG-4 Visual bitstream</h2></a>

   This section specifies RTP packetization rules for MPEG-4 Visual
   content.  An MPEG-4 Visual bitstream is mapped directly onto RTP
   packets without the addition of extra header fields or any removal of
   Visual syntax elements.  The Combined Configuration/Elementary stream
   mode MUST be used so that configuration information will be carried
   to the same RTP port as the elementary stream.  (see 6.2.1 "Start
   codes" of ISO/IEC 14496-2 [2][9][4]) The configuration information
   MAY additionally be specified by some out-of-band means.  If needed
   for an H.323 terminal, H.245 codepoint
   "decoderConfigurationInformation" MUST be used for this purpose.  If
   needed by systems using MIME content type and SDP parameters, e.g.,
   SIP and RTSP, the optional parameter "config" MUST be used to specify
   the configuration information (see 5.1 and 5.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the short video header mode is used, the RTP payload format for
   H.263 SHOULD be used (the format defined in RFC 2429 is RECOMMENDED,
   but the RFC 2190 format MAY be used for compatibility with older
   implementations).

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Use of RTP header fields for MPEG-4 Visual</h3></a>

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new
   packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will not be
   specified here.  It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular
   class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding,
   or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range SHALL
   be chosen by means of an out of band signaling protocol (e.g., H.245,
   SIP, etc).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Sequence Number: Incremented by one for each RTP data packet sent,
   starting, for security reasons, with a random initial value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Marker (M) bit: The marker bit is set to one to indicate the last RTP
   packet (or only RTP packet) of a VOP.  When multiple VOPs are carried
   in the same RTP packet, the marker bit is set to one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Timestamp: The timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the VOP
   contained in the RTP packet.  A constant offset, which is random, is
   added for security reasons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  When multiple VOPs are carried in the same RTP packet, the
      timestamp indicates the earliest of the VOP times within the VOPs
      carried in the RTP packet.  Timestamp information of the rest of
      the VOPs are derived from the timestamp fields in the VOP header
      (modulo_time_base and vop_time_increment).
   -  If the RTP packet contains only configuration information and/or
      Group_of_VideoObjectPlane() fields, the timestamp of the next VOP
      in the coding order is used.
   -  If the RTP packet contains only visual_object_sequence_end_code
      information, the timestamp of the immediately preceding VOP in the
      coding order is used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The resolution of the timestamp is set to its default value of 90kHz,
   unless specified by an out-of-band means (e.g., SDP parameter or MIME
   parameter as defined in section 5).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other header fields are used as described in RFC 1889 [8].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Fragmentation of MPEG-4 Visual bitstream</h3></a>

   A fragmented MPEG-4 Visual bitstream is mapped directly onto the RTP
   payload without any addition of extra header fields or any removal of
   Visual syntax elements.  The Combined Configuration/Elementary
   streams mode is used.  The following rules apply for the
   fragmentation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the following, header means one of the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Configuration information (Visual Object Sequence Header, Visual
      Object Header and Video Object Layer Header)
   -  visual_object_sequence_end_code
   -  The header of the entry point function for an elementary stream
      (Group_of_VideoObjectPlane() or the header of VideoObjectPlane(),
      video_plane_with_short_header(), MeshObject() or FaceObject())
   -  The video packet header (video_packet_header() excluding
      next_resync_marker())
   -  The header of gob_layer()
      See 6.2.1 "Start codes" of ISO/IEC 14496-2 [2][9][4] for the
      definition of the configuration information and the entry point
      functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (1) Configuration information and Group_of_VideoObjectPlane() fields<br>
   SHALL be placed at the beginning of the RTP payload (just after the
   RTP header) or just after the header of the syntactically upper layer
   function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (2) If one or more headers exist in the RTP payload, the RTP payload<br>
   SHALL begin with the header of the syntactically highest function.
   Note: The visual_object_sequence_end_code is regarded as the lowest
   function.
   (3) A header SHALL NOT be split into a plurality of RTP packets.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (4) Different VOPs SHOULD be fragmented into different RTP packets so<br>
   that one RTP packet consists of the data bytes associated with a
   unique VOP time instance (that is indicated in the timestamp field in
   the RTP packet header), with the exception that multiple consecutive
   VOPs MAY be carried within one RTP packet in the decoding order if
   the size of the VOPs is small.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note: When multiple VOPs are carried in one RTP payload, the
   timestamp of the VOPs after the first one may be calculated by the
   decoder.  This operation is necessary only for RTP packets in which
   the marker bit equals to one and the beginning of RTP payload
   corresponds to a start code. (See timestamp and marker bit in section
   3.1.)

   (5) It is RECOMMENDED that a single video packet is sent as a single<br>
   RTP packet.  The size of a video packet SHOULD be adjusted in such a
   way that the resulting RTP packet is not larger than the path-MTU.
   Note: Rule (5) does not apply when the video packet is disabled by<br>
   the coder configuration (by setting resync_marker_disable in the VOL
   header to 1), or in coding tools where the video packet is not
   supported.  In this case, a VOP MAY be split at arbitrary byte-
   positions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The video packet starts with the VOP header or the video packet
   header, followed by motion_shape_texture(), and ends with
   next_resync_marker() or next_start_code().

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3  Examples of packetized MPEG-4 Visual bitstream</h3></a>

   Figure 2 shows examples of RTP packets generated based on the
   criteria described in 3.2

   (a) is an example of the first RTP packet or the random access point
   of an MPEG-4 Visual bitstream containing the configuration
   information.  According to criterion (1), the Visual Object Sequence<br>
   Header(VS header) is placed at the beginning of the RTP payload,
   preceding the Visual Object Header and the Video Object Layer
   Header(VO header, VOL header).  Since the fragmentation rule defined
   in 3.2 guarantees that the configuration information, starting with
   visual_object_sequence_start_code, is always placed at the beginning
   of the RTP payload, RTP receivers can detect the random access point
   by checking if the first 32-bit field of the RTP payload is
   visual_object_sequence_start_code.
   (b) is another example of the RTP packet containing the configuration
   information.  It differs from example (a) in that the RTP packet also
   contains a video packet in the VOP following the configuration
   information.  Since the length of the configuration information is
   relatively short (typically scores of bytes) and an RTP packet
   containing only the configuration information may thus increase the
   overhead, the configuration information and the immediately following
   GOV and/or (a part of) VOP can be packetized into a single RTP packet
   as in this example.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (c) is an example of an RTP packet that contains
   Group_of_VideoObjectPlane(GOV).  Following criterion (1), the GOV is<br>
   placed at the beginning of the RTP payload.  It would be a waste of
   RTP/IP header overhead to generate an RTP packet containing only a
   GOV whose length is 7 bytes.  Therefore, (a part of) the following
   VOP can be placed in the same RTP packet as shown in (c).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (d) is an example of the case where one video packet is packetized
   into one RTP packet.  When the packet-loss rate of the underlying
   network is high, this kind of packetization is recommended.  Even
   when the RTP packet containing the VOP header is discarded by a
   packet loss, the other RTP packets can be decoded by using the
   HEC(Header Extension Code) information in the video packet header.
   No extra RTP header field is necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (e) is an example of the case where more than one video packet is
   packetized into one RTP packet.  This kind of packetization is
   effective to save the overhead of RTP/IP headers when the bit-rate of
   the underlying network is low.  However, it will decrease the
   packet-loss resiliency because multiple video packets are discarded
   by a single RTP packet loss.  The optimal number of video packets in
   an RTP packet and the length of the RTP packet can be determined
   considering the packet-loss rate and the bit-rate of the underlying
   network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (f) is an example of the case when the video packet is disabled by
   setting resync_marker_disable in the VOL header to 1.  In this case,
   a VOP may be split into a plurality of RTP packets at arbitrary
   byte-positions.  For example, it is possible to split a VOP into
   fixed-length packets.  This kind of coder configuration and RTP
   packet fragmentation may be used when the underlying network is
   guaranteed to be error-free.  On the other hand, it is not
   recommended to use it in error-prone environment since it provides
   only poor packet loss resiliency.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 3 shows examples of RTP packets prohibited by the criteria of
   3.2.
   Fragmentation of a header into multiple RTP packets, as in (a), will
   not only increase the overhead of RTP/IP headers but also decrease
   the error resiliency.  Therefore, it is prohibited by the criterion
   (3).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When concatenating more than one video packets into an RTP packet,
   VOP header or video_packet_header() shall not be placed in the middle
   of the RTP payload.  The packetization as in (b) is not allowed by
   criterion (2) due to the aspect of the error resiliency.  Comparing<br>
   this example with Figure 2(d), although two video packets are mapped
   onto two RTP packets in both cases, the packet-loss resiliency is not
   identical.  Namely, if the second RTP packet is lost, both video
   packets 1 and 2 are lost in the case of Figure 3(b) whereas only
   video packet 2 is lost in the case of Figure 2(d).

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.  RTP Packetization of MPEG-4 Audio bitstream</h2></a>

   This section specifies RTP packetization rules for MPEG-4 Audio
   bitstreams.  MPEG-4 Audio streams MUST be formatted by LATM (Low-
   overhead MPEG-4 Audio Transport Multiplex) tool [5], and the LATM-
   based streams are then mapped onto RTP packets as described the three
   sections below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1  RTP Packet Format</h3></a>

   LATM-based streams consist of a sequence of audioMuxElements that
   include one or more audio frames.  A complete audioMuxElement or a
   part of one SHALL be mapped directly onto an RTP payload without any
   removal of audioMuxElement syntax elements (see Figure 4).  The first
   byte of each audioMuxElement SHALL be located at the first payload
   location in an RTP packet.

   In order to decode the audioMuxElement, the following
   muxConfigPresent information is required to be indicated by an out-
   of-band means.  When SDP is utilized for this indication, MIME
   parameter "cpresent" corresponds to the muxConfigPresent information
   (see section 5.3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   muxConfigPresent: If this value is set to 1 (in-band mode), the
   audioMuxElement SHALL include an indication bit "useSameStreamMux"
   and MAY include the configuration information for audio compression
   "StreamMuxConfig".  The useSameStreamMux bit indicates whether the
   StreamMuxConfig element in the previous frame is applied in the
   current frame.  If the useSameStreamMux bit indicates to use the
   StreamMuxConfig from the previous frame, but if the previous frame
   has been lost, the current frame may not be decodable.  Therefore, in
   case of in-band mode, the StreamMuxConfig element SHOULD be
   transmitted repeatedly depending on the network condition.  On the
   other hand, if muxConfigPresent is set to 0 (out-band mode), the
   StreamMuxConfig element is required to be transmitted by an out-of-
   band means.  In case of SDP, MIME parameter "config" is utilized (see
   section 5.3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2  Use of RTP Header Fields for MPEG-4 Audio</h3></a>

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new
   packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will not be
   specified here.  It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular
   class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding,
   or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall
   be chosen by means of an out of band signaling protocol (e.g., H.245,
   SIP, etc).  In the dynamic assignment of RTP payload types for
   scalable streams, a different value SHOULD be assigned to each layer.
   The assigned values SHOULD be in order of enhance layer dependency,
   where the base layer has the smallest value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Marker (M) bit: The marker bit indicates audioMuxElement boundaries.
   It is set to one to indicate that the RTP packet contains a complete
   audioMuxElement or the last fragment of an audioMuxElement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Timestamp: The timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the first
   audio frame contained in the RTP packet.  Timestamps are recommended
   to start at a random value for security reasons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unless specified by an out-of-band means, the resolution of the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3  Fragmentation of MPEG-4 Audio bitstream</h3></a>

   It is RECOMMENDED to put one audioMuxElement in each RTP packet.  If
   the size of an audioMuxElement can be kept small enough that the size
   of the RTP packet containing it does not exceed the size of the
   path-MTU, this will be no problem.  If it cannot, the audioMuxElement
   MAY be fragmented and spread across multiple packets.

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [8].  This implies that confidentiality of the media
   streams is achieved by encryption.  Because the data compression used
   with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be
   performed on the compressed data so there is no conflict between the
   two operations.
   The complete MPEG-4 system allows for transport of a wide range of
   content, including Java applets (MPEG-J) and scripts.  Since this
   payload format is restricted to audio and video streams, it is not
   possible to transport such active content in this format.
