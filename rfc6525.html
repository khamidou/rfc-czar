   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Stream Reconfiguration

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   (SCTP) want the ability to "reset" a stream.  The intention of
   resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream
   back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application
   layer that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this
   feature want it so that they can "reuse" streams for different
   purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the
   application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature,
   a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater
   than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to "reset the
   streams back to zero".  This document also includes methods for
   resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional
   streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Many applications that use SCTP as defined in [RFC4960] want the
   ability to "reset" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is
   to set the Stream Sequence Numbers (SSNs) of the stream back to
   'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer
   that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this
   feature want to "reuse" streams for different purposes but still
   utilize the SSN so that the application can track the message flows.
   Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result
   in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol
   mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero".  This document also
   includes methods for resetting the Transmission Sequence Numbers
   (TSNs), adding additional streams, and resetting all SSNs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The sockets API for SCTP defined in [RFC6458] exposes the sequence
   numbers used by SCTP for user message transfer.  Therefore, resetting
   them can be used by application writers.  Please note that the
   corresponding sequence number for TCP is not exposed via the sockets
   API for TCP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   New Chunk Type</h2></a>

   This section defines the new chunk type that will be used to
   reconfigure streams.  Table 1 illustrates the new chunk type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><pre>            +------------+------------------------------------+
            | Chunk Type | Chunk Name                         |

            | 130        | Re-configuration Chunk (RE-CONFIG) |
            +------------+------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   It should be noted that the format of the RE-CONFIG chunk requires
   that the receiver ignore the chunk if it is not understood and
   continue processing all chunks that follow.  This is accomplished by
   the use of the upper bits of the chunk type as described in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC4960].

   This document adds one new chunk type to SCTP.  The chunk has the

   This section defines the procedures used by both the sender and
   receiver of a RE-CONFIG chunk.  Various examples of re-configuration
   scenarios are given in Appendix A.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One important thing to remember about SCTP streams is that they are
   uni-directional and there is no correspondence between outgoing and
   incoming streams.  The procedures outlined in this section are
   designed so that the incoming side will always reset its SSN first
   (before the outgoing side), which means the re-configuration request
   must always originate from the outgoing side.  These two issues have
   important ramifications upon how an SCTP endpoint might request that
   its incoming streams be reset.  In effect, it must ask the peer to
   start an outgoing reset procedure and once that request is
   acknowledged let the peer actually control the reset operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Sender-Side Procedures</h3></a>

   This section describes the procedures related to the sending of
   RE-CONFIG chunks.  A RE-CONFIG chunk is composed of one or two Type-
   Length-Value (TLV) parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1   Sender-Side Procedures for the RE-CONFIG Chunk</h4></a>

   The SCTP protocol extension described in this document uses the
   Supported Extensions Parameter defined in [RFC5061] for negotiating
   the support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An SCTP endpoint supporting this extension MUST include the chunk
   type of the RE-CONFIG chunk in the Supported Extensions Parameter in
   either the INIT or INIT-ACK.  Before sending a RE-CONFIG chunk, the
   sender MUST ensure that the peer advertised support for the
   re-configuration extension.  If the chunk type of the RE-CONFIG chunk
   does not appear in the supported extension's list of chunks, then the
   sender MUST NOT send any re-configuration request to the peer, and
   any request by the application for such service SHOULD be responded
   to with an appropriate error indicating that the peer SCTP stack does
   not support the re-configuration extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At any given time, there MUST NOT be more than one request in flight.
   So, if the Re-configuration Timer is running and the RE-CONFIG chunk
   contains at least one request parameter, the chunk MUST be buffered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After packaging the RE-CONFIG chunk and sending it to the peer, the
   sender MUST start the Re-configuration Timer if the RE-CONFIG chunk
   contains at least one request parameter.  If it contains no request
   parameters, the Re-configuration Timer MUST NOT be started.  This
   timer MUST use the same value as SCTP's data transmission timer
   (i.e., the retransmission timeout (RTO) timer) and MUST use
   exponential backoff, doubling the value at every expiration.  If the
   timer expires, besides doubling the value, the sender MUST retransmit
   the RE-CONFIG chunk, increment the appropriate error counts (for both
   the association and the destination), and perform threshold
   management, possibly destroying the association if SCTP
   retransmission thresholds are exceeded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A1:  The sender MUST stop assigning new SSNs to new user data

Appendix A.  Examples of the Reconfiguration Procedures

   Please note that this appendix is informational only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following message flows between Endpoints E-A and E-Z illustrate
   the described procedures.  The time progresses in downward direction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following example illustrates E-A resetting streams 1 and 2 for
   just its outgoing streams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      E-A                                         E-Z

      <-------------[RE-CONFIG(RESP:X)]--------------

   The following example illustrates E-A resetting streams 1 and 2 for
   just its incoming streams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      E-A                                         E-Z

      <--------[RE-CONFIG(OUT-REQ:Y,X/1,2)]----------

   The following example illustrates E-A resetting all streams in both
   directions.

   The following example illustrates E-A requesting that the streams and
   TSNs be reset.  At completion, E-A has the new sending TSN (selected
   by the peer) of B, and E-Z has the new sending TSN of A (also
   selected by the peer).

      <-----[RE-CONFIG(RESP:X/S-TSN=A, R-TSN=B)]-----

   The following example illustrates E-A requesting the addition of 3
   outgoing streams.
