	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Objective</h3></a>

   The objective of this document is to establish a terminology
   framework and to provide the operational requirements, which can be
   used by different Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authorities who are
   considering establishing trust relationships with each other.  The
   document defines different types of possible trust relationships,
   identifies design and implementation considerations that PKIs should
   implement to facilitate trust relationships across PKIs, and
   identifies issues that should be considered when implementing trust
   relationships.  This document defines terminology and
   interoperability requirements for multi-domain PKIs from one
   perspective.  A PKI domain can achieve multi-domain PKI
   interoperability by complying with the requirements in this document.
   However, there are other ways to define and realize multi-domain PKI
   interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Document Outline</h3></a>

   Section 2 introduces the PKI basics, which provide a background for
   multi-domain PKI.  Section 3 provides the definitions and
   requirements of 'PKI domain' and describes the typical models of
   multi-domain PKI.  Section 4 considers the Trust List Models
   depending on relying party-CA relationships (not CA-CA trust
   relationships, as they are not a focus of this document).  Section 5
   identifies abbreviations used in the document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Basics</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Basic Terms</h3></a>

   The following terms are used throughout this document.  Where
   possible, definitions found in RFC 4949 [RFC4949] have been used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Certificate:  A digitally signed data structure that attests to the
      binding of a system entity's identity to a public key value (based
      on the definition of public key certificate in RFC 4949
      [RFC4949]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Certificate Policy:  A named set of rules that indicates the
      applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or
      class of application with common security requirements (X.509
      [CCITT.X509.2000]).  Note that to avoid confusion, this document
      uses the terminology "Certificate Policy Document" to refer to the
      document that defines the rules and "Policy Object Identifier
      (OID)" to specify a particular rule set.
   Certificate Policy Document:  A document that defines the rules for
      the issuance and management of certificates and identifies Policy
      Object Identifiers (OIDs) for these rules.  A Certificate Policy
      Document may define more than one Policy OID.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Policy Object Identifier (Policy OID):  An identifier applied to a
      set of rules governing the issuance and management of
      certificates.  Policy OIDs are defined in the Certificate Policy
      Documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Certification Authority (CA):  An entity that issues certificates
      (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the binding
      between the data items in a certificate (RFC 4949 [RFC4949]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   End Entity (EE):  A system entity that is the subject of a
      certificate and that is using, or is permitted and able to use,
      the matching private key only for a purpose or purposes other than
      signing a certificate; i.e., an entity that is not a CA (RFC 4949

      certificate user).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Relationships between Certification Authorities</h3></a>

   CAs establish trust relationships by issuing certificates to other
   CAs.  CA relationships are divided into 'certification hierarchy'
   [RFC4949] and 'cross-certification' [RFC4949].

                  Figure 1: Hierarchical CA Relationship

   There are two types of hierarchical relationships, depending on
   whether a subordinate CA certificate or a unilateral cross-
   certificate is used.  In the case where one (superior) CA issues a
   subordinate CA certificate to another, the CA at the top of the
   hierarchy, which must itself have a self-signed certificate, is
   called a root CA.  In the case where one CA issues unilateral cross-
   certificates to other CAs, the CA issuing unilateral cross-
   certificates is called a Unifying CA.  Unifying CAs use only
   unilateral cross-certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE: In this document, the definition of root CA is according to the
   second definition (context for hierarchical PKI) of 'root CA' in RFC
   4949 [RFC4949].  This document uses the terminology 'trust anchor CA'
   for the first definition (context for PKI) of 'root CA' in RFC 4949.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Root CA:  A CA that is at the top of a hierarchy, and itself should
      not issue certificates to end entities (except those required for
      its own operation) but issues subordinate CA certificates to one
      or more CAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subordinate CA:  A CA whose public key certificate is issued by
      another superior CA, and itself must not be used as a trust anchor
      CA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unifying CA:  A CA that is at the top of a hierarchy, and itself
      should not issue certificates to end entities (except those
      required for its own operation) but establishes unilateral cross-
      certification with other CAs.  A Unifying CA must permit CAs to
      which it issues cross-certificates to have self-signed
      certificates.
	<a name="section-2.2.2"><h4>2.2.2   Peer-to-Peer CA Relationships</h4></a>

   In a peer relationship, no parent-child relationship is created.  To
   establish peer relationships, only cross-certificates are used.  Peer
   relationships can be either unilateral or bilateral, as shown in
   Figure 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                                              Bilateral
                    Unilateral           Cross-Certification

                  Figure 2: Peer-to-Peer CA Relationships

   In the case where a CA exists only to manage cross-certificates, that
   CA is called a Bridge CA.  CAs can establish unilateral or bilateral
   cross-certification with a Bridge CA, as shown in Figure 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bridge CA:  A CA that, itself, does not issue certificates to end
      entities (except those required for its own operation) but

	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Architectures</h3></a>

   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):  A system of CAs that perform some
      set of certificate management, archive management, key management,
      and token management functions for a community of users in an
      application of asymmetric cryptography and share trust
      relationships, operate under the same Certificate Policy Document
      specifying a shared set of Policy OID(s), and are either operated
      by a single organization or under the direction of a single
      organization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, a PKI that intends to enter into trust relationships
   with other PKIs must designate a Principal CA (PCA) that will manage
   all trust relationships.  This Principal CA should also be the trust
   anchor CA for relying parties of that PKI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Principal CA (PCA):  A CA that should have a self-signed certificate
      is designated as the CA that will issue cross-certificates to
      Principal CAs in other PKIs, and may be the subject of cross-
      certificates issued by Principal CAs in other PKIs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In discussing different possible architectures for PKI, the concept
   of a certification path is necessary.  A certification path is built
   based on trust relationships between CAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Certification Path:  An ordered sequence of certificates where the
      subject of each certificate in the path is the issuer of the next

   Definition:  A mesh PKI consists of multiple CAs with self-signed
      certificates that issue certificates to EEs and issue cross-
      certificates to each other.  A mesh PKI may be a full mesh, where
      all CAs issue cross-certificates to all other CAs, as shown in
      Figure 6.  A mesh PKI may also be a partial mesh, where all CAs do
      not issue cross-certificates to all other CAs.  In a partial mesh
      PKI, certification paths may not exist from all CAs to all other
      CAs, as shown in Figure 7.

   Trust anchor CA:  The trust anchor CA for an end entity is usually
      the CA that issued the end entity's certificate.  The trust anchor
      CA for an end entity that is not issued a certificate from the
      mesh PKI may be any CA in the PKI.  In a partial mesh, selection
      of the trust anchor may result in no certification path from the
      trust anchor to one or more CAs in the mesh.  For example, in
      Figure 7 above, the selection of CA1 or CA2 as the trust anchor CA
      will result in paths from all end entities in the figure.
      However, the selection of CA3 as the trust anchor CA will result
      in certification paths only for those EEs whose certificates were
      issued by CA3.  No certification path exists to CA1 or CA2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Principal CA:  The Principal CA may be any CA within the mesh PKI.

   Trust anchor CA:  The trust anchor CA for a hybrid PKI may be any CA
      with self-issued certificates in the hybrid PKI.  However, because
      of the potential complexity of a hybrid PKI, the PKI should
      provide guidance regarding the selection of the trust anchor to
      relying parties because a relying party may fail to build an
      appropriate certification path to a subscriber if they choose an
      inappropriate trust anchor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Principal CA:  The Principal CA may be any CA within the hybrid PKI
      and should have a self-signed certificate for cross-certification
      with other PKI domains.  However, the hybrid PKI must have only
      one Principal CA and a certification path must exist from the
      Principal CA to every CA within the PKI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Considerations:  This model should be used sparingly because of the
      complexity of determining trust anchors and building certification
      paths.  However, hybrid PKIs may occur as a result of the

      joining together to become a single PKI.
	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Relationships between PKIs and Relying Parties</h3></a>

   Relying Parties establish trust relationships by trust anchor to a
   PKI.  Relying Parties may use a Trust List for establishing trust
   relationships to one or more PKIs.  A Trust List is a set of one or
   more trust anchors for trusting one or more PKIs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two types of maintenance models of Trust List, Local Trust
   List Model and Trust Authority Model.  The two models are described

   Two or more PKIs may choose to enter into trust relationships with
   each other.  For these relationships, each PKI retains its own set of
   Certificate Policy OIDs and its own Principal CA.  In addition to
   making a business decision to consider a trust relationship, each PKI
   determines the level of trust of each external PKI by reviewing
   external PKI Certificate Policy Document(s) and any other PKI
   governance documentation through a process known as policy mapping.
   Trust relationships are technically formalized through the issuance
   of cross-certificates.  Such a collection of two or more PKIs is
   known as a PKI domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKI domain:  A set of two or more PKIs that have chosen to enter into

   A cross-certificate from the Principal CA of one PKI to the Principal
   CA of another PKI indicates a mapping between one or more policies of
   the first PKI and one or more policies of the second PKI.  When a

              Figure 9: Participation in Multiple PKI Domains

   As shown in Figure 9, PKI2 is a member of both PKI domain 1 and PKI
   domain 2.  Since a certification path exists from PKI1 to PKI2, and
   from PKI2 to PKI3, a certification path also exists from PKI1 to
   PKI3.  However, PKI1 does not share domain membership with PKI3, so
   the certification path validation from PKI1 to PKI3 with a validation
   policy for PKI domain 1 must not succeed.  To ensure correct
   certification path validation and policy mapping, the cross-
   certificates issued by both PKI1 and PKI3 to PKI2 must contain
   constraints such as policy mapping or name constraints disallowing
   the validation of certification paths outside their respective
   domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To fully prevent inadvertent trust, any PKI that is a member of one
   or more PKI domains must inform all those PKI domains of its
   membership in all other PKI domains.  In addition, that PKI must
   inform all those PKI domains of which it is a member, any time its
   membership status changes with regards to any other PKI domain.  If a
   PKI domain is informed of the change in status of one of its member
   PKIs with regards to other PKI domains, that PKI domain must review
   the constraints in any cross-certificate issued to that PKI.  If the
   change in membership would result in a change to the allowed or
   disallowed certification paths, the PKI domain must ensure that all
   such cross-certificates are revoked and re-issued with correct
   constraints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.4"><h4>3.2.4   Considerations for PKIs and PKI Domains with Multiple Policies</h4></a>

   In some cases, a single PKI may issue certificates at more than one
   assurance level.  If so, the Certificate Policy Document must define
   separate Policy OIDs for each assurance level, and must define the
   differences between certificates of different assurance levels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PKI domain may also support more than one assurance level.  If so,

   level, may have a one-to-one relationship between PKI assurance
   levels and PKI domain assurance levels, or may have many-to-one or
   one-to-many relationships between assurance levels.  These
   relationships must be defined in cross-certificates issued between
   PKIs in the PKI domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   PKI Domain Models</h3></a>

   Two or more PKI domains may choose to enter into trust relationships

   establishing a new Unifying or Bridge CA or by issuing cross-
   certificates between their Principal CAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1   Unifying Trust Point (Unifying Domain) Model</h4></a>

   In the Unifying Trust Point Model, a PKI domain is created by
   establishing a joint, superior CA that issues unilateral cross-
   certificates to each PKI domain, as shown in Figure 10.  Such a
   joint, superior CA is defined as a Unifying CA, and the Principal CAs
   in each PKI domain have the hierarchical CA relationship with that
   Unifying CA.  In this model, any relying party from any of the PKI
   domains must specify the Unifying CA as its trust anchor CA in order

   In Independent Trust Point Models, relying parties continue to use
   only the trust anchor of their PKI domain.  A relying party in the
   individual trust point model can continue to use the trust anchor of
   its PKI domain.

   In this model, each PKI domain trusts each other by issuing a cross-
   certificate directly between each Principal CA, as shown in
   Figure 11.  This model may be used for shortening a certification
   path or establishing a trust relationship expeditiously.

      account that the other PKI domain may cross-certify with any other

      path, the PKI domain should not rely on the validation policy of
      the relying party, but should include the constraints in the
      cross-certificate explicitly.  A PKI domain that relies on the
      validation policy of the relying party about such constraints
      cannot guarantee that the constraints will be recognized and

<a name="section-3.3.2.2"><h4>3.3.2.2   Bridge Model</h4></a>
                        <a href="raw/text/rfc5217.txt" class="rawLink">raw</a>
                    

   In this model, every PKI domain trusts each other through a Bridge CA
   by cross-certification, as shown in Figure 12.  The trust
   relationship is not established between a subscriber domain and a
   relying party domain directly, but established from the Principal CA
   of the relying party's PKI domain via a Bridge CA.  This model is
   useful in reducing the number of cross-certifications required for a
   PKI domain to interoperate with other PKI domains.
   Requirements for Bridge model:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Bridge CA must not be used as the trust anchor CA in any PKI
      domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Bridge CA should issue cross-certificates with other PKI
      domains mutually or may issue cross-certificates unilaterally.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Bridge CA must not issue End Entity (EE) certificates except
      when it is necessary for the CA's operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Bridge CA must use its own domain Policy OID, not other PKI
      domain Policy OID(s), for the policy mapping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Bridge CA should be a neutral position to all PKI domains,
      which trust through the Bridge CA.  For example, in Figure 12, in
      the case that a relying party who trusts the PCA of PKI domain 1
      as its trust anchor CA builds the certification path to a
      subscriber in PKI domain 3:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Cross-Certificate from PKI domain 1 to the Bridge CA:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            issuerDomainPolicy ::= domain Policy OID of PKI domain 1

            subjectDomainPolicy := domain Policy OID of the Bridge CA

         Cross-Certificate from the Bridge CA to PKI domain 3:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            issuerDomainPolicy ::= domain Policy OID of the Bridge CA

            subjectDomainPolicy ::= domain Policy OID of PKI domain 3

   o  Cross-certificates issued by the Bridge CA and cross-certificate
      issued to the Bridge CA should include the requireExplicitPolicy
      with a value that is greater than zero in the policyConstraints
      extension because a relying party may not set the initial-
      explicit-policy to TRUE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  PKI domains cross-certified with the Bridge CA should not cross-
      certify directly to other PKI domains cross-certified with the
      same Bridge CA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The Bridge CA should clarify the method for the policy mapping of
      cross-certification to keep its transparency.
   Considerations:  The Bridge CA should be operated by an independent
      third party agreed upon by the PKI domains or a consortium
      consisting of representatives from the PKI domain members.  The
      Bridge CA should do policy mapping in a well-documented and
      agreed-upon manner with all PKI domains.  When applying the name
      constraints, the Bridge CA needs to avoid creating conflicts
      between the name spaces of the cross-certified PKI domains.  The
      PKI domains that perform cross-certification with the Bridge CA
      should confirm the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Does the Bridge CA perform the policy mapping via its own
         domain Policy OID?

      *  Does the Bridge CA clarify the method of policy mapping in the
         cross-certification?

      *  Is the Bridge CA able to accept the domain policy that the PKI
         domain desires?

         +  If the domain policy is mapped to one with a lower security
            level, the PKI domain should not accept it.  Otherwise, the
            PKI domain must carefully consider the risks involved with
            accepting certificates with a lower security level.

   Each PKI domain may use policy mapping for crossing different PKI

              Figure 13: Relying Party Local Trust List Model

   Creating a Local Trust List is the simplest method for relying
   parties to trust EE certificates.  Using Local Trust Lists does not
   require cross-certification between the PKI that issued the relying
   party's own certificate and the PKI that issued the EE's
   certificate,nor does it require implementing mechanisms for
   processing complex certification paths, as all CAs in a path can be
   included in the Local Trust List.  As a result, Local Trust Lists are
   the most common model in use today.  However, because Local Trust
   Lists are created and managed independently by each relying party,
   the use of Local Trust Lists can be difficult for an enterprise to
   manage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.2"><h4>4.1.2   Trust Authority Model</h4></a>

   A Trust Authority may be operated by a PKI, a collection of relying
   parties that share a common set of users, an enterprise on behalf of
   all of its relying parties, or an independent entity.  Although PKIs
   generally establish trust relationships through cross-certificates, a
   PKI may choose to provide a Trust Authority to support relying
   parties that do not support processing of certification paths.  A
   collection of relying parties that share a common set of users may

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This section highlights security considerations related to
   establishing PKI domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   PKI Domain Models</h3></a>

   For all PKI domain models described in Section 3.3 created through
   the issuance of cross-certificates, standard threats including
   message insertion, modification, and man-in-the-middle are not
   applicable because all information created by CAs, including policy
   mapping and constraints, is digitally signed by the CA generating the
   cross-certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Verifying that a given certificate was issued by a member of a PKI
   domain may be a time-critical determination.  If cross-certificates
   and revocation status information cannot be obtained in a timely
   manner, a denial of service may be experienced by the end entity.  In
   situations where such verification is critical, caching of cross-
   certificates and revocation status information may be warranted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An additional security consideration for PKI domains is creating
   inadvertent trust relationships, which can occur if a single PKI is a
   member of multiple PKI domains.  See Section 3.2.3 for a discussion
   of creating inadvertent trust relationships and mechanisms to prevent
   it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, members of PKI domains must participate in domain
   governance, or at a minimum, be informed anytime a PKI joins or
   leaves the domain, so that domain members can make appropriate
   decisions for maintaining their own membership in the domain or
   choosing to restrict or deny trust in the new member PKI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Trust List Models</h3></a>

   In these models, many standard attacks are not applicable since
   certificates are digitally signed.  Additional security
   considerations apply when trust is created through a Trust List.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A variation of the modification attack is possible in Trust List
   Models.  If an attacker is able to add or remove CAs from the relying
   party or Trust Authority Trust List, the attacker can affect which
   certificates will or will not be accepted.  To prevent this attack,
   access to Trust Lists must be adequately protected against
   unauthorized modification.  This protection is especially important
   for trust anchors that are used by multiple applications, as it is a
   key vulnerability of this model.  This attack may result in
   unauthorized usage if a CA is added to a Trust List, or denial of
   service if a CA is removed from a Trust List.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For Trust Authority models, a denial-of-service attack is also
   possible if the application cannot obtain timely information from the
   trust anchor.  Applications should specify service-level agreements
   with Trust Authority.  In addition, applications may choose to
   locally cache the list of CAs maintained by the Trust Authority as a
   backup in the event that the trust anchor's repository (e.g.,
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory) is not
   available.
