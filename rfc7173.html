   The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol
   [RFC6325] provides optimal pair-wise data frame routing without
   configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology.  TRILL
   supports multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.  Devices
   that implement TRILL are called TRILL switches or Routing Bridges
   (RBridges).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Links between TRILL switches can be based on arbitrary link
   protocols, for example, PPP [RFC6361], as well as Ethernet [RFC6325].
   A set of connected TRILL switches together form a TRILL campus that
   is bounded by end stations and Layer 3 routers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies how to interconnect a pair of TRILL switch
   ports using a pseudowire under existing TRILL and PWE3 (Pseudowire
   Emulation End-to-End) standards.

	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   PWE3 Interconnection of TRILL Switches</h2></a>

   When a pseudowire is used to interconnect a pair of TRILL switch
   ports, a PPP [RFC4618] pseudowire is used as described below.  The
   pseudowire between such ports can be signaled [RFC4447] or manually
   configured.  In this context, the TRILL switch ports at the ends of
   the pseudowire are acting as native service processing (NSP) elements
   [RFC3985] and, assuming that the pseudowires are over MPLS or IP
   [RFC4023] networks, as label switched or IP routers at the TRILL
   switch ports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pseudowires provide transparent transport, and the two TRILL switch
   ports appear directly interconnected with a transparent link.  With
   such an interconnection, the TRILL adjacency over the link is
   automatically discovered and established through TRILL IS-IS control
   messages [RFC7177].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A pseudowire is carried over a packet switched network tunnel
   [RFC3985], for example, an MPLS or MPLS-TP label switched path tunnel
   in MPLS networks.  Either a signaling protocol or manual
   configuration can be used to configure a label switched path tunnel
   between two TRILL switch ports.  This application needs no additions
   to the existing pseudowire standards.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   PWE3 Type-Independent Details</h3></a>

   The sending pseudowire TRILL switch port SHOULD map the inner
   priority of the TRILL Data packets being sent to the Traffic Class
   field of the pseudowire label [RFC5462] so as to minimize the
   probability that higher priority TRILL Data packets will be discarded
   due to excessive TRILL Data packets of lower priority.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   TRILL IS-IS PDUs critical to establishing and maintaining adjacency
   (Hello and MTU PDUs) SHOULD be sent with the MPLS Traffic Class that
   calls for handling with the maximum priority.  Other TRILL IS-IS PDUs
   SHOULD be sent with the MPLS Traffic Class denoting the highest
   priority that is less than the maximum priority.  TRILL Data packets
   SHOULD be sent with appropriate MPLS Traffic Classes, typically
   mapped from the TRILL Data packet priority, such that TRILL Data
   packet Traffic Classes denote priorities less than the priorities
   used for TRILL IS-IS PDUs.  This minimizes the probability of other
   traffic interfering with these important control PDUs and causing
   false loss of adjacency or other control problems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a pseudowire supports fragmentation and reassembly (a feature that
   has received little or no deployment), then there is no reason to do
   TRILL MTU testing on it, and the pseudowire will not be a constraint
   on the TRILL campus-wide MTU size (Sz) (see Section 4.3.1 of
   [RFC6325]).  If the pseudowire does not support fragmentation (the
   more common case), then the available TRILL IS-IS packet payload size
   over the pseudowire (taking into account MPLS encapsulation with a
   control word) or some lower value, MUST be used in helping to
   determine MTU size (Sz) (see Section 5 of [RFC7180]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An intervening MPLS label switched router or similar packet switched
   network device has no awareness of TRILL.  Such devices will not
   change the TRILL Header hop count.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   PPP PWE3 Transport of TRILL</h3></a>

   For a PPP pseudowire (PW type = 0x0007), the two TRILL switch ports
   being connected are configured to form a pseudowire with PPP
   encapsulation [RFC4618].  After the pseudowire is established and
   TRILL use is negotiated within PPP, the two TRILL switch ports appear
   directly connected with a PPP link [RFC1661] [RFC6361].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If pseudowire interconnection of two TRILL switch ports is signaled
   [RFC4447], the initiating TRILL switch port MUST attempt the
   connection setup with pseudowire type PPP (0x0007).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Behavior for TRILL with a PPP pseudowire continues to follow that of
   TRILL over PPP as specified in Section 3 of [RFC6361].
   The following figures show what a TRILL Data packet and TRILL IS-IS
   packet look like over such a pseudowire in the MPLS case, assuming no
   TRILL Header extensions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   TRILL-level security mechanisms, such as the ability to use
   authentication with TRILL IS-IS PDUs [RFC6325], are not affected by
   link technology, such as the use of pseudowire links as specified in
   this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Link security may be useful in improving TRILL campus security.
   TRILL is transported over pseudowires as TRILL over PPP over
   pseudowires, pseudowires are over MPLS or IP, and MPLS and IP are
   over some lower-level link technology.  Thus, link security below the
   TRILL level for a pseudowire link could be provided by PPP security,
   pseudowire security, MPLS or IP security, or security of the link
   technology supporting MPLS or IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PPP TRILL security considerations are discussed in [RFC6361].  For
   security considerations introduced by carrying PPP TRILL links over
   pseudowires, see [RFC3985], which discusses the risks introduced by
   sending protocols that previously assumed a point-to-point link on a
   pseudowire built on a packet switched network (PSN).  However, the
   PPP layer in TRILL transport by pseudowire is somewhat vestigial and
   intended primarily as a convenient way to use existing PPP code
   points to identify TRILL Data packets and TRILL IS-IS packets.
   Furthermore, existing PPP security standards are arguably
   questionable in terms of current security criteria.  For these
   reasons, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use PPP security in the transport
   of TRILL by pseudowires as specified in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that link security be provided at the layers
   supporting pseudowires transporting TRILL, that is, at the MPLS or IP
   layer or the link layer transporting MPLS or IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For applications involving sensitive data, end-to-end security should
   always be considered, in addition to link security, to provide
   security in depth.  In this context, such end-to-end security should
   be between the end stations involved so as to protect the entire path
   to, through, and from the TRILL campus.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [RFC6325].
Appendix A.  Use of Other Pseudowire Types

   This informational appendix briefly discusses the use of pseudowire
   types other than PPP for the transport of TRILL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of Ethernet pseudowires [RFC4448] was examined by the authors
   and would be possible without change to such pseudowires; however,
   this would require an additional 12 or 16 bytes per packet within the
   payload being transmitted over the pseudowire for a TRILL Data packet
   (Figure 3) and a TRILL IS-IS packet (Figure 4) over such an Ethernet
   pseudowire in the MPLS case, assuming no TRILL Header extensions
   (compare with Figures 1 and 2):

   It would also be possible to specify a new pseudowire type for TRILL
   traffic, but the authors feel that any efficiency gain over PPP
   pseudowires would be too small to be worth the complexity of adding
   such a specification.  Furthermore, using PPP pseudowire encoding
   means that any traffic dissector that understands TRILL PPP encoding
   [RFC6361] and PPP pseudowires [RFC4618] will automatically be able to
   recursively decode TRILL transported by pseudowire.
