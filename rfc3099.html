The definition of a secured zone is presented, clarifying and updating

secured with DSA keys.  This document changes this to define a zone to
be secured or not secured regardless of the key algorithm used (or not
used).  To further simplify the determination of a zone's status,
"experimentally secure" status is deprecated.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-based
(Simple Network Management Protocol) management of the Baseline Privacy
Interface (BPI), which provides data privacy for DOCSIS 1.0 (Data-Over-

                                        for SLP

The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides mechanisms whereby service
agent clients can advertise and user agent clients can query for
services.  The design is very much demand-driven, so that user agents
only obtain service information when they specifically ask for it.
There exists another class of user agent applications, however, that
requires notification when a new service appears or disappears. In the
RFC 2608 design, these applications are forced to poll the network to
catch changes.  In this document, we describe a protocol for allowing
such clients to be notified when a change occurs, removing the need for
polling.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
community.

	<a name="section-3010"><h2>3010.     Shepler         Dec 2000        NFS version 4 Protocol</h2></a>

NFS (Network File System) version 4 is a distributed file system
protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol versions 2 [RFC1094] and 3
[RFC1813].  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports
traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and
the mount protocol.  In addition, support for strong security (and its
negotiation), compound operations, client caching, and
internationalization have been added.  Of course, attention has been
applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.

	<a name="section-3009"><h2>3009.     Rosenberg       Nov 2000        Registration of parityfec MIME</h2></a>
                                        types

The RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) payload format for generic
forward error correction allows RTP participants to improve loss
resiliency through the use of traditional parity-based channel codes.
This payload format requires four new MIME types, audio/parityfec,
video/parityfec, text/parityfec and application/parityfec.  This
document serves as the MIME type registration for those formats.

This document proposes a revised model of Domain Name System Security
(DNSSEC) Signing Authority.  The revised model is designed to clarify
earlier documents and add additional restrictions to simplify the secure
resolution process.  Specifically, this affects the authorization of
keys to sign sets of records.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

routers about the compressibility they may obtain.  [STANDARDS TRACK]
	<a name="section-3005"><h2>3005.     Harris          Nov 2000        IETF Discussion List Charter</h2></a>

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
furthers the development and specification of Internet technology
through discussion of technical issues, and hosts discussions of IETF
direction, policy, meetings, and procedures.  As this is the most
general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.
Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote employment
opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as do
discussions of a personal nature.  This document specifies an Internet
Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
discussion and suggestions for improvements.

	<a name="section-3004"><h2>3004.     Stump           Nov 2000        The User Class Option for DHCP</h2></a>

This option is used by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
client to optionally identify the type or category of user or
applications it represents.  The information contained in this option is
an opaque field that represents the user class of which the client is a
member.  Based on this class, a DHCP server selects the appropriate
address pool to assign an address to the client and the appropriate
configuration parameters.  This option should be configurable by a user.

The audio layers of the MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 standards are in frequent use
on the internet, but there is no uniform Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extension (MIME) type for these files.  The intention of this document
is to define the media type audio/mpeg to refer to this kind of
