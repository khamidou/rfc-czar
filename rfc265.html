I. INTRODUCTION

    The file transfer protocol (FTP) is a userlevel procotocol for
file transfer between host computers (including terminal IMPs), on the
ARPA computer network (ARPANET). The primary function of FTP is to
facilitate transfer of files between hosts and to allow convenient use
of storage and file handling capabilities of remote hosts. FTP uses
the Data Transfer Protocol described in RFC 264 to achieve transfer of
data. This paper assumes knowledge of RFC 264.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    The objectives of FTP are to promote sharing of files (computer
programs and/or data) encourage implicit (without explicit login) use
of computers, and shield the user from variations in file and storage
systems of different hosts. These objetives are achieved by specifying
a standard file transfer socket and initial connection protocol for
implicit use, and using standard conventions for file transfer and
related operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">II. DISCUSSION

    A file is considered here to be an ordered set of arbitrary
length, consisting of computer data (including programs). Files are
uniquely identified in a system by their pathnames. A pathname is
(loosely) defined to be the data string which must be input to the
file system by a network user in order to identify a file. Pathname
usually contains device and/or directory names, and file name. FTP
specifications provide standard file system commands, but do not
provide standard naming convention at this time. Each user must follow
the naming convention of the file system be wishing to use. FTP may be
extended later to include standard conventions of pathname structures.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    A file may or may not have access control associated with it The
access controls designate users access privileges. In absence of
access controls, files cannot be protected from accidental or
unauthorized usage. It is the prerogative of a serving file system to
provide protection, and selective access.  FTP provides identifier and
password mechanisms for exchange of access control information. it
should however ve noted, that for file sharing, it is necessary that a
user be allowed (subject to access controls) to access files not
created by him.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    FTP does not restrict the nature of information in files.  For
example, a file could contain ASCII text, binary data, computer
program, or any other information. A provision for indicating data
structure (type and byte size) exists in FTP to aid in parsing,
interpretation, and storage of data.
    To facilitate impliict usage, a serving file transfer process my
be a disowned "demon" process which "listens" to an agreed-upon
socket, and follows the standard initial connection protocol for
establishing a fill-duplex connection. It should be noted that FTP my
also be used directly by logging into a remote host, and arranging for
file transfer over specific sockets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    FTP is readily extendable, in that additional commands and data
types may be defined by those agreeing to implement them.
Implementation of a subset of commands is specifically permitted, and
an initial subset for implementation is recommended. (*)The protocol
may also be extended to enable remote execution of programs, but no
standard procedure is suggested.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    For transferring data, FTP uses the data transfer protocol
specified in RFC 264. As the data transfer protool does not specify
the manner in which it is to be used by FTP, implementation may vary
at different host sites. Hosts not wishing to separate data transfer
and file transfer functions, should take particular care in conforming
to the data transfer protocol specifications of RFC 264.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    It should be noted that FTP specifications do not require
knowledge of transfer modes used by data transfer protocol.  However,
as file transfer protocol requires the transfer of more than a single
control transaction over the same connection, it is essential that
hosts be able to send control transactions in either 'transparent
block' (type B9) or 'descriptor and counts' (type BA) modes. (Type BS,
the indefinite bit stream mode is not suitable as it limits transfer
to single transactions.).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    The use of data transfer aborts (type B6) is neither required, nor
defined in FTP. FTP has its own error terminate wich may be used to
abort a file transfer request. FTP also does not define to structure
of files, and there are no conventions on the use of group, record and
unit separators. (*)A file separator however, indicates the end of a
file.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    It is strongly recommended that default options be provided in
implementation to facilitate use of file transfer service.  For
example, the main file directora on disk, a pool directory, user
directory of diretory last accessed could serve as standard pathname
defaults. Default mechanisms are convenient, as the user doesn't have
to specify the complete pathname each time ve wishes to use the file
transfer service. No standard default procedures are specified by FTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">--------------------------------
(*)
    This initial subset represents control functions necessary for
basic file transfer and "mail" operations, and some elementary file
manipulation operations. There is no attempt to provide a data
management or complete file management cpability.
(*)
    It is possible that wi may, at a later date, assign meaning to
these information separators within FTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">III. SPECIFICATIONS

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Data Transfer</h2></a>

    FTP uses the Data Transfer Protocol (described in RFC 264)
    for transferring data and/or control transaction. Both data
    and control transactions are communicated over the same
    connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Data Transactions</h2></a>

    Data transactions represent the data contained in a file.
    There is no data type or byte size information contained in
    data transactions. The structure of data communicated via
    control transactions. A file may be transferred as one or
    more data transactions. The protocol neither specifies nor
    impose any limitations on the structure (record, group, etc)
    or length of file. Such limitations may however be imposed
    by a serving host. the end of a file may be indicated by a
    file separator (as defined in data transfer protocol). In
    the special case of indefinite bit-stream transfer mode (Type
    B0), the end of file is indicated by closing connection. In
    particular, a serving or usin host should not send the ETX,
    or other end of file character, unless such a character is
    part of the data in file (i.e. not provided by system).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Control Transactions</h2></a>

    The control transactions may be typified as requests,
    identifiers, and terminates. A request fulfillment sequence
    begins with a request and ends with receipt of data (followed
    by end-of-File) or a terminate. The user side initiates the
    connections as well as the request. The server side "listens"
    and complies with the request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3. A. Op Codes</h2></a>

    The first information (i.e., not descriptor) byte or control
    transactions indicates the control function. This byte is
    referred to as "opcode". A standard set of opcodes are
    defined below. The operations are discussed in Section 2B.2.
    Implementation of a workable subset (*) of opcodes is
    specifically permitted. Additional standard opcodes may be
    assigned later. Opcodes hex 5A (octal 100) through hex FF
    (octal 377) are for experimental use.

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3. B.2 Requests and Identifiers</h2></a>

    Retrieve, create, append, append_with_create, delete, rename_from,
    and rename_to requests must contain a pathname specifying a file,
    following the opcode in the information field. In the list request a
    pathname may or may not follow the opcode. If present, the pathname
    may specify either a file or a directory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    A file pathname must uniquely identify a file in the serving host.
    The syntax of pathnames and identifying information shall conform to
    serving host conventions, except that standard network ASCII (7-bit
    ASCII right justified in 8-bit) field with most signifcant bit as
    zero) shall be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    The store request has a 4-byte (32 bits) 'allocate size' field
    followed by a pathname specifying a file. 'Allocate size' indicates
    the number of bits of storage to be allocated to the file. An
    allocate size of zero indicates that server should use his default.
    Retrieve request achieves the transfer of a copy of file specified
    in pathname, from serving to using host. the status and contents of
    file in serving host should be unaffected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Create request causes a file to be created at the serving host as
    specified in pathname,  A copy of the file is transferred from the
    using to the serving host. If the file specified in pathname already
    exists at the serving host, an error terminate should be sent by the
    server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Store request achieves the transfer of copy of file from using to
    serving host. If file specified in pathname exists on serving hosts,
    then its contents shall be replaced by the contents of the file
    being transferred. A new file is created at the serving host if the
    file specified in pathname does not exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Append request achieves the transfer of data from using to serving
    host. The transferred data is appended to file specified in
    pathname, at serving host. If the specified file does not exist at
    serving host, an error terminate should be sent by the server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Append with create request achieves the transfer of data from using
    to serving host. If file specified is pathname exists at serving
    host, then the transferred data is appended to that file, otherwise
    the file specified in pathname is created at the serving host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Rename from and rename to requests cause the name of the file

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    Delete request causes file specified in pathname to be deleted from

    not be transmitted over network connections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    List request causes a list to be sent from the serving to using

    the cooperating file transfer process at the serving host
    should "listen". (*)The connection establishment will be in
    accordance with the standard initial connection
    protocol, (*)establishing a full-duplex connection.

    NCP's for each of the two connections. Normally, the user
    will initiate CLS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    CLS may also be used by either user or server, to abort a
    transation in the middle. If CLS is received in the middle
    of transaction, the current request fulfillment sequence will
    be aborted. The using host will then reopen connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5. C. It is recommended that identifier (user name and password)</h2></a>
    transactions be sent by user to server, at the start, as this
    would facilitate default handline and access control for the
    entire duration of connection. Some service sites may
    require the indentifier transactions. The identifier
    transactions do not require or permit an acknowledge, and the
    user can proceed directly with requests. If the identifier
    information is incorrect or not received, the server may send
    an error transaction indicating access control, violation,
    upon subsequent requests.
