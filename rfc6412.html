Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State IGP Data-Plane Route Convergence

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes the terminology for benchmarking link-state
   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) route convergence.  The terminology
   is to be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through
   externally observable (black-box) data-plane measurements.  The
   terminology can be applied to any link-state IGP, such as IS-IS and
   OSPF.

   This document is a companion to [Po11m], which contains the
   methodology to be used for benchmarking link-state Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) convergence by observing the data plane.  The purpose
   of this document is to introduce new terms required to complete
   execution of the Link-State IGP Data-Plane Route Convergence
   methodology [Po11m].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IGP convergence time is measured by observing the data plane through
   the Device Under Test (DUT) at the Tester.  The methodology and

   Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [Ca90][Ho08], Open
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) [Mo98] [Co08], and others.

      multiple Streams [Po06], and each Stream SHOULD consist of a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The destination addresses for the Offered Load MUST be distributed

      traffic to all routes, but a statistically representative subset
      of all routes can be used if required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      At least one packet per route for all routes matched in the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Offered Load, IPDV, the number of routes, and the Packet

      it is possible that a Convergence Event causes the Forwarding Rate

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The number of Impaired Packets observed on all DUT egress
      interfaces during convergence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Discussion:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An Impaired Packet is considered as a lost packet.  Connectivity
      Packet Loss is equal to Convergence Packet Loss if the Convergence
      Event causes instantaneous traffic loss for all egress interfaces
      of the DUT except for the Next-Best Egress Interface.

   Definition:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The interval at which the Tester (test equipment) polls to make
      measurements for arriving packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Discussion:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      At least one packet per route for all routes matched in the
      Offered Load MUST be offered to the DUT within the Packet Sampling
      Interval.  Metrics measured at the Packet Sampling Interval MUST
      include Forwarding Rate and received packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Packet Sampling Interval can influence the convergence graph as
      observed with the Rate-Derived Method.  This is particularly true
      when implementations complete Full Convergence in less time than
      the Packet Sampling Interval.  The Convergence Event Instant and
      First Route Convergence Instant may not be easily identifiable,
      and the Rate-Derived Method may produce a larger than actual
      convergence time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Using a small Packet Sampling Interval in the presence of IPDV
      [De02] may cause fluctuations of the Forwarding Rate observation
      and can prevent correct observation of the different convergence
      time instants.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The value of the Packet Sampling Interval only contributes to the
      measurement accuracy of the Rate-Derived Method.  For maximum
      accuracy, the value for the Packet Sampling Interval SHOULD be as
      small as possible, but the presence of IPDV may enforce using a
      larger Packet Sampling Interval.

   Definition:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The amount of time for which the completion of Full Convergence is
      maintained without additional Impaired Packets being observed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Discussion:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The purpose of the Sustained Convergence Validation Time is to
      produce convergence benchmarks protected against fluctuation in
      Forwarding Rate after the completion of Full Convergence is
      observed.  The RECOMMENDED Sustained Convergence Validation Time
      to be used is the time to send 5 consecutive packets to each
      destination with a minimum of 5 seconds.  The Benchmarking
      Methodology Working Group (BMWG) selected 5 seconds based upon
      [Br99], which recommends waiting 2 seconds for residual frames to
      arrive (this is the Forwarding Delay Threshold for the last packet
      sent) and 5 seconds for DUT restabilization.

   Definition:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The maximum waiting time threshold used to distinguish between
      packets with very long delay and lost packets that will never
      arrive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Discussion:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Applying a Forwarding Delay Threshold allows packets with a too
      large Forwarding Delay to be considered lost, as is required for
      some applications (e.g. voice, video, etc.).  The Forwarding Delay
      Threshold is a parameter of the methodology, and it MUST be
      reported.  [Br99] recommends waiting 2 seconds for residual frames
      to arrive.

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.
