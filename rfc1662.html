   This specification provides for framing over both bit-oriented and
   octet-oriented synchronous links, and asynchronous links with 8 bits
   of data and no parity.  These links MUST be full-duplex, but MAY be
   either dedicated or circuit-switched.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An escape mechanism is specified to allow control data such as
   XON/XOFF to be transmitted transparently over the link, and to remove
   spurious control data which may be injected into the link by
   intervening hardware and software.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some protocols expect error free transmission, and either provide
   error detection only on a conditional basis, or do not provide it at
   all.  PPP uses the HDLC Frame Check Sequence for error detection.
   This is commonly available in hardware implementations, and a
   software implementation is provided.

	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Specification of Requirements</h3></a>

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that there
             may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
             ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
             does include the option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Terminology</h3></a>

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).
             A datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets
             passed to the data link layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   frame     The unit of transmission at the data link layer.  A frame
             may include a header and/or a trailer, along with some
             number of units of data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   packet    The basic unit of encapsulation, which is passed across the
             interface between the network layer and the data link
             layer.  A packet is usually mapped to a frame; the
             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation is being
             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated into a
             single frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   peer      The other end of the point-to-point link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   silently discard
             The implementation discards the packet without further
             processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
             capability of logging the error, including the contents of
             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event
             in a statistics counter.

	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Physical Layer Requirements</h2></a>

   PPP is capable of operating across most DTE/DCE interfaces (such as,
   EIA RS-232-E, EIA RS-422, and CCITT V.35).  The only absolute
   requirement imposed by PPP is the provision of a full-duplex circuit,
   either dedicated or circuit-switched, which can operate in either an
   asynchronous (start/stop), bit-synchronous, or octet-synchronous
   mode, transparent to PPP Data Link Layer frames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interface Format

      PPP presents an octet interface to the physical layer.  There is
      no provision for sub-octets to be supplied or accepted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Transmission Rate

      PPP does not impose any restrictions regarding transmission rate,
      other than that of the particular DTE/DCE interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Control Signals

      PPP does not require the use of control signals, such as Request
      To Send (RTS), Clear To Send (CTS), Data Carrier Detect (DCD), and
      Data Terminal Ready (DTR).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When available, using such signals can allow greater functionality
      and performance.  In particular, such signals SHOULD be used to
      signal the Up and Down events in the LCP Option Negotiation
      Automaton [1].  When such signals are not available, the
      implementation MUST signal the Up event to LCP upon
      initialization, and SHOULD NOT signal the Down event.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Because signalling is not required, the physical layer MAY be
      decoupled from the data link layer, hiding the transient details
      of the physical transport.  This has implications for mobility in
      cellular radio networks, and other rapidly switching links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When moving from cell to cell within the same zone, an
      implementation MAY choose to treat the entire zone as a single
      link, even though transmission is switched among several
      frequencies.  The link is considered to be with the central
      control unit for the zone, rather than the individual cell
      transceivers.  However, the link SHOULD re-establish its
      configuration whenever the link is switched to a different
      administration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Due to the bursty nature of data traffic, some implementations
      have choosen to disconnect the physical layer during periods of

      inactivity, and reconnect when traffic resumes, without informing
      the data link layer.  Robust implementations should avoid using
      this trick over-zealously, since the price for decreased setup
      latency is decreased security.  Implementations SHOULD signal the
      Down event whenever "significant time" has elapsed since the link
      was disconnected.  The value for "significant time" is a matter of
      considerable debate, and is based on the tariffs, call setup
      times, and security concerns of the installation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   The Data Link Layer</h2></a>

   PPP uses the principles described in ISO 3309-1979 HDLC frame
   structure, most recently the fourth edition 3309:1991 [2], which
   specifies modifications to allow HDLC use in asynchronous
   environments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PPP control procedures use the Control field encodings described

      above recommendations are included in PPP.  Each feature included
      is explicitly described in the following sections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To remain consistent with standard Internet practice, and avoid
   confusion for people used to reading RFCs, all binary numbers in the
   following descriptions are in Most Significant Bit to Least

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Flag Sequence

      Each frame begins and ends with a Flag Sequence, which is the
      binary sequence 01111110 (hexadecimal 0x7e).  All implementations

   Control Field

      The Control field is a single octet, which contains the binary

      When using the standard HDLC-like framing, the Address and Control
      fields contain the hexadecimal values 0xff and 0x03 respectively.

   01111110 (hexadecimal 0x7e).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">

	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Transparency</h3></a>

   An octet stuffing procedure is used.  The Control Escape octet is

   first.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As a minimum, sending implementations MUST escape the Flag Sequence
   and Control Escape octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After FCS computation, the transmitter examines the entire frame
   between the two Flag Sequences.  Each Flag Sequence, Control Escape
   octet, and any octet which is flagged in the sending Async-Control-

   of the Control Escape octet followed by the original octet

   Robust transmitters should avoid using this trick over-zealously,
   since the price for decreased delay is decreased reliability.  Noisy
   links may cause the receiver to receive garbage characters and
   interpret them as part of an incoming frame.  If the transmitter does

      This Configuration Option provides a method to negotiate the use
      of control character transparency on asynchronous links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Each end of the asynchronous link maintains two Async-Control-
      Character-Maps.  The receiving ACCM is 32 bits, but the sending
      ACCM may be up to 256 bits.  This results in four distinct ACCMs,
      two in each direction of the link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For asynchronous links, the default receiving ACCM is 0xffffffff.
      The default sending ACCM is 0xffffffff, plus the Control Escape
      and Flag Sequence characters themselves, plus whatever other
      outgoing characters are flagged (by prior configuration) as likely
      to be intercepted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For other types of links, the default value is 0, since there is
      no need for mapping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         The default inclusion of all octets less than hexadecimal 0x20
         allows all ASCII control characters [6] excluding DEL (Delete)
         to be transparently communicated through all known data

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The transmitter MAY also send octets with values in the range 0x40
      through 0xff (except 0x5e) in Control Escape format.  Since these
      octet values are not negotiable, this does not solve the problem
      of receivers which cannot handle all non-control characters.
      Also, since the technique does not affect the 8th bit, this does
      not solve problems for communications links that can send only 7-
      bit characters.

         Note that this specification differs in detail from later

   frame, whenever 03 and ff are taken as the control characters ETX and
   DEL without regard to parity (they are correct for an even parity
   link) and discarded.

   packet mode when one of the above username patterns are detected
   during login, without examining the initial PPP checksum.  The
   initial incoming PPP frame is discarded, but a Configure-Request is
   sent immediately.

   calculating the received FCS until it detects the Flag Sequence.

Security Considerations

   As noted in the Physical Layer Requirements section, the link layer
   might not be informed when the connected state of the physical layer
   has changed.  This results in possible security lapses due to over-
   reliance on the integrity and security of switching systems and
   administrations.  An insertion attack might be undetected.  An
   attacker which is able to spoof the same calling identity might be
   able to avoid link authentication.
