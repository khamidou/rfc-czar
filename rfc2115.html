	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management framework are
   described in the documents listed below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    RFC 1902 [1] defines the Structure of Management
        Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and
        naming objects for the purpose of management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
        managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    RFC 1905 [3] defines the protocol used for network access
        to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to suit
   the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the
   MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In particular, each
   object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an
   administratively assigned name. The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object. For human convenience, often a textual string, termed
   the descriptor, is used to refer to the object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Frame Relay Operational Model</h3></a>

   For the purposes of understanding this document, Frame Relay is
   viewed as a multi-access media, not as a group of point- to-point
   connections. This model proposes that Frame Relay is a single
   interface to the network (physical connection) with many destinations
   or neighbors (virtual connections). This view enables a network
   manager the ability to group all virtual connections with their
   corresponding physical connection thereby allowing simpler
   diagnostics and trouble shooting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With the extension of the interfaces MIB, it is possible to configure
   frame relay DLCs as individual interfaces and create ifTable entries
   for each. This is not recommended and is not directly supported by
   this MIB. Additionally, in the presence of demand circuits creation
   of individual ifEntries for each is not possible.
   Should the user wish to group DLCs together to associate them with a
   higher layer, or to associate a DLC with an unnumbered point-to-point
   service, the frame relay DTE MIB provides an entry in the
   frCircuitEntry record. For example, suppose one were to configure a
   company proprietary protocol to run above several of the frame relay
   VCs. The basic layering would look something like the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      IP (ipaddrEntry 1 )  IP (ipaddrEntry 2)  IP (ipaddrEntry 3)

                                              logical ifIndex 3)

A configuration which specified that DLCI 40, 41,and 42 were associated
with a proprietary protocol layer, while DLCI 20 and 30 were to run IP
directly can now be expressed using a combination of frCircuitIfIndex
and frCircuitLogicalIfIndex.  In this particular case DLCIs 40, 41 and
	<a name="section-42"><h2>42.  would use frCircuitIfIndex equal to the frame relay interface level</h2></a>
(2) while their frCircuitLogicalIfIndex would indicate the proprietary<br>
protocol (3). DLCIs 20 and 30 would have both instances set to the frame<br>
relay interface (2).<br>

	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Textual Conventions</h3></a>

   One new data type is introduced as a textual convention in this MIB
   document.  This textual convention enhances the readability of the
   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if
   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of this
   textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of this is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate this textual conventions which is
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The new data type is DLCI.  DLCI refers to the range 0..DLCINumber,
   and is used to refer to the valid Data Link Connection Indices.
   DLCINumber is, by definition, the largest possible DLCI value
   possible under the configured Q.922 Address Format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Structure of MIB</h3></a>

   The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining the Data Link
   Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing the Circuits,
   and a third describing errors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   During normal operation, Frame Relay virtual circuits will be added,
   deleted and change availability. The occurrence of such changes is of
   interest to the network manager and therefore, one trap is defined,
   intended to be corollary to the SNMP "Link Up" and "Link Down" traps.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Changes from RFC 1315</h2></a>

   Below are listed the changes from the previously published version
   this document, which was RFC 1315:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    The MIB module was converted from SMIv1 to SMIv2 format.
        Note: due to this, the table indices have access of
        "read-only" instead of "not-accessible", which is the
        typical value for index objects in SMIv2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    The module name was changed from RFC1315-MIB to FRAME-
        RELAY-DTE-MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    The textual convention "Index" was dropped from the MIB
        module and "InterfaceIndex" from the interfaces MIB
        module, IF-MIB, was used in its place.
   o    Objects frDlcmiStatus and frDlcmiRowStatus were added to
        table frDlcmiTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Added values "itut933A(5)" (from CCITT Q933 Annex A) and<br>
        "ansiT1617D1994(6)" (from ANSI T1.617a-1994 Annex D) to<br>
        the enumerations for object frDlcmiState.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    The labels for the enumerated values for object
        frDlcmiAddressLen were renamed to remove their hyphens as
        required by SMIv2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Added clarification that the "management virtual circuit"
        (i.e. DLCI 0) is a member of the circuit table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Added the following objects to table frCircuitTable:
        frCircuitMulticast, frCircuitType, frCircuitDiscards,
        frCircuitReceivedDEs, frCircuitSentDEs,
        frCircuitLogicalIfIndex, and  frCircuitRowStatus.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    The definition of object frCircuitReceivedOctets was
        clarified as to which octets were counted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Added the objects frErrFaults and frErrFaultTime to table
        frErrTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Added clarification to the values of object frErrType.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Added size on definition of object frErrData and
        clarified what data to capture.

        from frame-relay-globals to frameRelayTrapControl.

        frTrapGroup0, and frErrGroup0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o    Created notification group frNotificationGroup.
