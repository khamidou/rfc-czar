</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo reclassifies RFC 1863, A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative
   to a full mesh routing, to Historic status.  This memo also obsoletes
   RFC 1863.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Reclassification of RFC 1863 to Historic</h2></a>

   RFC 1863 [1] describes the use of route servers as an alternative to
   BGP/IDRP full mesh routing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the context of this document, the term "RFC 1863 route server" is
   used to refer to a route server as specified in RFC 1863.  Other uses
   of the term "route server" are outside the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations of RFC 1863 route servers do not exist and are not
   used as an alternative to full mesh routing.  Therefore, RFC 1863 is
   reclassified to Historic status.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Current techniques that serve as an alternative to full mesh routing
   include BGP Route Reflectors [2], BGP Confederedations [3], and the
   use of private AS numbers.  IDRP for IP has never been standardized
   by the IETF and can be considered obsolete.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other uses of (non-RFC1863) route servers, rather than as an
   alternative to full mesh routing as described by RFC 1863, are
   expected to continue to be used for multiple purposes, but are out of
   the scope of this memo.

   useful background information for the creation of this memo.  Scott
   Bradner, Jeffrey Haas, and Yakov Rekhter provided substantial
   feedback during the WG last call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Reclassifying RFC 1863 has no security considerations.
