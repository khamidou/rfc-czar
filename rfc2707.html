</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document provides a printer industry standard SNMP MIB for (1)
   monitoring the status and progress of print jobs (2) obtaining<br>
   resource requirements before a job is processed, (3) monitoring<br>
   resource consumption while a job is being processed and (4)
   collecting resource accounting data after the completion of a job.
   This MIB is intended to be implemented (1) in a printer or (2) in a<br>
   server that supports one or more printers.  Use of the object set is
   not limited to printing.  However, support for services other than
   printing is outside the scope of this Job Monitoring MIB.  Future
   extensions to this MIB may include, but are not limited to, fax
   machines and scanners.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This specification defines an official Printer Working Group (PWG)
   [PWG] standard SNMP MIB for the monitoring of jobs on network
   printers.  This specification is being published as an IETF
   Information Document for the convenience of the Internet community.
   In consultation with the IETF Application Area Directors, it was
   concluded that this MIB specification properly belongs as an
   Information document, because this MIB monitors a service node on the
   network, rather than a network node proper.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Job Monitoring MIB is intended to be implemented by an agent
   within a printer or the first server closest to the printer, where
   the printer is either directly connected to the server only or the
   printer does not contain the job monitoring MIB agent.  It is
   recommended that implementations place the SNMP agent as close as
   possible to the processing of the print job.  This MIB applies to
   printers with and without spooling capabilities.  This MIB is
   designed to be compatible with most current commonly-used job
   submission protocols.  In most environments that support high
   function job submission/job control protocols, like ISO DPA [iso-
   dpa], those protocols would be used to monitor and manage print jobs
   rather than using the Job Monitoring MIB.
   The Job Monitoring MIB consists of a General Group, a Job Submission
   ID Group, a Job Group, and an Attribute Group.  Each group is a
   table.  All accessible objects are read-only.  The General Group
   contains general information that applies to all jobs in a job set.
   The Job Submission ID table maps the job submission ID that the
   client uses to identify a job to the jmJobIndex that the Job
   Monitoring Agent uses to identify jobs in the Job and Attribute
   tables.  The Job table contains the MANDATORY integer job state and
   status objects.  The Attribute table consists of multiple entries per
   job that specify (1) job and document identification and parameters,<br>
   (2) requested resources, and (3) consumed resources during and after<br>
   job processing/printing.  A larger number of job attributes are
   defined as textual conventions that an agent SHALL return if the
   server or device implements the functionality so represented and the
   agent has access to the information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1  Types of Information in the MIB</h3></a>

   The job MIB is intended to provide the following information for the
   indicated Role Models in the Printer MIB [print-mib] (Appendix D -
   Roles of Users).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      User:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Provide the ability to identify the least busy printer.  The
         user will be able to determine the number and size of jobs
         waiting for each printer.  No attempt is made to actually
         predict the length of time that jobs will take.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Provide the ability to identify the current status of the
         user's job (user queries).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Provide a timely indication that the job has completed and
         where it can be found.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MIB supports printers that can contain more than one job at a

   Windows and other PC environments for managing low-end direct-connect
   (serial or parallel) and networked devices without unnecessary
   overhead or complexity, while also providing for higher end systems
   and devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2  Types of Job Monitoring Applications</h3></a>

   The Job Monitoring MIB is designed for the following types of
   monitoring applications:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        1. Monitor a single job starting when the job is submitted and
           ending a defined period after the job completes.  The Job
           Submission ID table provides the map to find the specific job
           to be monitored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        2. Monitor all 'active' jobs in a queue, which this
           specification generalizes to a "job set".  End users may use
           such a program when selecting a least busy printer, so the
           MIB is designed for such a program to start up quickly and
           find the information needed quickly without having to read
           all (completed) jobs in order to find the active jobs.
           System operators may also use such a program, in which case
           it would be running for a long period of time and may also be
           interested in the jobs that have completed.  Finally such a
           program may be used to provide an enhanced console and
           logging capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        3. Collect resource usage for accounting or system utilization
           purposes that copy the completed job statistics to an
           accounting system. It is recognized that depending on
           accounting programs to copy MIB data during the job-retention
           period is somewhat unreliable, since the accounting program
           may not be running (or may have crashed).  Such a program is
           also expected to keep a shadow copy of the entire Job
           Attribute table including completed, canceled, and aborted
           jobs which the program updates on each polling cycle.  Such a
           program polls at the rate of the persistence of the Attribute
           table.  The design is not optimized to help such an
           application determine which jobs are completed, canceled, or
           aborted.  Instead, the application SHOULD query each job that
           the application's shadow copy shows was not complete,
           canceled, or aborted at the previous poll cycle to see if it
           is now complete or canceled, plus any new jobs that have been
           submitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MIB provides a set of objects that represent a compatible subset
   of job and document attributes of the ISO DPA standard [iso-dpa] and
   the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) [ipp-model], so that coherence
   is maintained between these two protocols and the information
   presented to end users and system operators by monitoring
   applications.  However, the job monitoring MIB is intended to be used
   with printers that implement other job submitting and management
   protocols, such as IEEE 1284.1 (TIPSI) [tipsi], as well as with ones
   that do implement ISO DPA.  Thus the job monitoring MIB does not
   require implementation of either the ISO DPA or IPP protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MIB is designed so that an additional MIB(s) can be specified in
   the future for monitoring multi-function (scan, FAX, copy) jobs as an
   augmentation to this MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology and Job Model</h2></a>

   This section defines the terms that are used in this specification
   and the general model for jobs in alphabetical order.
      NOTE - Existing systems use conflicting terms, so these terms are
      drawn from the ISO 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA)
      standard [iso-dpa].  For example, PostScript systems use the term
      session for what is called a job in this specification and the
      term job to mean what is called a document in this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Accounting Application:  The SNMP management application that copies
   job information to some more permanent medium so that another
   application can perform accounting on the data for Accountants, Asset
   Managers, and Capacity Planners use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Agent:  The network entity that accepts SNMP requests from a monitor
   or accounting application and provides access to the instrumentation
   for managing jobs modeled by the management objects defined in the
   Job Monitoring MIB module for a server or a device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Attribute:  A name, value-pair that specifies a job or document
   instruction, a status, or a condition of a job or a document that has
   been submitted to a server or device.  A particular attribute NEED
   NOT be present in each job instance.  In other words, attributes are
   present in a job instance only when there is a need to express the
   value, either because (1) the client supplied a value in the job<br>
   submission protocol, (2) the document data contained an embedded<br>
   attribute, or (3) the server or device supplied a default value.  An<br>
   agent MAY represent an attribute as an entry (row) in the Attribute
   table in this MIB in which entries are present only when necessary.
   Attributes are identified in this MIB by an enum.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Client:  The network entity that end users use to submit jobs to
   spoolers, servers, or printers and other devices, depending on the
   configuration, using any job submission protocol over a serial or
   parallel port to a directly-connected device or over the network to a
   networked-connected device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Device:  A hardware entity that (1) interfaces to humans, such as a<br>
   device that produces marks on paper or scans marks on paper to
   produce an electronic representation, (2) accesses digital media,<br>
   such as CD-ROMs, or (3) interfaces electronically to another device,<br>
   such as sends FAX data to another FAX device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Document:  A sub-section within a job that contains print data and
   document instructions that apply to just the document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Document Instruction:  An instruction specifying how to process the
   document.  Document instructions MAY be passed in the job submission
   protocol separate from the actual document data, or MAY be embedded
   in the document data or a combination, depending on the job
   submission protocol and implementation.
   End User:  A user that uses a client to submit a print job.  See
   "user".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Impression:  For a print job, an impression is the passage of the
   entire side of a sheet by the marker, whether or not any marks are
   made and independent of the number of passes that the side makes past
   the marker.  Thus a four pass color process counts as a single
   impression, as does highlight color.  Impression counters count all
   kinds:  monochrome, highlight color, and full process color, while
   full color counters only count full color impressions, and high light
   color counters only count high light color impressions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One-sided processing involves one impression per sheet.  Two-sided
   processing involves two impressions per sheet.  If a two-sided
   document has an odd number of pages, the last sheet still counts as
   two impressions, if that sheet makes two passes through the marker or
   the marker marks on both sides of a sheet in a single pass.  Two-up
   printing is the placement of two logical pages on one side of a sheet
   and so is still a single impression.  See "page" and "sheet".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE - Since impressions include blank sides, it is suggested that
   accounting application implementers consider charging for sheets,
   rather than impressions, possibly using the value of the sides
   attribute to select different charges for one-sided versus two-sided
   printing, since some users may think that impressions don't include
   blank sides.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Internal Collation: The production of the sheets for each document
   copy performed within the printing device by making multiple passes
   over either the source or an intermediate representation of the
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Job:  A unit of work whose results are expected together without
   interjection of unrelated results.  A job contains one or more
   documents.

   accessing the MIB and recording what happens to the job during and
   after the processing of the job.

   job is to be processed.  Job instructions MAY be passed in the job
   submission protocol or MAY be embedded in the document data or a
   combination depending on the job submission protocol and
   implementation.
   Job Monitoring (using SNMP):  The activity of a management
   application of accessing the MIB and (1) identifying jobs in the job<br>
   tables being processed by the server, printer or other devices, and
   (2) displaying information to the user about the processing of the<br>
   job.

   Users, and System Operators use to monitor jobs using SNMP.  A
   monitor MAY be either a separate application or MAY be part of the
   client that also submits jobs.  See "monitor".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Job Set:  A group of jobs that are queued and scheduled together
   according to a specified scheduling algorithm for a specified device
   or set of devices.  For implementations that embed the SNMP agent in
   the device, the MIB job set normally represents all the jobs known to
   the device, so that the implementation only implements a single job
   set.  If the SNMP agent is implemented in a server that controls one
   or more devices, each MIB job set represents a job queue for (1) a<br>
   specific device or (2) set of devices, if the server uses a single<br>
   queue to load balance between several devices.  Each job set is
   disjoint; no job SHALL be represented in more than one MIB job set.

      option

      "NEED NOT":  indicates an action that the subject of the sentence
      does not have to implement in order to claim conformance to this

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  The Job Tables and the Oldest Active and Newest Active Indexes</h3></a>

   The jmJobTable and jmAttributeTable contain objects and attributes,
   respectively, for each job in a job set.  These first two indexes
   are:
        1. jmGeneralJobSetIndex - which job set
        2. jmJobIndex - which job in the job set

   In order for a monitoring application to quickly find that active
   jobs (jobs in the pending, processing, or processingStopped states),
   the MIB contains two indexes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        1. jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex - the index of the active job
           that has been in the tables the longest.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        2. jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex - the index of the active job
           that has been most recently added to the tables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The agent SHALL assign the next incremental value of jmJobIndex to
   the job, when a new job is accepted by the server or device to which
   the agent is providing access.  If the incremented value of
   jmJobIndex would exceed the implementation-defined maximum value for
   jmJobIndex, the agent SHALL 'wrap' back to 1.  An agent uses the
   resulting value of jmJobIndex for storing information in the
   jmJobTable and the jmAttributeTable about the job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that the largest value for jmJobIndex be much
   larger than the maximum number of jobs that the implementation can
   contain at a single time, so as to minimize the premature re-use of a
   jmJobIndex value for a newer job while clients retain the same '
   stale' value for an older job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that agents that are providing access to
   servers/devices that already allocate job-identifiers for jobs as
   integers use the same integer value for the jmJobIndex.  Then
   management applications using this MIB and applications using other
   protocols will see the same job identifiers for the same jobs.
   Agents providing access to systems that contain jobs with a job
   identifier of 0 SHALL map the job identifier value 0 to a jmJobIndex
   value that is one higher than the highest job identifier value that
   any job can have on that system.  Then only job 0 will have a
   different job-identifier value than the job's jmJobIndex value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE - If a server or device accepts jobs using multiple job
   submission protocols, it may be difficult for the agent to meet the
   recommendation to use the job-identifier values that the server or
   device assigns as the jmJobIndex value, unless the server/device
   assigns job-identifiers for each of its job submission protocols from
   the same job-identifier number space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each time a new job is accepted by the server or device that the
   agent is providing access to AND that job is to be 'active' (pending,
   processing, or processingStopped, but not pendingHeld), the agent
   SHALL copy the value of the job's jmJobIndex to the
   jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex object.  If the new job is to be '
   inactive' (pendingHeld state), the agent SHALL not change the value
   of jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex object (though the agent SHALL
   assign the next incremental jmJobIndex value to the job).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a job transitions from one of the 'active' job states (pending,
   processing, processingStopped) to one of the 'inactive' job states
   (pendingHeld, completed, canceled, or aborted), with a jmJobIndex
   value that matches the jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex object, the
   agent SHALL advance (or wrap) the value to the next oldest 'active'
   job, if any.  See the JmJobStateTC textual-convention for a
   definition of the job states.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Whenever a job transitions from one of the 'inactive' job states to
   one of the 'active' job states (from pendingHeld to pending or
   processing), the agent SHALL update the value of either the
   jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex or the jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex
   objects, or both, if the job's jmJobIndex value is outside the range
   between jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex and
   jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When all jobs become 'inactive', i.e., enter the pendingHeld,
   completed, canceled, or aborted states, the agent SHALL set the value
   of both the jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex and
   jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex objects to 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE - Applications that wish to efficiently access all of the active
   jobs MAY use jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex value to start with the
   oldest active job and continue until they reach the index value equal
   to jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex, skipping over any pendingHeld,
   completed, canceled, or aborted jobs that might intervene.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an application detects that the jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex is
   smaller than jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex, the job index has
   wrapped.  In this case, the application SHALL reset the index to 1
   when the end of the table is reached and continue the GetNext
   operations to find the rest of the active jobs.
   NOTE - Applications detect the end of the jmAttributeTable table when
   the OID returned by the GetNext operation is an OID in a different
   MIB.  There is no object in this MIB that specifies the maximum value
   for the jmJobIndex supported by the implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the server or device is power-cycled, the agent SHALL remember
   the next jmJobIndex value to be assigned, so that new jobs are not
   assigned the same jmJobIndex as recent jobs before the power cycle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3  The Attribute Mechanism and the Attribute Table(s)</h3></a>

   Attributes are similar to information objects, except that attributes
   are identified by an enum, instead of an OID, so that attributes may
   be registered without requiring a new MIB.  Also an implementation
   that does not have the functionality represented by the attribute can
   omit the attribute entirely, rather than having to return a
   distinguished value.  The agent is free to materialize an attribute
   in the jmAttributeTable as soon as the agent is aware of the value of
   the attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The agent materializes job attributes in a four-indexed
   jmAttributeTable:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        1. jmGeneralJobSetIndex - which job set

        2. jmJobIndex - which job in the job set

        3. jmAttributeTypeIndex - which attribute

        4. jmAttributeInstanceIndex - which attribute instance for those
           attributes that can have multiple values per job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some attributes represent information about a job, such as a file-
   name, a document-name, a submission-time or a completion time.  Other
   attributes represent resources required, e.g., a medium or a
   colorant, etc. to process the job before the job starts processing OR
   to indicate the amount of the resource consumed during and after
   processing, e.g., pages completed or impressions completed.  If both
   a required and a consumed value of a resource is needed, this
   specification assigns two separate attribute enums in the textual
   convention.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE - The table of contents lists all the attributes in order.  This
   order is the order of enum assignments which is the order that the
   SNMP GetNext operation returns attributes.  Most attributes apply to
   all three configurations covered by this MIB specification (see
   section 2.1 entitled "System Configurations for the Job Monitoring
   MIB").  Those attributes that apply to a particular configuration are
   indicated as 'Configuration n:' and SHALL NOT be used with other
   configurations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1  Conformance of Attribute Implementation</h4></a>

   An agent SHALL implement any attribute if (1) the server or device<br>
   supports the functionality represented by the attribute and (2) the<br>
   information is available to the agent.  The agent MAY create the
   attribute row in the jmAttributeTable when the information is
   available or MAY create the row earlier with the designated 'unknown'
   value appropriate for that attribute.  See next section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the server or device does not implement or does not provide access
   to the information about an attribute, the agent SHOULD NOT create
   the corresponding row in the jmAttributeTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2  Useful, 'Unknown', and 'Other' Values for Objects and Attributes</h4></a>

   Some attributes have a 'useful' Integer32 value, some have a 'useful'
   OCTET STRING value, some MAY have either or both depending on
   implementation, and some MUST have both.  See the JmAttributeTypeTC
   textual convention for the specification of each attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMP requires that if an object cannot be implemented because its
   values cannot be accessed, then a compliant agent SHALL return an
   SNMP error in SNMPv1 or an exception value in SNMPv2.  However, this
   MIB has been designed so that 'all' objects can and SHALL be
   implemented by an agent, so that neither the SNMPv1 error nor the
   SNMPv2 exception value SHALL be generated by the agent.  This MIB has
   also been designed so that when an agent materializes an attribute,
   the agent SHALL materialize a row consisting of both the
   jmAttributeValueAsInteger and jmAttributeValueAsOctets objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In general, values for objects and attributes have been chosen so
   that a management application will be able to determine whether a '
   useful', 'unknown', or 'other' value is available.  When a useful
   value is not available for an object, that agent SHALL return a
   zero-length string for octet strings, the value 'unknown(2)' for<br>
   enums, a '0' value for an object that represents an index in another
   table, and a value '-2' for counting integers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since each attribute is represented by a row consisting of both the
   jmAttributeValueAsInteger and jmAttributeValueAsOctets MANDATORY
   objects, SNMP requires that the agent SHALL always create an
   attribute row with both objects specified.  However, for most
   attributes the agent SHALL return a "useful" value for one of the
   objects and SHALL return the 'other' value for the other object.  For
   integer only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a zero-length
   string value for the jmAttributeValueAsOctets object.  For octet
   string only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a '-1' value
   for the jmAttributeValueAsInteger object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.3"><h4>3.3.3  Index Value Attributes</h4></a>

   A number of attributes are indexes in other tables.  Such attribute

   an index value for a particular index attribute for a job, the agent
   SHALL either: (1) return the value 0 or (2) not add this attribute to<br>
   the jmAttributeTable until the index value is assigned.  In the
   interests of brevity, the semantics for 0 is specified once here and
   is not repeated for each index attribute specification and a DEFVAL
   of 0 is implied, even though the DEFVAL for jmAttributeValueAsInteger
   is -2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.4"><h4>3.3.4  Data Sub-types and Attribute Naming Conventions</h4></a>

   Many attributes are sub-typed to give a more specific data type than
   Integer32 or OCTET STRING.  The data sub-type of each attribute is
   indicated on the first line(s) of the description.  Some attributes
   have several different data sub-type representations.  When an
   attribute has both an Integer32 data sub-type and an OCTET STRING
   data sub-type, the attribute can be represented in a single row in
   the jmAttributeTable.  In this case, the data sub-type name is not
   included as the last part of the name of the attribute, e.g.,
   documentFormat(38) which is both an enum and/or a name.  When the<br>
   data sub-types cannot be represented by a single row in the
   jmAttributeTable, each such representation is considered a separate
   attribute and is assigned a separate name and enum value.  For these
   attributes, the name of the data sub-type is the last part of the
   name of the attribute: Name, Index, DateAndTime, TimeStamp, etc.  For
   example, documentFormatIndex(37) is an index.<br>

        general and arbitrary services can be created, such as
        services with more than one destination type, or ones with
        only a source or only a destination.  For example, a job

        a great deal of time processing (1) when no marking is happening<br>
        and then want to show that marking is now happening or (2) when<br>
        the job is in the process of being canceled or aborted while the
        job remains in the processing state, but the marking has not yet
        stopped so that impression or sheet counts are still increasing
        for the job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    jobCanceledByUser                 0x2000
        The job was canceled by the owner of the job, i.e., by a user

        server/device is still performing some actions on the job until
        a specified stop point occurs or job termination/cleanup is
        completed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        This reason is recommended to be used in conjunction with the

   submission protocols:
    jobPaused                         0x400000
        The job has been indefinitely suspended by a client issuing an
        operation to suspend the job so that other jobs may proceed
        using the same devices.  The client MAY issue an operation to
        resume the paused job at any time, in which case the agent SHALL
        remove the jobPaused values from the job's jmJobStateReasons1
        object and the job is eventually resumed at or near the point
        where the job was paused.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    jobInterrupted                    0x800000 The job has been
        interrupted while processing by a client
        issuing an operation that specifies another job to be run
        instead of the current job.  The server or device will
        automatically resume the interrupted job when the interrupting
        job completes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    jobRetained                       0x1000000
        The job is being retained by the server or device with all of
        the job's document data (and submitted resources, such as fonts,
        logos, and forms, if any).  Thus a client could issue an
        operation to the server or device to either (1) re-do the job<br>
        (or a copy of the job) on the same server or device or (2)
        resubmit the job to another server or device.  When a client
        could no longer re-do/resubmit the job, such as after the
        document data has been discarded, the agent SHALL remove the
        jobRetained value from the jmJobStateReasons1 object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4  Monitoring Job Progress</h3></a>

   There are a number of objects and attributes for monitoring the
   progress of a job.  These objects and attributes count the number of
   K octets, impressions, sheets, and pages requested or completed.  For
   impressions and sheets, "completed" means stacked, unless the
   implementation is unable to detect when each sheet is stacked, in
   which case stacked is approximated when processing of each sheet
   completes.  There are objects and attributes for the overall job and
   for the current copy of the document currently being stacked.  For
   the latter, the rate at which the various objects and attributes
   count depends on the sheet and document collation of the job.
   Job Collation included sheet collation and document collation.  Sheet
   collation is defined to be the ordering of sheets within a document
   copy.  Document collation is defined to be ordering of document
   copies within a multi-document job.  There are three types of job
   collation (see terminology definitions in Section 2):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     1.uncollatedSheets(3) - No collation of the sheets within each<br>
       document copy, i.e., each sheet of a document that is to produce
       multiple copies is replicated before the next sheet in the
       document is processed and stacked.  If the device has an output
       bin collator, the uncollatedSheets(3) value may actually produce<br>
       collated sheets as far as the user is concerned (in the output
       bins).  However, when the job collation is the to a monitoring
       application between a device that has an output bin collator and
       one that does not.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     2.collatedDocuments(4) - Collation of the sheets within each<br>
       document copy is performed within the printing device by making
       multiple passes over either the source or an intermediate
       representation of the document.  In addition, when there are
       multiple documents per job, the i'th copy of each document is
       stacked before the j'th copy of each document, i.e., the
       documents are collated within each job copy.  For example, if a
       job is submitted with documents, A and B, the job is made
       available to the end user as: A, B, A, B, ....  The '
       collatedDocuments(4)' value corresponds to the IPP [ipp-model] '<br>
       separate-documents-collated-copies' value of the "multiple-
       document-handling" attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       If jobCopiesRequested or documentCopiesRequested = 1, then

       multiple documents per job, all copies of the first document in
       the job are stacked before the any copied of the next document in
       the job, i.e., the documents are uncollated within the job.  For
       example, if a job is submitted with documents, A and B, the job
       is mad available to the end user as:  A, A, ..., B, B, ....  The

	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5  Job Identification</h3></a>

   There are a number of attributes that permit a user, operator or
   system administrator to identify jobs of interest, such as jobURI,
   jobName, jobOriginatingHost, etc.  In addition, there is a
   jmJobSubmissionID object that is a text string table index.  Being a
   table index allows a monitoring application to quickly locate and
   identify a particular job of interest that was submitted from a
   particular client by the user invoking the monitoring application
   without having to scan the entire job table.  The Job Monitoring MIB
   needs to provide for identification of the job at both sides of the
   job submission process.  The primary identification point is the
   client side.  The jmJobSubmissionID allows the monitoring application
   to identify the job of interest from all the jobs currently "known"
   by the server or device.  The value of jmJobSubmissionID can be
   assigned by either the client's local system or a downstream server
   or device.  The point of assignment depends on the job submission
   protocol in use.
   The server/device-side identifier, called the jmJobIndex object,
   SHALL be assigned by the SNMP Job Monitoring MIB agent when the
   server or device accepts the jobs from submitting clients.  The
   jmJobIndex object allows the interested party to obtain all objects
   desired that relate to a particular job.  See Section 3.2, entitled '
   The Job Tables and the Oldest Active and Newest Active Indexes' for
   the specification of how the agent SHALL assign the jmJobIndex
   values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MIB provides a mapping table that maps each jmJobSubmissionID
   value to a corresponding jmJobIndex value generated by the agent, so
   that an application can determine the correct value for the
   jmJobIndex value for the job of interest in a single Get operation,
   given the Job Submission ID.  See the jmJobIDGroup.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In some configurations there may be more than one application program
   that monitors the same job when the job passes from one network
   entity to another when it is submitted.  See configuration 3.  When
   there are multiple job submission IDs, each entity MAY supply an
   appropriate jmJobSubmissionID value.  In this case there would be a
   separate entry in the jmJobSubmissionID table, one for each
   jmJobSubmissionID.  All entries would map to the same jmJobIndex that
   contains the job data.  When the job is deleted, it is up to the
   agent to remove all entries that point to the job from the
   jmJobSubmissionID table as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The jobName attribute provides a name that the user supplies as a job
   attribute with the job.  The jobName attribute is not necessarily
   unique, even for one user, let alone across users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.5.1"><h4>3.5.1  The Job Submission ID specifications</h4></a>

   This section specifies the formats for each of the registered Job
   Submission Ids.  This format is used by the JmJobSubmissionIDTypeTC.
   Each job submission ID is a fixed-length, 48-octet printable US-ASCII
   [US-ASCII] coded character string containing no control characters,
   consisting of the following fields:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          octet  1:  The format letter identifying the format.  The
            US-ASCII characters '0-9', 'A-Z', and 'a-z' are assigned
            in order giving 62 possible formats.
          octets 2-40:  A 39-character, US-ASCII trailing SPACE
            filled field specified by the format letter, if the data
            is less than 39 ASCII characters.
          octets 41-48:  A sequential or random US-ASCII number to
            make the ID quasi-unique.
   If the client does not supply a job submission ID in the job
   submission protocol, then the agent SHALL assign a job submission ID
   using any of the standard formats that are reserved for the agent.
   Clients SHALL not use formats that are reserved for agents and agents
   SHALL NOT use formats that are reserved for clients, in order to
   reduce conflicts in ID generation.  See the description for which
   formats are reserved for clients or for agents.

   procedures described in Section 3.7.3.

   This section describes the internationalization considerations
   included in this MIB.
	<a name="section-3.6.1"><h4>3.6.1  Text generated by the server or device</h4></a>

   There are a few objects and attributes generated by the server or
   device that SHALL be represented using the Universal Multiple-Octet
   Coded Character Set (UCS) [ISO-10646].  These objects and attributes
   are always supplied (if implemented) by the agent, not by the job
   submitting client:
      1. jmGeneralJobSetName object
      2. processingMessage(6) attribute<br>
      3. physicalDevice(32) (name value) attribute<br>

   The character encoding scheme for representing these objects and
   attributes SHALL be UTF-8 as REQUIRED by RFC 2277 [RFC2277].  The '
   JmUTF8StringTC' textual convention is used to indicate UTF-8 text
   strings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE - For strings in 7-bit US-ASCII, there is no impact since the
   UTF-8 representation of 7-bit ASCII is identical to the US-ASCII
   [US-ASCII] encoding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The text contained in the processingMessage(6) attribute is generated<br>
   by the server/device.  The natural language for the
   processingMessage(6) attribute is identified by the<br>
   processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) attribute.  The<br>
   processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) attribute uses the<br>
   JmNaturalLanguageTagTC textual convention which SHALL conform to the
   language tag mechanism specified in RFC 1766 [RFC1766].  The
   JmNaturalLanguageTagTC value is the same as the IPP [ipp-model] '
   naturalLanguage' attribute syntax.  RFC 1766 specifies that a US-
   ASCII string consisting of the natural language followed by an
   optional country field. Both fields use the same two-character codes
   from ISO 639 [ISO-639] and ISO 3166 [ISO-3166], respectively, that
   are used in the Printer MIB for identifying language and country.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Examples of the values of the processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7)

        1. 'en'    for English
        2. 'en-us' for US English
        3. 'fr'    for French
        4. 'de'    for German

	<a name="section-3.6.2"><h4>3.6.2  Text supplied by the job submitter</h4></a>

   All of the objects and attributes represented by the 'JmJobStringTC'
   textual-convention are either (1) supplied in the job submission<br>
   protocol by the client that submits the job to the server or device
   or (2) are defaulted by the server or device if the job submitting<br>
   client does not supply values.  The agent SHALL represent these
   objects and attributes in the MIB either (1) in the coded character<br>
   set as they were submitted or (2) MAY convert the coded character set<br>
   to another coded character set or encoding scheme.  In any case, the
   resulting coded character set representation SHOULD be UTF-8 [UTF-8],
   but SHALL be one in which the code positions from 0 to 31 is not
   used, 32 to 127 is US-ASCII [US-ASCII], 127 is not unused, and the
   remaining code positions 128 to 255 represent single-byte or multi-
   byte graphic characters structured according to ISO 2022 [ISO-2022]
   or are unused.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The coded character set SHALL be one of the ones registered with IANA
   [IANA] and SHALL be identified by the jobCodedCharSet attribute in
   the jmJobAttributeTable for the job.  If the agent does not know what
   coded character set was used by the job submitting client, the agent
   SHALL either (1) return the 'unknown(2)' value for the<br>
   jobCodedCharSet attribute or (2) not return the jobCodedCharSet<br>
   attribute for the job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Examples of coded character sets which meet this criteria for use as
   the value of the jobCodedCharSet job attribute are: US-ASCII [US-

   mechanism.  If the keyword value is not known to the monitoring
   application, the monitoring application SHOULD assume that the value
   is in the natural language specified by the job's

   This MIB does not require any additional registration schemes for

   3.character-sets - used as enums in the jobCodedCharSet(8) attribute<br>

   The Printer Working Group (PWG) will handle registration of
   additional enums after approving this standard, according to the
   procedures described in this section:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.7.1"><h4>3.7.1  PWG Registration of enums</h4></a>

   This specification uses textual conventions to define enumerated
   values (enums) and bit values.  Enumerations (enums) and bit values
   are sets of symbolic values defined for use with one or more objects
   or attributes.  All enumeration sets and bit value sets are assigned
   a symbolic data type name (textual convention).  As a convention the
   symbolic name ends in "TC" for textual convention.  These
   enumerations are defined at the beginning of the MIB module
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PWG has defined several type of enumerations for use in the Job
   Monitoring MIB and the Printer MIB [print-mib].  These types differ
   in the method employed to control the addition of new enumerations.
   Throughout this document, references to "type n enum", where n can be
   1, 2 or 3 can be found in the various tables.  The definitions of
   these types of enumerations are:

   Type 1 enumeration:  All the values are defined in the Job Monitoring
   MIB specification (RFC for the Job Monitoring MIB).  Additional

        3. JmJobStateReasons2TC
        4. JmJobStateReasons3TC
        5. JmJobStateReasons4TC

   These textual-conventions are defined as bits in an Integer so that

	<a name="section-3.8.1"><h4>3.8.1  Read-Write objects</h4></a>

   All objects are read-only, greatly simplifying the security
   considerations.  If another MIB augments this MIB, that MIB might
   accept SNMP Write operations to objects in that MIB whose effect is
   to modify the values of read-only objects in this MIB.  However, that
   MIB SHALL have to support the required access control in order to
   achieve security, not this MIB.
	<a name="section-3.8.2"><h4>3.8.2  Read-Only Objects In Other User's Jobs</h4></a>

   The security policy of some sites MAY be that unprivileged users can
   only get the objects from jobs that they submitted, plus a few
   minimal objects from other jobs, such as the
   jmJobKOctetsPerCopyRequested and jmJobKOctetsProcessed objects, so
   that a user can tell how busy a printer is.  Other sites MAY allow
   all unprivileged users to see all objects of all jobs.  This MIB does
   not require, nor does it specify how, such restrictions would be
   implemented.  A monitoring application SHOULD enforce the site
   security policy with respect to returning information to an
   unprivileged end user that is using the monitoring application to
   monitor jobs that do not belong to that user, i.e., the jmJobOwner
   object in the jmJobTable does not match the user's user name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An operator is a privileged user that would be able to see all
   objects of all jobs, independent of the policy for unprivileged
   users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.9"><h3>3.9  Notifications</h3></a>

   This MIB does not specify any notifications.  For simplicity,
   management applications are expected to poll for status.  The
   jmGeneralJobPersistence and jmGeneralAttributePersistence objects
   assist an application to determine the polling rate.  The resulting
   network traffic is not expected to be significant.

JmJobServiceTypesTC ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Specifies the type(s) of service to which the job has been
        submitted (print, fax, scan, etc.).  The service type is
        represented as an enum that is bit encoded with each job
        service type so that more general and arbitrary services can be
        created, such as services with more than one destination type,
        or ones with only a source or only a destination.  For example,
        a job service might scan, faxOut, and print a single job.  In
        this case, three bits would be set in the jobServiceTypes
        attribute, corresponding to the hexadecimal values: 0x8 + 0x20
        + 0x4, respectively, yielding: 0x2C.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Whether this attribute is set from a job attribute supplied by
        the job submission client or is set by the recipient job
        submission server or device depends on the job submission
        protocol.  With either implementation, the agent SHALL return a
        non-zero value for this attribute indicating the type of the
        job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        One of the purposes of this attribute is to permit a requester
        to filter out jobs that are not of interest.  For example, a
        printer operator MAY only be interested in jobs that include
        printing.  That is why the attribute is in the job
        identification category.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        The following service component types are defined (in
        hexadecimal) and are assigned a separate bit value for use with
        the jobServiceTypes attribute:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        other                             0x1
            The job contains some instructions that are not one of the
            identified types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        unknown                           0x2
            The job contains some instructions whose type is unknown to
            the agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        print                             0x4
            The job contains some instructions that specify printing

        faxIn                             0x10
            The job contains some instructions that specify receive fax

        faxOut                            0x20
            The job contains some instructions that specify sending fax

        getFile                           0x40
            The job contains some instructions that specify accessing
            files or documents

        putFile                           0x80
            The job contains some instructions that specify storing
            files or documents

        mailList                          0x100

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Appendix A - Implementing the Job Life Cycle</h2></a>

   The job object has well-defined states and client operations that
   affect the transition between the job states.  Internal server and
   device actions also affect the transitions of the job between the job
   states.  These states and transitions are referred to as the job's
   life cycle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Not all implementations of job submission protocols have all of the
   states of the job model specified here.  The job model specified here
   is intended to be a superset of most implementations.  It is the
   purpose of the agent to map the particular implementation's job life
   cycle onto the one specified here.  The agent MAY omit any states not
   implemented.  Only the processing and completed states are required
   to be implemented by an agent.  However, a conforming management
   application SHALL be prepared to accept any of the states in the job
   life cycle specified here, so that the management application can
   interoperate with any conforming agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The job states are intended to be user visible.  The agent SHALL make
   these states visible in the MIB, but only for the subset of job
   states that the implementation has.  Some implementations MAY need to
   have sub-states of these user-visible states.  The jmJobStateReasons1
   object and the jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4) attributes can be used to
   represent the sub-states of the jobs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Job states are intended to last a user-visible length of time in most
   implementations.  However, some jobs may pass through some states in
   zero time in some situations and/or in some implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The job model does not specify how accounting and auditing is
   implemented, except to assume that accounting and auditing logs are
   separate from the job life cycle and last longer than job entries in
   the MIB.  Jobs in the completed, aborted, or canceled states are not
   logs, since jobs in these states are accessible via SNMP protocol
   operations and SHALL be removed from the Job Monitoring MIB tables
   after a site-settable or implementation-defined period of time.  An
   accounting application MAY copy accounting information incrementally
   to an accounting log as a job processes, or MAY be copied while the
   job is in the canceled, aborted, or completed states, depending on
   implementation.  The same is true for auditing logs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The jmJobState object specifies the standard job states.  The normal
   job state transitions are shown in the state transition diagram
   presented in Figure 4.
	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   APPENDIX B - Support of Job Submission Protocols</h2></a>

   A companion PWG document, entitled "Job Submission Protocol Mapping
   Recommendations for the Job Monitoring MIB" [protomap] contains the
   recommended usage of each of the objects and attributes in this MIB
   with a number of job submission protocols.  In particular, which job
   submission ID format should be used is indicated for each job
   submission protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some job submission protocols have support for the client to specify
   a job submission ID.  A second approach is to enhance the document
   format to embed the job submission ID in the document data.  This
   second approach is independent of the job submission protocol.  This
   appendix lists some examples of these approaches.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some PJL implementations wrap a banner page as a PJL job around a job
   submitted by a client.  If this results in multiple job submission
   IDs, the agent SHALL create multiple jmJobIDEntry rows in the
   jmJobIDTable that each point to the same job entry in the job tables.
   See the specification of the jmJobIDEntry.
