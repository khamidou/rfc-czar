   SDP and RTSP Extensions Defined for 3GPP Packet-Switched Streaming
           Service and Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) and the Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) defined by 3GPP use the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
   with some extensions.  This document provides information about these
   extensions and registers the RTSP and SDP extensions with IANA.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) that
   uses both RTSP [RFC2326] and SDP [RFC4566].  The service is specified
   in technical specifications TS 26.233 [PSS-233] and TS 26.234
   [PSS-234] in Release 4 and subsequent releases.  The basic service
   defined in Release 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with capability
   exchange, and in Release 6 with a number of features, such as
   adaptation, digital rights management (DRM), progressive download, as
   well as a streaming server file format defined in [PSS-3GP].  Fast
   start-up and content switching are addressed in Release 7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
   (MBMS) that uses SDP.  The IP-layer protocols used by this service
   are specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 [MBMS].
   Release 7 extends the MBMS User Service to also work with unicast
   bearers for interactive and streaming traffic classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the process of defining these services, there has occasionally
   been a need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionalities.  These
   extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP
   headers and option tags. 3GPP uses the name "feature tags" (like RTSP
   2.0 for what RTSP 1.0 calls "option tags"); "option tag" is the name
   that will be used in this document.  The purpose of this
   informational document is to register these SDP and RTSP extensions,
   in order to avoid future conflicts, and also to raise the awareness
   of their existence within IETF.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In Section 5.4, this document defines three SDP protocol identifiers
   used in MBMS to enable the usage of block-based FEC.  The SDP
   protocol identifiers require an RFC to be defined and registered.  As
   this is an RFC from the IETF stream, any semantic change will require
   a new IETF-approved RFC.  The other SDP and RTSP extensions
   registered by this document are not normatively defined in this
   document.  Instead, the normative definitions are referenced by the
   registrations. 3GPP can update the normative definition in future
   versions of their specifications.  However, to ensure that such a
   change is visible in the IETF, at minimum, IANA should be notified
   and the reference to the 3GPP specification updated, and preferably
   an updated version of this RFC published.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The document begins with two sections presenting the SDP extensions
   for PSS and MBMS, respectively.  They are followed by a section
   noting that offer/answer considerations are not applicable here.  The
   subsequent section presents the extensions of RTSP for PSS.  The IANA
   registration of SDP attributes and protocol identifiers is given in
   Section 8.1, and the RTSP headers and option tags in Section 8.2.
   For normative descriptions of all SDP and RTSP extensions, we refer
   to TS 26.234 [PSS-234] and TS 26.346 [MBMS].

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Applicability Statement</h2></a>

   This document describes 3GPP-defined extensions to SDP [RFC4566] and
   RTSP [RFC2326] and registers attributes that are normatively defined
   in 3GPP technical specifications 26.234, 26.244, and 26.346, up to
   the referenced versions of the respective documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SDP and RTSP extensions have only been defined for usage with the
   3GPP service in mind.  The applicability for usage outside of these
   services has not been considered nor addressed.  Usage of these
   attributes in other contexts may require further definitions or
   clarifications.  For example, all SDP attributes lack offer/answer
   usage rules [RFC3264], which currently makes it impossible to use
   them with offer/answer.  Please note that change control of these SDP
   and RTSP extensions belongs to 3GPP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   PSS SDP Extensions</h2></a>

   The PSS specification [PSS-234] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes.  They are listed below, grouped by
   their purpose.  The text is intentionally not specific enough to
   allow implementation from this document.  The normative definition is
   in the 3GPP technical specification cited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Video Buffering Attributes</h3></a>

   The following attributes are used to provide parameters for the video
   buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].
   The attributes were defined in Release 5 as "X-" attributes and, at
   the time, were not considered for registration.  In hindsight,
   however, they should not have been "X-" attributes, and they should
   have been registered, as the registration rules of SDP [RFC4566]
   point out.  Changing their names today is impossible due to the
   deployed base of millions of mobile handsets supporting PSS, and
   therefore they are registered in their current form.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All attributes are defined at media level.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The "a=X-predecbufsize" attribute provides the size of the pre-
      decoder buffer in bytes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" attribute provides the time during
      which a receiver should initially buffer, in 90 kHz ticks, before
      starting to consume the data in the buffer in order to ensure that
      underflow does not occur, assuming correct data delivery.
   o  The "a=X-initpostdecbufperiod" attribute provides the initial
      buffering period, in 90 kHz ticks, for the post-decoder buffer
      present in H.263 and MPEG-4 Visual.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The "a=X-decbyterate" attribute indicates the maximum peak byte-
      decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer model
      expressed in bytes per second.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The "a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize" attribute is used to indicate the
      value used in determining the H.264 video post-decoder buffer
      size.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that complete descriptions of these attributes can be found in
   Section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Video Frame Size Attribute</h3></a>

   This media-level attribute provides the receiver with the largest
   picture size that a specific H.263 payload type will carry within the
   session.  The attribute has the following form (see Section 5.3.3.2
   of [PSS-234]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "a=framesize:<payload type number> <width>-<height>"

	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Integrity-Protection Configuration Attributes</h3></a>

   These attributes are all used to configure the integrity-protection
   mechanism defined in Annex K (Sections K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2, and K.2.2.3)
   of [PSS-234].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-Integrity-Key" carries the
      integrity key used to derive SRTP master keys for integrity
      protection.  The key is protected in different ways depending on a
      method identifier.  When using Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM key
      management, the key is encrypted using AES [AES] before it is
      base64 encoded [RFC4648].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The media-level attribute "a=3GPP-SRTP-Config" is used to
      configure SRTP for integrity protection and contains an integrity
      nonce, a key salt used in deriving the SRTP master key from the
      integrity key, and any SRTP configuration parameters, such as the
      integrity tag length.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-SDP-Auth" is used to carry an
      authentication tag calculated over certain parts of the SDP to
      prevent manipulation of the security attributes.
	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   The Alternative Attributes</h3></a>

   Two media-level and one session-level attributes are used in a
   mechanism for providing alternative SDP lines.  One or more SDP lines
   at media level can be replaced, if desired, by alternatives.  The
   mechanism is backwards compatible in the way that a receiver that
   does not support the attributes will get the default configuration.
   The different alternatives can be grouped using different attributes
   that can be specified hierarchically with a top and a lower level.
   3GPP Release 6 supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the
   SDP bandwidth modifiers AS [RFC4566] and TIAS [RFC3890], and
   language.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SDP attributes (see Sections 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of [PSS-234])
   are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The media-level attribute "a=alt:<id>:<SDP-Line>" carries any SDP
      line and an alternative identifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The media-level attribute "a=alt-default-id:<id>" identifies the
      default configuration to be used in groupings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The session-level attribute "a=alt-group" is used to group
      different recommended media alternatives.  This allows providing
      aggregated properties for the whole group according to the
      grouping type.  Language and bit-rate are two defined grouping
      types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Adaptation Attribute</h3></a>

   The media-level SDP attribute "a=3GPP-Adaptation-Support" (see
   Section 5.3.3.5 in [PSS-234]) is defined as part of the negotiation
   procedure of the PSS adaptation mechanism.  The attribute carries a
   single value indicating how often the RTCP "Next Application Data
   Unit" (NADU) APP packet shall be included in sent RTCP compound
   packets.  The adaptation mechanism allows the client to provide the
   server with information on the available transmission bit-rate and
   receiver buffer status.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   Quality of Experience Attribute</h3></a>

   The session- and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-QoE-Metrics" (see
   Section 5.3.3.6 of [PSS-234]) is used to negotiate the usage of the
   QoE metrics.  The included parameters indicate which metrics should
   be used, over which duration there should be measurements, and how
   often reports should be sent.
	<a name="section-4.7"><h3>4.7   Asset Information Attribute</h3></a>

   The session- and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-Asset-Information"
   (see Section 5.3.3.7 of [PSS-234]) can exist in multiple instances in
   a description and describes different types of asset information.
   The different asset classes defined in Release 6 are Title,
   Description, Copyright, Performer, Author, Genre, Rating,
   Classification, Keywords, Location, Album, and Recording Year.  The
   different assets are described with a base64-encoded asset box from
   the 3GP file format [PSS-3GP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   MBMS SDP Extensions</h2></a>

   The MBMS specification [MBMS] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes.  They are informatively listed
   below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   MBMS Bearer Mode Declaration Attribute</h3></a>

   The session- and media-level attribute "a=mbms-mode" (see Section
   7.3.2.7 of [MBMS]) is used to describe MBMS broadcast mode media.
   The attribute may be used at the session level to set the default for
   all media and at the media level to specify differences between
   media.  However, the attribute is never used at the session level
   when the session includes MBMS multicast mode media, nor at the media
   level to describe MBMS multicast mode media.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   FEC Flow ID Attribute</h3></a>

   The media-level attribute "a=mbms-flowid" (see Section 8.3.1.9 of
   [MBMS]) maps one or more FEC source block flow IDs to their
   corresponding destination IP addresses and UDP port numbers.  It is
   present in each SDP media block for repair packet streams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   MBMS Repair Attribute</h3></a>

   The session- and media-level attribute "a=mbms-repair" (see Section
   8.3.1.8 of [MBMS]) is used to provide FEC repair packets with non-FEC
   specific parameters.  For Release 6, one such parameter is defined to
   specify the required minimum receiver buffer time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   SDP Protocol Identifiers for FEC</h3></a>

   MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-based FEC for UDP-based
   traffic.  This solution uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
   identify the media streams that use the FEC shim layer.  The media
   streams may be either source streams or repair streams.  As required
   by SDP [RFC4566], these protocol identifiers are normatively defined
   in this document in accordance with their usage specified by 3GPP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4.1"><h4>5.4.1   RTP Protocol Identifiers</h4></a>

   For FEC-protected RTP streams, the following two "proto" identifiers
   are defined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP

   o  UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/SAVP

   They indicate the usage of UDP [RFC0768] with MBMS FEC source packet
   formats, as defined in Section 8.2.2.4 of [MBMS], that transport RTP
   packets in accordance with the AVP [RFC3551] or SAVP (Secure RTP)
   [RFC3711] profiles, respectively.  These protocol identifiers SHALL
   use the media formats ("fmt") namespace rules that are used for RTP/
   AVP and RTP/SAVP, respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4.2"><h4>5.4.2   FEC Repair Data Identifier</h4></a>

   A media stream carrying MBMS FEC repair information over UDP requires
   its own "proto" identifier.  Protocol identifier "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR"
   identifies the FEC repair packet containing the protocol combination
   of UDP [RFC0768], FEC repair payload ID, and repair symbols as
   specified in Section 8.2.2.5 of [MBMS].  The "fmt" namespace is not
   used and SHALL be set to "*".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   Video Buffering Attribute</h3></a>

   The PSS media-level buffer attribute "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" (see
   Section 4.1) that specifies an initial buffering time is also used
   for MBMS in Release 7.  It is mainly intended for video streams, but
   may be used for other media types as well (see Section 8.3.1.1 of
   [MBMS]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   SDP Offer/Answer Consideration</h2></a>

   The usage of the SDP attributes in an offer/answer [RFC3264] context
   is not defined.  These SDP attributes are defined for use in a
   declarative context, and for PSS specifically in the RTSP [RFC2326]
   context.
	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   PSS RTSP Extensions</h2></a>

   The RTSP extensions for PSS consist of a number of new RTSP headers
   and option tags and a narrowing of URI usage in regards to 3GP files.
   The headers and option tags are informatively described here; see
   [PSS-234] for the normative declaration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   3GPP-Link-Char Header</h3></a>

   The "3GPP-Link-Char" header (see Section 5.3.2.1 of [PSS-234]) is
   used by clients to provide the server with QoS information about the
   wireless link it is currently using.  The header can be used to
   provide the server with three different QoS parameters:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth

   o  Maximum Bandwidth

   o  Maximum Transfer Delay

   The header may be included in RTSP requests using either of the
   methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS, or SET_PARAMETER.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   3GPP-Adaptation Header</h3></a>

   The "3GPP-Adaptation" header (see Section 5.3.2.2 of [PSS-234]) is
   used by the client to provide the server with adaptation-related
   parameters and to indicate support of the adaptation function.  The
   header carries the resource identification as a URI, the client's
   buffer size, and the desired target time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The header may be included in requests using the methods SETUP, PLAY,
   OPTIONS, and SET_PARAMETER.  The response to a request using this
   method shall include this header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3   3GPP-QoE-Metrics Header</h3></a>

   The "3GPP-QoE-Metrics" header (see Section 5.3.2.3.1 of [PSS-234]) is
   used to negotiate the usage of the QoE metrics (see Section 11 of
   [PSS-234]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The header may be included in requests and responses using the SETUP,
   SET_PARAMETER, OPTIONS, or PLAY method.
	<a name="section-7.4"><h3>7.4   3GPP-QoE-Feedback Header</h3></a>

   The "3GPP-QoE-Feedback" header (see Section 5.3.2.3.2 of [PSS-234])
   is used to carry QoE metrics from the client to the server when it
   reports, which happens either during or at the end of the media
   delivery.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The header may be included in requests using the SET_PARAMETER,
   PAUSE, or TEARDOWN method.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.5"><h3>7.5   Video Buffer Headers</h3></a>

   PSS uses several headers to provide the client with the different
   buffer parameters.  They provide the buffer status at the point of a
   stream from which a PLAY request plays.  These headers may only be
   used in PLAY responses.  See Section 5.3.2.4 and Annex G of [PSS-234]
   for normative definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The three "x-" headers were defined in 3GPP Release 5.  When it was
   realized that they should not have been given "x-" names, it was too
   late to rename them due to deployment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RTSP headers are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  x-predecbufsize

   o  x-initpredecbufperiod

   o  x-initpostdecbufperiod

   o  3gpp-videopostdecbufsize

	<a name="section-7.6"><h3>7.6   Integrity Protection</h3></a>

   The integrity-protection mechanism defined in PSS Annex K uses the
   "3GPP-Freshness-Token" RTSP header (see Section K.2.2.4 of [PSS-234])
   to carry a freshness token in DESCRIBE requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.7"><h3>7.7   RTSP URI Extension</h3></a>

   The PSS specification also defines syntax for referencing tracks
   within the 3GP file format [PSS-3GP].  The 3GP format is based on the
   ISO base media file format and is defined in several different
   profiles, including a streaming-server profile, in Release 6.
   This syntax is fully contained within the generic URI syntax defined
   for RTSP URIs.  It is only a syntax restriction that server
   manufacturers follow to allow clients or proxies to understand what
   encodes the track number in the URI.  This is provided for
   information only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To identify a track within a 3GP file, the last URI segment has to
   contain a structure that is <alpha string>=<track nr>.  (See Section
   5.3.3.1 of [PSS-234].)

	<a name="section-7.8"><h3>7.8   Fast Start-Up and Content Switching</h3></a>

   Release 7 of PSS defines a number of extensions in terms of headers
   and option tags (see Section 5.5 of [PSS-234]) for support of fast
   start-up and switching of content for on-demand and live applications
   built on top of PSS.  Clients are enabled to reuse the existing RTSP
   control session and RTP resources while switching to new content.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RTSP headers are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Switch-Stream

   o  SDP-Requested

   o  Pipelined-Requests

   The RTSP option tags are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  3gpp-pipelined

   o  3gpp-switch

   o  3gpp-switch-req-sdp

   o  3gpp-switch-stream

	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   SDP attributes are subject to modification by an attacker unless they
   are integrity protected and authenticated.  The security
   considerations of the SDP specification [RFC4566] should be reviewed
   in this regard.  The registered SDP attributes are vulnerable to
   modification attacks or removal, which may result in problems of a
   serious nature, including failure to use service and reduced quality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The registered RTSP headers are also vulnerable to insertion,
   deletion, or modification attacks similar to SDP attributes.  Also in
   this case, attacks can result in failure of the service or reduced
   quality of streaming content.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The three SDP protocol identifiers do not by themselves introduce any
   additional security threats that don't exist for other protocol
   identifiers in SDP.  The media stream and the used protocols
   identified and configured by the SDP protocol identifier may,
   however, contain security issues by themselves.
