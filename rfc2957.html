   This document defines the expression of Whois++ protocol (RFC 1835)
   queries within MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) (RFC
   2046) media types.  The intention of this document, in conjunction
   with RFC 2958 is to enable MIME-enabled mail software, and other
   systems using Internet media types, to carry out Whois++
   transactions.

   The following grammar, which uses BNF-like notation as defined in
   [RFC2234] defines the set of acceptable input to a Whois++ server.
   As such, it describes the expected structure of a whoispp-query media
   type object.

   literals are in the US-ASCII character set, and are case-insensitive.
