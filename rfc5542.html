<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module that
   contains textual conventions (TCs) to represent commonly used
   pseudowire (PW) management information.  The intent is that these TCs
   will be imported and used in PW-related MIB modules that would
   otherwise define their own representations.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines textual conventions used for pseudowire
   (PW) technology and for Pseudowire Edge-to-Edge Emulation (PWE3) MIB
   modules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h2></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects
   in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure

   that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC
   2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
