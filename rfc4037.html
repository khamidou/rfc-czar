</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document specifies the core of the Open Pluggable Edge Services
   (OPES) Callout Protocol (OCP).  OCP marshals application messages
   from other communication protocols: An OPES intermediary sends
   original application messages to a callout server; the callout server
   sends adapted application messages back to the processor.  OCP is
   designed with typical adaptation tasks in mind (e.g., virus and spam
   management, language and format translation, message anonymization,
   or advertisement manipulation).  As defined in this document, the OCP
   Core consists of application-agnostic mechanisms essential for
   efficient support of typical adaptations.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) architecture [RFC3835]
   enables cooperative application services (OPES services) between a
   data provider, a data consumer, and zero or more OPES processors.
   The application services under consideration analyze and possibly
   transform application-level messages exchanged between the data
   provider and the data consumer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OPES processor can delegate the responsibility of service
   execution by communicating with callout servers.  As described in
   [RFC3836], an OPES processor invokes and communicates with services
   on a callout server by using an OPES callout protocol (OCP).  This
   document specifies the core of that protocol ("OCP Core").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OCP Core specification documents general application-independent
   protocol mechanisms.  A separate series of documents describes
   application-specific aspects of OCP.  For example, "HTTP Adaptation
   with OPES" [OPES-HTTP] describes, in part, how HTTP messages and HTTP
   meta-information can be communicated over OCP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 1.2 provides a brief overview of the entire OPES document
   collection, including documents describing OPES use cases and
   security threats.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Scope</h3></a>

   The OCP Core specification documents the behavior of OCP agents and
   the requirements for OCP extensions.  OCP Core does not contain
   requirements or mechanisms specific for application protocols being
   adapted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As an application proxy, the OPES processor proxies a single
   application protocol or converts from one application protocol to
   another.  At the same time, OPES processor may be an OCP client,
   using OCP to facilitate adaptation of proxied messages at callout
   servers.  It is therefore natural to assume that an OPES processor
   takes application messages being proxied, marshals them over OCP to
   callout servers, and then puts the adaptation results back on the
   wire.  However, this assumption implies that OCP is applied directly
   to application messages that OPES processor is proxying, which may
   not be the case.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      OPES processor scope                         callout server scope<pre>
      +-----------------+                           +-----------------+
      | pre-processing  |         OCP scope         |                 |
      |            +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+            |
      | iteration  |     <== ( application data ) ==>    | adaptation |
      |            +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+            |
      | post-processing |                           |                 |
      +-----------------+                           +-----------------+

   An OPES processor may preprocess (or postprocess) proxied application
   messages before (or after) they are adapted at callout servers.  For
   example, a processor may take an HTTP response being proxied and pass
   it as-is, along with metadata about the corresponding HTTP
   connection.  Another processor may take an HTTP response, extract its
   body, and pass that body along with the content-encoding metadata.
   Moreover, to perform adaptation, the OPES processor may execute
   several callout services, iterating over several callout servers.
   Such preprocessing, postprocessing, and iterations make it impossible
   to rely on any specific relationship between application messages
   being proxied and application messages being sent to a callout
   service.  Similarly, specific adaptation actions at the callout
   server are outside OCP Core scope.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification does not define or require any specific
   relationship among application messages being proxied by an OPES
   processor and application messages being exchanged between an OPES
   processor and a callout server via OCP.  The OPES processor usually
   provides some mapping among these application messages, but the
   processor's specific actions are beyond OCP scope.  In other words,
   this specification is not concerned with the OPES processor role as
   an application proxy or as an iterator of callout services.  The
   scope of OCP Core is communication between a single OPES processor
   and a single callout server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Furthermore, an OPES processor may choose which proxied application
   messages or information about them to send over OCP.  All proxied
   messages on all proxied connections (if connections are defined for a
   given application protocol), everything on some connections, selected
   proxied messages, or nothing might be sent over OCP to callout
   servers.  OPES processor and callout server state related to proxied
   protocols can be relayed over OCP as application message metadata.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   OPES Document Map</h3></a>

   This document belongs to a large set of OPES specifications produced
   by the IETF OPES Working Group.  Familiarity with the overall OPES
   approach and typical scenarios is often essential when one tries to
   comprehend isolated OPES documents.  This section provides an index
   of OPES documents to assist the reader with finding "missing"
   information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  "OPES Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios" [RFC3752] describes a
      set of services and applications that are considered in scope for
      OPES and that have been used as a motivation and guidance in
      designing the OPES architecture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The OPES architecture and common terminology are described in "An
      Architecture for Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)" [RFC3835].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  "Policy, Authorization, and Enforcement Requirements of OPES"
      [RFC3838] outlines requirements and assumptions on the policy
      framework, without specifying concrete authorization and
      enforcement methods.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  "Security Threats and Risks for OPES" [RFC3837] provides OPES risk
      analysis, without recommending specific solutions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  "OPES Treatment of IAB Considerations" [RFC3914] addresses all
      architecture-level considerations expressed by the IETF Internet
      Architecture Board (IAB) when the OPES WG was chartered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  At the core of the OPES architecture are the OPES processor and
      the callout server, two network elements that communicate with
      each other via an OPES Callout Protocol (OCP).  The requirements
      for this protocol are discussed in "Requirements for OPES Callout
      Protocols" [RFC3836].
   o  This document specifies an application agnostic protocol core to
      be used for the communication between an OPES processor and a
      callout server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  "OPES Entities and End Points Communications" [RFC3897] specifies
      generic tracing and bypass mechanisms for OPES.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The OCP Core and communications documents are independent from the
      application protocol being adapted by OPES entities.  Their
      generic mechanisms have to be complemented by application-specific
      profiles.  "HTTP Adaptation with OPES" [OPES-HTTP] is such an
      application profile for HTTP.  It specifies how
      application-agnostic OPES mechanisms are to be used and augmented
      in order to support adaptation of HTTP messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Finally, "P: Message Processing Language" [OPES-RULES] defines a
      language for specifying what OPES adaptations (e.g., translation)
      must be applied to what application messages (e.g., e-mail from
      bob@example.com).  P language is intended for configuring
      application proxies (OPES processors).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   Terminology</h3></a>

   In this document, the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].  When used with the normative meanings, these keywords
   will be all uppercase.  Occurrences of these words in lowercase
   constitute normal prose usage, with no normative implications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OPES processor works with messages from application protocols and
   may relay information about those application messages to a callout
   server.  OCP is also an application protocol.  Thus, protocol
   elements such as "message", "connection", or "transaction" exist in
   OCP and other application protocols.  In this specification, all
   references to elements from application protocols other than OCP are
   used with an explicit "application" qualifier.  References without
   the "application" qualifier refer to OCP elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP message: A basic unit of communication between an OPES processor
      and a callout server.  The message is a sequence of octets
      formatted according to syntax rules (section 3.1).  Message
      semantics is defined in section 11.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   application message: An entity defined by OPES processor and callout
      server negotiation.  Usually, the negotiated definition would
      match the definition from an application protocol (e.g., [RFC2616]
      definition of an HTTP message).
   application message data: An opaque sequence of octets representing a
      complete or partial application message.  OCP Core does not
      distinguish application message structures (if there are any).
      Application message data may be empty.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   data: Same as application message data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   original: Referring to an application message flowing from the OPES
      processor to a callout server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   adapted: Referring to an application message flowing from an OPES
      callout server to the OPES processor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   adaptation: Any kind of access by a callout server, including
      modification, generation, and copying.  For example, translating
      or logging an SMTP message is adaptation of that application
      message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   agent: The actor for a given communication protocol.  The OPES
      processor and callout server are OCP agents.  An agent can be
      referred to as a sender or receiver, depending on its actions in a
      particular context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   immediate: Performing the specified action before reacting to new
      incoming messages or sending any new messages unrelated to the
      specified action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP extension: A specification extending or adjusting this document
      for adaptation of an application protocol (a.k.a., application
      profile; e.g., [OPES-HTTP]), new OCP functionality (e.g.,
      transport encryption and authentication), and/or new OCP Core
      version.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overall Operation</h2></a>

   The OPES processor may use the OPES callout protocol (OCP) to
   communicate with callout servers.  Adaptation using callout services
   is sometimes called "bump in the wire" architecture.

   The OPES processor establishes transport connections with callout
   servers to exchange application messages with the callout server(s)
   by using OCP.  After a transport-layer connection (usually TCP/IP) is
   established, communicating OCP agents exchange Connection Start (CS)
   messages.  Next, OCP features can be negotiated between the processor
   and the callout server (see section 6).  For example, OCP agents may
   negotiate transport encryption and application message definition.
   When enough settings are negotiated, OCP agents may start exchanging
   application messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP Core provides negotiation and other mechanisms for agents to
   encrypt OCP connections and authenticate each other.  OCP Core does
   not require OCP connection encryption or agent authentication.
   Application profiles and other OCP extensions may document and/or
   require these and other security mechanisms.  OCP is expected to be
   used, in part, in closed environments where trust and privacy are
   established by means external to OCP.  Implementations are expected
   to demand necessary security features via the OCP Core negotiation
   mechanism, depending on agent configuration and environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Original Dataflow</h3></a>

   When the OPES processor wants to adapt an application message, it
   sends a Transaction Start (TS) message to initiate an OCP transaction
   dedicated to that application message.  The processor then sends an
   Application Message Start (AMS) message to prepare the callout server
   for application data that will follow.  Once the application message
   scope is established, application data can be sent to the callout
   server by using Data Use Mine (DUM) and related OCP message(s).  All
   of these messages correspond to the original dataflow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Adapted Dataflow</h3></a>

   The callout server receives data and metadata sent by the OPES
   processor (original dataflow).  The callout server analyses metadata
   and adapts data as it comes in.  The server usually builds its
   version of metadata and responds to the OPES processor with an
   Application Message Start (AMS) message.  Adapted application message
   data can be sent next, using Data Use Mine (DUM) OCP message(s).  The
   application message is then announced to be "completed" or "closed"
   by using an Application Message End (AME) message.  The transaction
   may be closed by using a Transaction End (TE) message, as well.  All
   these messages correspond to adapted data flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       +---------------+                             +-------+
       |     OPES      | == (original data flow) ==> |callout|
       |   processor   | <== (adapted data flow) === |server |
       +---------------+                             +-------+

   The OPES processor receives the adapted application message sent by
   the callout server.  Other OPES processor actions specific to the
   application message received are outside scope of this specification.
	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Multiple Application Messages</h3></a>

   OCP Core specifies a transactions interface dedicated to exchanging a
   single original application message and a single adapted application
   message.  Some application protocols may require multiple adapted
   versions for a single original application message or even multiple
   original messages to be exchanged as a part of a single OCP
   transaction.  For example, a single original e-mail message may need
   to be transformed into several e-mail messages, with one custom
   message for each recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP extensions MAY document mechanisms for exchanging multiple
   original and/or multiple adapted application messages within a single
   OCP transaction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5"><h3>2.5   Termination</h3></a>

   Either OCP agent can terminate application message delivery,
   transaction, or connection by sending an appropriate OCP message.
   Usually, the callout server terminates adapted application message
   delivery and the transaction.  Premature and abnormal terminations at
   arbitrary times are supported.  The termination message includes a
   result description.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.6"><h3>2.6   Message Exchange Patterns</h3></a>

   In addition to messages carrying application data, OCP agents may
   also exchange messages related to their configuration, state,
   transport connections, application connections, etc.  A callout
   server may remove itself from the application message processing
   loop.  A single OPES processor can communicate with many callout
   servers and vice versa.  Though many OCP exchange patterns do not
   follow a classic client-server model, it is possible to think of an
   OPES processor as an "OCP client" and of a callout server as an "OCP
   server".  The OPES architecture document [RFC3835] describes
   configuration possibilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following informal rules illustrate relationships between
   connections, transactions, OCP messages, and application messages:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An OCP agent may communicate with multiple OCP agents.  This is
      outside the scope of this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An OPES processor may have multiple concurrent OCP connections to
      a callout server.  Communication over multiple OCP connections is
      outside the scope of this specification.
   o  A connection may carry multiple concurrent transactions.  A
      transaction is always associated with a single connection (i.e., a
      transaction cannot span multiple concurrent connections).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A connection may carry at most one message at a time, including
      control messages and transaction-related messages.  A message is
      always associated with a single connection (i.e., a message cannot
      span multiple concurrent connections).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A transaction is a sequence of messages related to application of
      a given set of callout services to a single application message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A sequence of transaction messages from an OPES processor to a
      callout server is called original flow.  A sequence of transaction
      messages from a callout server to an OPES processor is called
      adapted flow.  The two flows may overlap in time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  In OCP Core, a transaction is associated with a single original
      and a single adapted application message.  OCP Core extensions may
      extend transaction scope to more application messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An application message (adapted or original) is transferred by
      using a sequence of OCP messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.7"><h3>2.7   Timeouts</h3></a>

   OCP violations, resource limits, external dependencies, and other
   factors may lead to states in which an OCP agent is not receiving
   required messages from the other OCP agent.  OCP Core defines no
   messages to address such situations.  In the absence of any extension
   mechanism, OCP agents must implement timeouts for OCP operations.  An
   OCP agent MUST forcefully terminate any OCP connection, negotiation,
   transaction, etc.  that is not making progress.  This rule covers
   both dead- and livelock situations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In their implementation, OCP agents MAY rely on transport-level or
   other external timeouts if such external timeouts are guaranteed to
   happen for a given OCP operation.  Depending on the OCP operation, an
   agent may benefit from "pinging" the other side with a Progress Query
   (PQ) message before terminating an OCP transaction or connection.
   The latter is especially useful for adaptations that may take a long
   time at the callout server before producing any adapted data.
	<a name="section-2.8"><h3>2.8   Environment</h3></a>

   OCP communication is assumed usually to take place over TCP/IP
   connections on the Internet (though no default TCP port is assigned
   to OCP in this specification).  This does not preclude OCP from being
   implemented on top of other transport protocols, or on other
   networks.  High-level transport protocols such as BEEP [RFC3080] may
   be used.  OCP Core requires a reliable and message-order-preserving
   transport.  Any protocol with these properties can be used; the
   mapping of OCP message structures onto the transport data units of
   the protocol in question is outside the scope of this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP Core is application agnostic.  OCP messages can carry
   application-specific information as a payload or as
   application-specific message parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP Core overhead in terms of extra traffic on the wire is about 100
   - 200 octets per small application message.  Pipelining, preview,
   data preservation, and early termination optimizations, as well as
   as-is encapsulation of application data, make fast exchange of
   application messages possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Messages</h2></a>

   As defined in section 1.3, an OCP message is a basic unit of
   communication between an OPES processor and a callout server.  A
   message is a sequence of octets formatted according to syntax rules
   (section 3.1).  Message semantics is defined in section 11.  Messages
   are transmitted on top of OCP transport.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP messages deal with transport, transaction management, and
   application data exchange between a single OPES processor and a
   single callout server.  Some messages can be emitted only by an OPES
   processor; some only by a callout server; and some by both OPES
   processor and callout server.  Some messages require responses (one
   could call such messages "requests"); some can only be used in
   response to other messages ("responses"); some may be sent without
   solicitation; and some may not require a response.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Message Format</h3></a>

   An OCP message consists of a message name followed by optional
   parameters and a payload.  The exact message syntax is defined by the
   following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC2234]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   message = name [SP anonym-parameters]
             [CRLF named-parameters CRLF]
             [CRLF payload CRLF]
             ";" CRLF

   anonym-parameters = value *(SP value)               ; space-separated
   named-parameters  = named-value *(CRLF named-value) ; CRLF-separated
   list-items        = value *("," value)              ; comma-separated

   payload = data

   named-value = name ":" SP value

   value     = structure / list / atom
   structure = "{" [anonym-parameters] [CRLF named-parameters CRLF] "}"
   list      = "(" [ list-items ] ")"
   atom      = bare-value / quoted-value

   name = ALPHA *safe-OCTET
   bare-value = 1*safe-OCTET
   quoted-value = DQUOTE data DQUOTE
   data = size ":" *OCTET                   ; exactly size octets

   safe-OCTET = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
   size = dec-number                        ; 0-2147483647
   dec-number = 1*DIGIT                     ; no leading zeros or signs

   Several normative rules accompany the above ABNF:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  There is no "implied linear space" (LWS) rule.  LWS rules are
      common to MIME-based grammars but are not used here.  The
      whitespace syntax is restricted to what is explicitly allowed by
      the above ABNF.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  All protocol elements are case sensitive unless it is specified
      otherwise.  In particular, message names and parameter names are
      case sensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Sizes are interpreted as decimal values and cannot have leading
      zeros.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Sizes do not exceed 2147483647.
   o  The size attribute in a quoted-value encoding specifies the exact
      number of octets following the column (':') separator.  If size
      octets are not followed by a quote ('"') character, the encoding
      is syntactically invalid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Empty quoted values are encoded as a 4-octet sequence "0:".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Any bare value can be encoded as a quoted value.  A quoted value
      is interpreted after the encoding is removed.  For example, number
      1234 can be encoded as four octets 1234 or as eight octets
      "4:1234", yielding exactly the same meaning.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Unicode UTF-8 is the default encoding.  Note that ASCII is a UTF-8
      subset, and that the syntax prohibits non-ASCII characters outside
      of the "data" element.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Messages violating formatting rules are, by definition, invalid.  See
   section 5 for rules governing processing of invalid messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Message Rendering</h3></a>

   OCP message samples in this specification and its extensions may not
   be typeset to depict minor syntactical details of OCP message format.
   Specifically, SP and CRLF characters are not shown explicitly.  No
   rendering of an OCP message can be used to infer message format.  The
   message format definition above is the only normative source for all
   implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On occasion, an OCP message line exceeds text width allowed by this
   specification format.  A backslash ("\"), a "soft line break"
   character, is used to emphasize a protocol-violating
   presentation-only linebreak.  Bare backslashes are prohibited by OCP
   syntax.  Similarly, an "\r\n" string is sometimes used to emphasize
   the presence of a CRLF sequence, usually before OCP message payload.
   Normally, the visible end of line corresponds to the CRLF sequence on
   the wire.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The next section (section 3.3) contains specific OCP message
   examples, some of which illustrate the above rendering techniques.
	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Message Examples</h3></a>

   OCP syntax provides for compact representation of short control
   messages and required parameters while allowing for parameter
   extensions.  Below are examples of short control messages.  The
   required CRLF sequence at the end of each line is not shown
   explicitly (see section 3.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PQ;
   TS 1 2;

   DWP 22 16;
   x-doit "5:xyzzy";

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above examples contain atomic anonymous parameter values, such as
   number and string constants.  OCP messages sometimes use more
   complicated parameters such as item lists or structures with named
   values.  As both messages below illustrate, structures and lists can
   be nested:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NO ({"32:http://www.iana.org/assignments/opes/ocp/tls"});

   Transfer-Encodings: (chunked)
   });

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Optional parameters and extensions are possible with a named
   parameters approach, as illustrated by the following example.  The
   DWM (section 11.17) message in the example has two anonymous
   parameters (the last one being an extension) and two named parameters
   (the last one being an extension).

	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Message Names</h3></a>

   Most OCP messages defined in this specification have short names,
   formed by abbreviating or compressing a longer but human-friendlier
   message title.  Short names without a central registration system
   (such as this specification or the IANA registry) are likely to cause
   conflicts.  Informal protocol extensions should avoid short names.
   To emphasize what is already defined by message syntax,
   implementations cannot assume that all message names are very short.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Transactions</h2></a>

   An OCP transaction is a logical sequence of OCP messages processing a
   single original application message.  The result of the processing

   may be zero or more application messages, adapted from the original.
   A typical transaction consists of two message flows: a flow from the
   OPES processor to the callout server (sending the original
   application message), and a flow from the callout server to the OPES
   processor (sending adapted application messages).  The number of
   application messages produced by the callout server and whether the
   callout server actually modifies the original application message may
   depend on the requested callout service and other factors.  The OPES
   processor or the callout server can terminate the transaction by
   sending a corresponding message to the other side.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An OCP transaction starts with a Transaction Start (TS) message sent
   by the OPES processor.  A transaction ends with the first Transaction
   End (TE) message sent or received, explicit or implied.  A TE message
   can be sent by either side.  Zero or more OCP messages associated
   with the transaction can be exchanged in between.  The figure below
   illustrates a possible message sequence (prefix "P" stands for the
   OPES processor; prefix "S" stands for the callout server).  Some
   message details are omitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   P: TS 10;

   S: AME 10 2 result;
   P: TE 10 result;
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Invalid Input</h2></a>

   This specification contains many criteria for valid OCP messages and
   their parts, including syntax rules, semantics requirements, and
   relationship to agents state.  In this context, "Invalid input" means
   messages or message parts that violate at least one of the normative
   rules.  A message with an invalid part is, by definition, invalid.
   If OCP agent resources are exhausted while parsing or interpreting a
   message, the agent MUST treat the corresponding OCP message as
   invalid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unless explicitly allowed to do otherwise, an OCP agent MUST
   terminate the transaction if it receives an invalid message with
   transaction scope and MUST terminate the connection if it receives an
   invalid message with a connection scope.  A terminating agent MUST
   use the result status code of 400 and MAY specify termination cause
   information in the result status reason parameter (see section
   10.10).  If an OCP agent is unable to determine the scope of an
   invalid message it received, the agent MUST treat the message as
   having connection scope.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP usually deals with optional but invasive application message
   manipulations for which correctness ought to be valued above
   robustness.  For example, a failure to insert or remove certain
   optional web page content is usually far less disturbing than
   corrupting (making unusable) the host page while performing that
   insertion or removal.  Most OPES adaptations are high level in
   nature, which makes it impossible to assess correctness of the
   adaptations automatically, especially if "robustness guesses" are
   involved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Negotiation</h2></a>

   The negotiation mechanism allows OCP agents to agree on the mutually
   acceptable set of features, including optional and
   application-specific behavior and OCP extensions.  For example,
   transport encryption, data format, and support for a new message can
   be negotiated.  Negotiation implies intent for a behavioral change.
   For a related mechanism allowing an agent to query capabilities of
   its counterpart without changing the counterpart's behavior, see the
   Ability Query (AQ) and Ability Answer (AA) message definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Most negotiations require at least one round trip time delay.  In
   rare cases when the other side's response is not required
   immediately, negotiation delay can be eliminated, with an inherent
   risk of an overly optimistic assumption about the negotiation
   response.
   A detected violation of negotiation rules leads to OCP connection
   termination.  This design reduces the number of negotiation scenarios
   resulting in a deadlock when one of the agents is not compliant.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two core negotiation primitives are supported: negotiation offer and
   negotiation response.  A Negotiation Offer (NO) message allows an
   agent to specify a set of features from which the responder has to
   select at most one feature that it prefers.  The selection is sent by
   using a Negotiation Response (NR) message.  If the response is
   positive, both sides assume that the selected feature is in effect
   immediately (see section 11.19 for details).  If the response is
   negative, no behavioral changes are assumed.  In either case, further
   offers may follow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Negotiating OCP agents have to take into account prior negotiated
   (i.e., already enabled) features.  OCP agents MUST NOT make and MUST
   reject offers that would lead to a conflict with already negotiated
   features.  For example, an agent cannot offer an HTTP application
   profile for a connection that already has an SMTP application profile
   enabled, as there would be no way to resolve the conflict for a given
   transaction.  Similarly, once TLSv1 connection encryption is
   negotiated, an agent must not offer and must reject offers for SSLv2
   connection encryption (unless a negotiated feature explicitly allows
   for changing an encryption scheme on the fly).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Negotiation Offer (NO) messages may be sent by either agent.  OCP
   extensions documenting negotiation MAY assign the initiator role to
   one of the agents, depending on the feature being negotiated.  For
   example, negotiation of transport security feature should be
   initiated by OPES processors to avoid situations where both agents
   wait for the other to make an offer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As either agent may make an offer, two "concurrent" offers may be
   made at the same time, by the two communicating agents.  Unmanaged
   concurrent offers may lead to a negotiation deadlock.  By giving OPES
   processor a priority, offer-handling rules (section 11.18) ensure
   that only one offer per OCP connection is honored at a time, and that
   the other concurrent offers are ignored by both agents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Negotiation Phase</h3></a>

   A Negotiation Phase is a mechanism ensuring that both agents have a
   chance to negotiate all features they require before proceeding
   further.  Negotiation Phases have OCP connection scope and do not
   overlap.  For each OCP agent, the Negotiation Phase starts with the
   first Negotiation Offer (NO) message received or the first
   Negotiation Response (NR) message sent, provided the message is not a
   part of an existing Phase.  For each OCP agent, Negotiation Phase
   ends with the first Negotiation Response (NR) message (sent or
   received), after which the agent expects no more negotiations.  Agent
   expectation rules are defined later in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   During a Negotiation Phase, an OCP agent MUST NOT send messages other
   than the following "Negotiation Phase messages": Negotiation Offer
   (NO), Negotiation Response (NR), Ability Query (AQ), Ability Answer
   (AA), Progress Query (PQ), Progress Answer (PA), Progress Report
   (PR), and Connection End (CE).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Multiple Negotiation Phases may happen during the lifespan of a
   single OCP connection.  An agent may attempt to start a new
   Negotiation Phase immediately after the old Phase is over, but it is
   possible that the other agent will send messages other than
   "Negotiation Phase messages" before receiving the new Negotiation
   Offer (NO).  The agent that starts a Phase has to be prepared to
   handle those messages while its offer is reaching the recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An OPES processor MUST make a negotiation offer immediately after
   sending a Connection Start (CS) message.  If the OPES processor has
   nothing to negotiate, the processor MUST send a Negotiation Offer
   (NO) message with an empty features list.  These two rules bootstrap
   the first Negotiation Phase.  Agents are expected to negotiate at
   least the application profile for OCP Core.  Thus, these
   bootstrapping requirements are unlikely to result in any extra work.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once a Negotiation Phase starts, an agent MUST expect further
   negotiations if and only if the last NO sent or the last NR received
   contained a true "Offer-Pending" parameter value.  Informally, an
   agent can keep the phase open by sending true "Offer-Pending"
   parameters with negotiation offers or responses.  Moreover, if there
   is a possibility that the agent may need to continue the Negotiation
   Phase, the agent must send a true "Offer-Pending" parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Negotiation Examples</h3></a>

   Below is an example of the simplest negotiation possible.  The OPES
   processor is offering nothing and is predictably receiving a
   rejection.  Note that the NR message terminates the Negotiation Phase
   in this case because neither of the messages contains a true
   "Offer-Pending" value:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   P: NO ();
   S: NR;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The next example illustrates how a callout server can force
   negotiation of a feature that an OPES processor has not negotiated.
   Note that the server sets the "Offer-Pending" parameter to true when
   responding to the processor Negotiation Offer (NO) message.  The
   processor chooses to accept the feature:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   P: NO ();
   S: NR
      Offer-Pending: true
      ;
   S: NO ({"22:ocp://feature/example/"})
      Offer-Pending: false
      ;
   P: NR {"22:ocp://feature/example/"};

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the server seeks to stop the above negotiations after sending a
   true "Offer-Pending" value, its only option would be send an empty
   negotiation offer (see the first example above).  If the server does
   nothing instead, the OPES processor would wait for the server and
   would eventually time out the connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following example shows a dialog with a callout server that
   insists on enabling two imaginary features: strong transport
   encryption and volatile storage for responses.  The server is
   designed not to exchange sensitive messages until both features are
   enabled.  Naturally, the volatile storage feature has to be
   negotiated securely.  The OPES processor supports one of the strong
   encryption mechanisms but prefers not to offer (to volunteer support
   for) strong encryption, perhaps for performance reasons.  The server
   has to send a true "Offer-Pending" parameter to get a chance to offer
   strong encryption (which is successfully negotiated in this case).
   Any messages sent by either agent after the (only) successful NR
   response are encrypted with "strongB" encryption scheme.  The OPES
   processor does not understand the volatile storage feature, and the
   last negotiation fails (over a strongly encrypted transport
   connection).

   Many adaptations do not require any data modifications (e.g., message
   logging or blocking).  Some adaptations modify only a small portion
   of application message content (e.g., HTTP cookies filtering or ad
   insertion).  Yet, in many cases, the callout service has to see
   complete data.  By default, unmodified data would first travel from
   the OPES processor to the callout server and then back.  The "data
   preservation" optimization in OCP helps eliminate the return trip if
   both OCP agents cooperate.  Such cooperation is optional: OCP agents
   MAY support data preservation optimization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To avoid sending back unmodified data, a callout service has to know
   that the OPES processor has a copy of the data.  As data sizes can be
   very large and the callout service may not know in advance whether it
   will be able to use the processor copy, it is not possible to require
   the processor to keep a copy of the entire original data.  Instead,
   it is expected that a processor may keep some portion of the data,
   depending on processor settings and state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an OPES processor commits to keeping a data chunk, it announces
   its decision and the chunk parameters via a Kept parameter of a Data
   Use Mine (DUM) message.  The callout server MAY "use" the chunk by
   sending a Data Use Yours (DUY) message referring to the preserved
   chunk.  That OCP message does not have payload and, therefore, the
   return trip is eliminated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As the mapping between original and adapted data is not known to the
   processor, the processor MUST keep the announced-as-preserved chunk
   until the end of the corresponding transaction, unless the callout
   server explicitly tells the processor that the chunk is not needed.
   As implied by the above requirement, the processor cannot assume that
   a data chunk is no longer needed just because the callout server sent
   a Data Use Yours (DUY) message or adapted data with, for instance,
   the same offset as the preserved chunk.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For simplicity, preserved data is always a contiguous chunk of
   original data, described by an (offset, size) pair using a "Kept"
   parameter of a Data Use Mine (DUM) message.  An OPES processor may
   volunteer to increase the size of the kept data.  An OPES processor
   may increase the offset if the callout server indicated that the kept
   data is no longer needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both agents may benefit from data reuse.  An OPES processor has to
   allocate storage to support this optimization, but a callout server
   does not.  On the other hand, it is the callout server that is
   responsible for relieving the processor from data preservation
   commitments.  There is no simple way to resolve this conflict of
   interest on a protocol level.  Some OPES processors may allocate a
   relatively small buffer for data preservation purposes and stop
   preserving data when the buffer becomes full.  This technique would
   benefit callout services that can quickly reuse or discard kept data.
   Another processor strategy would be to size the buffer based on
   historical data reuse statistics.  To improve chances of beneficial
   cooperation, callout servers are strongly encouraged to immediately
   notify OPES processors of unwanted data.  The callout server that
   made a decision not to send Data Use Yours (DUY) messages (for a
   specific data ranges or at all) SHOULD immediately inform the OPES
   processor of that decision with the corresponding Data Preservation
   Interest (DPI) message(s) or other mechanisms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   'Premature Dataflow Termination' Optimizations</h2></a>

   Many callout services adapt small portions of large messages and
   would preferably not to be in the loop when that adaptation is over.
   Some callout services may not seek data modification and would
   preferably not send data back to the OPES processor, even if the OPES
   processor is not supporting the data preservation optimization
   (Section 7).  By OCP design, unilateral premature dataflow
   termination by a callout server would lead to termination of an OCP
   transaction with an error.  Thus, the two agents must cooperate to
   allow for error-free premature termination.
   This section documents two mechanisms for premature termination of
   original or adapted dataflow.  In combination, the mechanisms allow
   the callout server to get out of the processing loop altogether.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.1"><h3>8.1   Original Dataflow</h3></a>

   There are scenarios where a callout server is not interested in the
   remaining original dataflow.  For example, a simple access blocking
   or "this site is temporary down" callout service has to send an
   adapted (generated) application message but would preferably not
   receive original data from the OPES processor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP Core supports premature original dataflow termination via the
   Want Stop Receiving Data (DWSR) message.  A callout server that does
   not seek to receive additional original data (beyond a certain size)
   sends a DWSR message.  The OPES processor receiving a DWSR message
   terminates original dataflow by sending an Application Message End
   (AME) message with a 206 (partial) status code.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following figure illustrates a typical sequence of events.  The

                        <AME

   The mechanism described in this section has no effect on the adapted
   dataflow.  Receiving an Application Message End (AME) message with
   206 (partial) result status code from the OPES processor does not
   introduce any special requirements for the adapted dataflow
   termination.  However, it is not possible to terminate adapted
   dataflow prematurely after the original dataflow has been prematurely
   terminated (see section 8.3).
	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   Adapted Dataflow</h3></a>

   There are scenarios where a callout service may want to stop sending
   adapted data before a complete application message has been sent.
   For example, a logging-only callout service has to receive all
   application messages but would preferably not send copies back to the
   OPES processor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP Core supports premature adapted dataflow termination via a
   combination of Want Stop Sending Data (DWSS) and Stop Sending Data
   (DSS) messages.  A callout service that seeks to stop sending data
   sends a DWSS message, soliciting an OPES processor permission to
   stop.  While waiting for the permission, the server continues with
   its usual routine.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An OPES processor receiving a Want Stop Sending Data message responds
   with a Stop Sending Data (DSS) message.  The processor may then pause
   to wait for the callout server to terminate the adapted dataflow or

   the server terminates the adapted dataflow, the processor is

   DSS) instead of the adapted data.

   Premature adapted dataflow preservation is not trivial, as the OPES
   processor relies on the callout server to provide adapted data
   (modified or not) to construct the adapted application message.  If
   the callout server seeks to quit its job, special care must be taken
   to ensure that the OPES processor can construct the complete
   application message.  On a logical level, this mechanism is
   equivalent to switching from one callout server to another
   (non-modifying) callout server in the middle of an OCP transaction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other than a possible pause in the original dataflow, the mechanism

   Receiving an Application Message End (AME) message with 206 (partial)

   special requirements for the original dataflow termination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.3"><h3>8.3   Getting Out of the Loop</h3></a>

   Some adaptation services work on application message prefixes and do
   not seek to be in the adaptation loop once their work is done.  For
   example, an ad insertion service that did its job by modifying the
   first fragment of a web "page" would not seek to receive more
   original data or to perform further adaptations.  The 'Getting Out of
   the Loop' optimization allows a callout server to get completely out
   of the application message processing loop.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "Getting Out of the Loop" optimization is made possible by
   terminating the adapted dataflow (section 8.2) and then by
   terminating the original dataflow (section 8.1).  The order of
   termination is very important.
   If the original dataflow is terminated first, the OPES processor
   would not allow the adapted dataflow to be terminated prematurely, as
   the processor would not be able to reconstruct the remaining portion
   of the adapted application message.  The processor would not know
   which suffix of the remaining original data has to follow the adapted
   parts.  The mapping between original and adapted octets is known only
   to the callout service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An OPES processor that received a DWSS message followed by a DWSR
   message MUST NOT send an AME message with a 206 (partial) status code
   before sending a DSS message.  Informally, this rule means that a
   callout server that wants to get out of the loop fast should send a
   DWSS message immediately followed by a DWSR message; the server does
   not have to wait for the OPES processor's permission to terminate
   adapted dataflow before requesting that the OPES processor terminates
   original dataflow.

   parameters to the left are present.  The following notation

   When an anonymous parameter is added to a structure or message that

   Several parameter types, such as offset apply to both original and

   dataflow affiliation, especially when parameters with different
   affiliations are mixed together in one message declaration.  The
   following statements declare new dataflow-specific types by using
   their dataflow-agnostic versions (denoted by a <type> placeholder).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP Core uses the above type-naming scheme to implement dataflow
   specialization for the following types: offset, size, and sg-id.  OCP
   extensions SHOULD use the same scheme.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   Message Definitions</h2></a>

   This section describes specific OCP messages.  Each message is given
   a unique name and usually has a set of anonymous and/or named
   parameters.  The order of anonymous parameters is specified in the
   message definitions below.  No particular order for named parameters
   is implied by this specification.  OCP extensions MUST NOT introduce
   order-dependent named parameters.  No more than one named-parameter
   with a given name can appear in the message; messages with multiple
   equally named parameters are semantically invalid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A recipient MUST be able to parse any message in valid format (see
   section 3.1), subject to the limitations of the recipient's
   resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unknown or unexpected message names, parameters, and payloads may be
   valid extensions.  For example, an "extra" named parameter may be
   used for a given message, in addition to what is documented in the
   message definition below.  A recipient MUST ignore any valid but
   unknown or unexpected name, parameter, member, or payload.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some message parameter values use uni identifiers to refer to various
   OCP states (see section 10.2 and Appendix B).  These identifiers are
   created, used, and destroyed by OCP agents via corresponding
   messages.  Except when creating a new identifier, an OCP agent MUST
   NOT send a uni identifier that corresponds to an inactive state
   (i.e., that was either never created or already destroyed).  Such
   identifiers invalidate the host OCP message (see section 5).  For
   example, the recipient must terminate the transaction when the xid
   parameter in a Data Use Mine (DUM) message refers to an unknown or
   already terminated OCP transaction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.1"><h3>11.1   Connection Start (CS)</h3></a>

   CS: extends message;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Connection Start (CS) message indicates the start of an OCP
   connection.  An OCP agent MUST send this message before it sends any
   other message on the connection.  If the first message an OCP agent
   receives is not Connection Start (CS), the agent MUST terminate the
   connection with a Connection End (CE) message having 400 (failure)
   result status code.  An OCP agent MUST send Connection Start (CS)
   message exactly once.  An OCP agent MUST ignore repeated Connection
   Start (CS) messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At any time, a callout server MAY refuse further processing on an OCP
   connection by sending a Connection End (CE) message with the status
   code 400 (failure).  Note that the above requirement to send a CS
   message first still applies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With TCP/IP as transport, raw TCP connections (local and remote peer
   IP addresses with port numbers) identify an OCP connection.  Other
   transports may provide OCP connection identifiers to distinguish
   logical connections that share the same transport.  For example, a
   single BEEP [RFC3080] channel may be designated as a single OCP
   connection.

   CE: extends message with {
           [result];
   };

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Connection End (CE) Indicates the end of an OCP connection.  The
   agent initiating closing or termination of a connection MUST send
   this message immediately prior to closing or termination.  The
   recipient MUST free associated state, including transport state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Connection termination without a Connection End (CE) message
   indicates that the connection was prematurely closed, possibly
   without the closing-side agent's prior knowledge or intent.  When an
   OCP agent detects a prematurely closed connection, the agent MUST act
   as if a Connection End (CE) message indicating a failure was
   received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Connection End (CE) message implies the end of all transactions,
   negotiations, and service groups opened or active on the connection
   being ended.

   SGC: extends message with {
           my-sg-id services;
   };

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A Service Group Created (SGC) message informs the recipient that a
   list of adaptation services has been associated with the given
   service group identifier ("my-sg-id").  Following this message, the
   sender can refer to the group by using the identifier.  The recipient
   MUST maintain the association until a matching Service Group
   Destroyed (SGD) message is received or the corresponding OCP
   connection is closed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Service groups have a connection scope.  Transaction management
   messages do not affect existing service groups.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Maintaining service group associations requires resources (e.g.,
   storage to keep the group identifier and a list of service IDs).
   Thus, there is a finite number of associations an implementation can
   maintain.  Callout servers MUST be able to maintain at least one
   association for each OCP connection they accept.  If a recipient of a
   Service Group Created (SGC) message does not create the requested
   association, it MUST immediately terminate the connection with a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an AMS message is sent by the OPES processor, the callout server
   usually sends an AMS message back, announcing the creation of an

   wait for more information from the OPES processor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an AMS message is sent by the callout server, an optional
   "Services" parameter describes OPES services that the server MAY
   apply to the original application message.  Usually, the "services"
   value matches what was asked by the OPES processor.  The callout
   server SHOULD send a "Services" parameter if its value would differ
   from the list of services requested by the OPES processor.  As the

   Yours (DUY) messages (i.e., the my-offset of the next data message
   must be equal to the my-offset plus the payload size of the previous
   data message).  Messages with gaps are invalid.  The sender MUST send
   payload and MAY use empty payload (i.e., payload with zero size).  A
   DUM message without payload is invalid.  Empty payloads are useful
   for communicating meta-information about the data (e.g., modification
   predictions or preservation commitments) without sending data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An OPES processor MAY send a "Kept" parameter to indicate its current
   data preservation commitment (section 7) for original data.  When an
   OPES processor sends a "Kept" parameter, the processor MUST keep a
   copy of the specified data (the preservation commitment starts or
   continues).  The Kept offset parameter specifies the offset of the
   first octet of the preserved data.  The Kept size parameter is the
   size of preserved data.  Note that data preservation rules allow
   (i.e., do not prohibit) an OPES processor to decrease offset and to
   specify a data range not yet fully delivered to the callout server.
   OCP Core does not require any relationship between DUM payload and
   the "Kept" parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the "Kept" parameter value violates data preservation rules but
   the recipient has not sent any Data Use Yours (DUY) messages for the
   given OCP transaction yet, then the recipient MUST NOT use any
   preserved data for the given transaction (i.e., must not sent any
   Data Use Yours (DUY) messages).  If the "Kept" parameter value
   violates data preservation rules and the recipient has already sent
   Data Use Yours (DUY) messages, the DUM message is invalid, and the
   rules of section 5 apply.  These requirements help preserve data
   integrity when "Kept" optimization is used by the OPES processor.
   A callout server MUST send a "Modp" parameter if the server can
   provide a reliable value and has not already sent the same parameter
   value for the corresponding application message.  The definition of
   "reliable" is entirely up to the callout server.  The data
   modification prediction includes DUM payload.  That is, if the
   attached payload has been modified, the modp value cannot be 0%.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A callout server SHOULD send an "As-is" parameter if the attached
   data is identical to a fragment at the specified offset in the
   original dataflow.  An "As-is" parameter specifying a data fragment
   that has not been sent to the callout server is invalid.  The
   recipient MUST ignore invalid "As-is" parameters.  Identical means
   that all adapted octets have the same numeric value as the
   corresponding original octets.  This parameter is meant to allow for
   partial data preservation optimizations without a preservation
   commitment.  The preserved data still crosses the connection with the
   callout server twice, but the OPES processor may be able to optimize
   its handling of the data.

   that use the specified service group ID.  Connection-scoped features
   are negotiated and enabled for all service groups.  The presence of
   scope does not imply automatic conflict resolution common to
   programming languages; no conflicts are allowed.  When negotiating
   connection-scoped features, an agent MUST check for conflicts within
   each existing service group.  When negotiating group-scoped features,
   an agent MUST check for conflicts with connection-scoped features
   already negotiated.  For example, it must not be possible to
   negotiate a connection-scoped HTTP application profile if one service
   group already has an SMTP application profile, and vice versa.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP agents SHOULD NOT send offers with service groups used by pending
   transactions.  Unless it is explicitly noted otherwise in a feature

   transactions.  In other words, negotiated features take effect with
   the new OCP transaction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As with other protocol elements, OCP Core extensions may document
   additional negotiation restrictions.  For example, specification of a

   does not match any of the offered features, the offering agent MUST
   consider negotiation failed and MAY terminate the connection with a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PA message carries the sender's state.  The "Org-Data" size is the
   total original data size received or sent by the agent so far for the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The progress inquiry interface is useful for several purposes,
   including keeping idle OCP connections "alive", gauging the agent
   processing speed, verifying the agent's progress, and debugging OCP

   implement timeouts for callout servers that do not send any adapted
   data until the entire original application message is received and
   processed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A recipient of a PA message MUST NOT assume that the sender is not
   working on any transaction or application message not identified in
   the PA message.  A PA message does not carry information about
   multiple transactions or application messages.
   If an agent is working on the transaction identified in the Progress
   Query (PQ) request, the agent MUST send the corresponding transaction
   ID (xid) when answering the PQ with a PA message.  Otherwise, the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-13"><h2>13.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This section examines security considerations for OCP.  OPES threats
   are documented in [RFC3837]
   OCP relays application messages that may contain sensitive
   information.  Appropriate transport encryption can be negotiated to
   prevent information leakage or modification (see section 6), but OCP
   agents may support unencrypted transport by default.  These
   configurations will expose application messages to third-party
   recording and modification, even if OPES proxies themselves are
   secure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP implementation bugs may lead to security vulnerabilities in OCP
   agents, even if OCP traffic itself remains secure.  For example, a
   buffer overflow in a callout server caused by a malicious OPES
   processor may grant that processor access to information from other
   (100% secure) OCP connections, including connections with other OPES
   processors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Careless OCP implementations may rely on various OCP identifiers to
   be unique across all OCP agents.  A malicious agent can inject an OCP
   message that matches identifiers used by other agents, in an attempt
   to gain access to sensitive data.  OCP implementations must always
   check an identifier for being "local" to the corresponding connection
   before using that identifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP is a stateful protocol.  Several OCP commands increase the amount
   of state that the recipient has to maintain.  For example, a Service
   Group Created (SGC) message instructs the recipient to maintain an
   association between a service group identifier and a list of
   services.

   This specification defines compliance for the following compliance
   subjects:  OPES processors (OCP client implementations), callout
   servers (OCP server implementations), and OCP extensions.  An OCP
   agent (a processor or callout server) may also be referred to as the
   "sender" or "recipient" of an OCP message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A compliance subject is compliant if it satisfies all applicable
   "MUST" and "SHOULD" requirements.  By definition, to satisfy a "MUST"
   requirement means to act as prescribed by the requirement; to satisfy
   a "SHOULD" requirement means either to act as prescribed by the
   requirement or to have a reason to act differently.  A requirement is
   applicable to the subject if it instructs (addresses) the subject.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Informally, OCP compliance means that there are no known "MUST"
   violations, and that all "SHOULD" violations are deliberate.  In
   other words, "SHOULD" means "MUST satisfy or MUST have a reason to
   violate".  It is expected that compliance claims be accompanied by a
   list of unsupported SHOULDs (if any), in an appropriate format,
   explaining why the preferred behavior was not chosen.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Only normative parts of this specification affect compliance.
   Normative parts are those parts explicitly marked with the word
   "normative", definitions, and phrases containing unquoted capitalized
   keywords from [RFC2119].  Consequently, examples and illustrations
   are not normative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-15.1"><h3>15.1   Extending OCP Core</h3></a>

   OCP extensions MUST NOT change the OCP Core message format, as
   defined by ABNF and accompanying normative rules in Section 3.1.
   This requirement is intended to allow OCP message viewers,
   validators, and "intermediary" software to at least isolate and
   decompose any OCP message, even a message with semantics unknown to
   them (i.e., extended).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OCP extensions are allowed to change normative OCP Core requirements
   for OPES processors and callout servers.  However, OCP extensions
   SHOULD NOT make these changes and MUST require on a "MUST"-level that
   these changes are negotiated prior to taking effect.  Informally,
   this specification defines compliant OCP agent behavior until changes
   to this specification (if any) are successfully negotiated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, if an RTSP profile for OCP requires support for offsets
   exceeding 2147483647 octets, the profile specification can document
   appropriate OCP changes while requiring that RTSP adaptation agents
   negotiate "large offsets" support before using large offsets.  This
   negotiation can be bundled with negotiating another feature (e.g.,
   negotiating an RTSP profile may imply support for "large offsets").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As implied by the above rules, OCP extensions may dynamically alter
   the negotiation mechanism itself, but such an alternation would have
   to be negotiated first, using the negotiation mechanism defined by
   this specification.  For example, successfully negotiating a feature
   might change the default "Offer-Pending" value from false to true.
