       Allocation of a Generic Associated Channel Type for ITU-T
   MPLS Transport Profile Operation, Maintenance, and Administration
                             (MPLS-TP OAM)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document assigns a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type for
   carrying ITU-T MPLS Transport Profile Operations, Administration, and
   Management (MPLS-TP OAM) messages in the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) defined in [RFC5654] is a
   profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport networks.  The
   MPLS-TP profile includes a set of Operations, Administration, and
   Management (OAM) tools defined by the IETF [RFC6669] that are used to
   meet the OAM functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1] documents MPLS-TP OAM.  This
   Recommendation builds upon Ethernet OAM as documented in [Y.1731].
   The messages in [G.8113.1] are defined to be carried in a new Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type in the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.  In order to carry these messages in an interoperable
   fashion, a Generic Associated Channel Type from the IANA maintained
   registry "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" is to be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To fulfill the request from ITU-T SG15 in [LS370] and to allow
   deployment of the [G.8113.1] OAM solution without using an
   experimental G-ACh Type, IANA has assigned a G-ACh Type <0x8902> for
   use by the ITU-T for [G.8113.1].  This G-ACh Type is known as the
   "G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A number of experts in the IETF do not consider that the development
   or deployment of a second protocol solution within the same
   architectural problem space is necessary or advisable [RFC6670].
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Requirements Notation</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type</h2></a>

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST only be used for OAM
   messages, as defined in the ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1], carried
   in the G-ACh.  The OAM messages and procedures carried behind this
   G-ACh Type are restricted to only those that address the OAM
   functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].  Other message types
   MUST NOT be carried behind this G-ACh Type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All ITU-T Recommendations are subject to updates by errata,
   corrigenda, amendments, or complete revisions.  In any update of
   [G.8113.1], the G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST NOT be used
   for any functions not identified as OAM functional requirements in
   [RFC5860].  An update of [G.8113.1] may use the G-ACh Type assigned
   by this document to support the OAM functions identified in
   [RFC5860].  When an amendment or complete revision of G.8113.1 is
   approved, the reference to [G.8113.1], provided in this document,
   should be updated to show the approval date of the new version.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document may be used on any transport
   construct that uses the G-ACh, e.g., MPLS-TP Sections, MPLS-TP LSPs,
   or PWs as described in [G.8113.1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   As noted in [RFC5586], when new G-ACh Types are defined, the
   "security considerations MUST be described in the relevant associated
   channel type specification".  The IETF takes this opportunity to
   remind the ITU-T of the need to describe security considerations in
   [G.8113.1].
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA maintains the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" sub-registry
   of the "Pseudowire Name Spaces (PWE3)" registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IANA has allocated a new G-ACh Type as follows:
