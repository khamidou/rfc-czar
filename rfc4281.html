</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   Several MIME type/subtype combinations exist that can contain
   different media formats.  A receiving agent thus needs to examine the
   details of such media content to determine if the specific elements
   can be rendered given an available set of codecs.  Especially when
   the end system has limited resources, or the connection to the end
   system has limited bandwidth, it would be helpful to know from the
   Content-Type alone if the content can be rendered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document adds a new parameter, "codecs", to various type/subtype
   combinations to allow for unambiguous specification of the codecs
   indicated by the media formats contained within.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   By labeling content with the specific codecs indicated to render the
   contained media, receiving systems can determine if the codecs are
   supported by the end system, and if not, can take appropriate action
   (such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the
   situation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and
   installing the required codecs, further inspection to determine if it
   will be sufficient to support a subset of the indicated codecs, etc.)

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   One of the original motivations for MIME is the ability to identify
   the specific media type of a message part.  However, due to various
   factors, it is not always possible from looking at the MIME type and
   subtype to know which specific media formats are contained in the
   body part, or which codecs are indicated in order to render the
   content.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are several media type/subtypes (either currently registered or
   deployed with registration pending) that contain codecs chosen from a
   set.  It is currently necessary to examine each media element in
   order to determine the codecs required to render the content.  For
   example, video/3gpp may contain any of the video formats H.263
   Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264, MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or any
   of the audio formats Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR), Adaptive Multi Rate -
   WideBand (AMR-WB), Extended AMR-WB, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), or
   Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in [3GPP-Formats].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In some cases, the specific codecs can be determined by examining the
   header information of the media content.  While this isn't as bad as
   examining the entire content, it still requires specialized knowledge
   of each format and is resource consumptive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This ambiguity can be a problem for various clients and servers.  It
   presents a significant burden to Multimedia Messaging (MMS) servers,
   which must examine the media sent in each message in order to
   determine which codecs are required to render the content.  Only then
   can such a server determine if the content requires transcoding or
   specialized handling prior to being transmitted to the handset.
   Additionally, it presents a challenge to smart clients on devices
   with constrained memory, processing power, or transmission bandwidth
   (such as cellular telephones and PDAs).  Such clients often need to
   determine in advance if they are currently capable of rendering the
   content contained in an MMS or email message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Current ambiguity:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   audio/3gpp can contain AMR, AAC, AMR-WB, Extended AMR-WB, or
       Enhanced aacPlus contents as specified in [3GPP-Formats].
   o   audio/3gpp2 can contain AMR, AAC, 13K (as per [13k]), Enhanced
       Variable Rate Codec (EVRC), Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV),
       or VMR-WB, as specified in [3GPP2-Formats].
   o   video/3gpp can contain H.263 Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264,
       MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or AMR, AMR-WB, Extended AMR-WB, AAC,
       or Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in [3GPP-Formats].
   o   video/3gpp2 can contain H.263 Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264,
       MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or AMR, AAC, 13K (as per [13k]),
       EVRC, SMV, or VMR-WB, as specified in [3GPP2-Formats].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that there are additional media types that are ambiguous, but
   are outside the scope of this document, including:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   video/mpeg4-generic, which can contain anything allowed by the
       MPEG-4 specification, or any codec registered with the MP4
       registration authority [MP4-Reg];
   o   video/quicktime, which can contain anything for which there is a
       QuickTime codec component; since QuickTime is extensible, this
       is not limited to the codecs that are or have been shipped by
       Apple Computer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With each "bucket" type, a receiving agent only knows that it has a
   container format.  It doesn't even know whether content labeled
   video/3gpp or video/3gpp2 contains video; it might be audio only,
   audio and video, or video only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A solution that permits a receiving agent to determine the specific
   codecs required to render media content would help provide efficient
   and scalable servers, especially for Multimedia Messaging (MMS), and
   aid the growth of multimedia services in wireless networks.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in "Key
   words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax in this document uses the BNF rules specified in
   [MIME-Format] and [MIME-Coding].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   The Codecs Parameter</h2></a>

   This document adds a parameter to allow unambiguous specification of
   all codecs indicated to render the content in the MIME part.  This
   parameter is optional in all current types to which it is added.
   Future types that contain ambiguity are strongly encouraged to
   include this parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Media types:
       audio/3gpp,
       audio/3gpp2,
       video/3gpp,
       video/3gpp2,

   Parameter name:
       Codecs

   Parameter value:  A single value, or a comma-separated list of values
        identifying the codec(s) indicated to render the content in the
        body part.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Each value consists of one or more dot-separated elements.  The
        name space for the first element is determined by the MIME type.
        The name space for each subsequent element is determined by the
        preceding element.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note that, per [MIME-Format], some characters (including the
        comma used to separate multiple values) require that the entire
        parameter value be enclosed in quotes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        An element MAY include an octet that must be encoded in order to
        comply with [MIME-Format].  In this case, [MIME-Coding] is used:
        an asterisk ("*") is placed at the end of the parameter name
        (becoming "codecs*" instead of "codecs"), the parameter value
        usually starts with two single quote ("'") characters
        (indicating that neither character set nor language is
        specified), and each octet that requires encoding is represented
        as a percent sign ("%") followed by two hexadecimal digits.
        Note that, when the [MIME-Coding] form is used, the percent
        sign, asterisk, and single quote characters have special meaning
        and so must themselves be encoded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Examples of Generic Syntax:
            codecs=a.bb.ccc.d
            codecs="a.bb.ccc.d, e.fff"
            codecs*=''fo%2e
            codecs*="''%25%20xz, gork"

   When the Codecs parameter is used, it MUST contain all codecs
   indicated by the content present in the body part.  The Codecs
   parameter MUST NOT include any codecs that are not indicated by any
   media elements in the body part.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In some cases, not all indicated codecs are absolutely required in
   order to render the content.  Therefore, when a receiver does not
   support all listed codecs, special handling MAY be required.  For
   example, the media element(s) MAY need to be examined in order to
   determine if an unsupported codec is actually required (e.g., there
   may be alternative tracks (such as English and Spanish audio), there
   may be timed text that can be dropped, etc.)

   NOTE:  Although the parameter value MUST be complete and accurate in
   'breadth' (that is, it MUST report all four-character codes used in
   all tracks for ISO-family files, for example) systems MUST NOT rely
   on it being complete in 'depth'.  If the hierarchical rules for a
   given code (e.g., 'qvxy') were written after a server was
   implemented, for example, that server will not know what elements to
   place after 'qvxy'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a receiver encounters a body part whose Codecs parameter contains
   codecs that are not indicated by any media elements, then the
   receiver SHOULD process the body part by discarding the information
   in the Codecs parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a receiver encounters a body part whose Codecs parameter does not
   contain all codecs indicated by the media elements, then the receiver
   MAY process the body part by discarding the information in the Codecs
   parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Generic Syntax</h3></a>

   The Codecs parameter takes either of two forms.  The first form is
   used when the value does not contain any octets that require
   encoding.  The second form uses [MIME-Coding] to allow arbitrary
   octets to be encoded.  With either form, quotes allow for commas and
   other characters in <tspecials> (quotes MAY be used even when not
   required).
   This BNF uses the rules specified in [MIME-Format] and [MIME-Coding].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations MUST NOT add CFWS between the tokens except after
   ",".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   ISO File Format Name Space</h3></a>

   For the ISO Base Media File Format, the first element of a Codecs
   parameter value is a sample description entry four-character code as
   registered by the MP4 Registration Authority [MP4-Reg].  Values are
   case sensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that there are potentially multiple tracks in a file, each
   potentially carrying multiple sample entries (some but not all uses
   of the ISO File Format restrict the number of sample entries in a
   track to one).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the first element of a value is 'mp4a' (indicating some kind of
   MPEG-4 audio) or 'mp4v' (indicating some kind of MPEG-4 part-2
   video), the second element is the hexadecimal representation of the
   MP4 Registration Authority ObjectTypeIndication (OTI), as specified
   in [MP4-Reg] and [MP41] (including amendments).  Note that [MP4-Reg]
   uses a leading "0x" with these values, which is omitted here and
   hence implied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One of the OTI values for 'mp4a' is 40 (identifying MPEG-4 audio).
   For this value, the third element identifies the audio
   ObjectTypeIndication (OTI) as defined in [MP4A] (including
   amendments), expressed as a decimal number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, AAC low complexity has the value 2, so a complete

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One of the OTI values for 'mp4v' is 20 (identifying MPEG-4 part-2
   video).  For this value, the third element identifies the video
   ProfileLevelIndication as defined in [MP4V] (including amendments),
   expressed as a decimal number.

   It is sometimes helpful to provide additional details for a media

   These details are sometimes called "media features" or "media
   characteristics".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When such additional features are included, the [Content-Features]
   header provides a handy way to do so.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   The IANA has added "codecs" as an optional parameter to the media
   types listed in Section 3, with a reference to this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The Codecs parameter itself does not alter the security
   considerations of any of the media types with which it is used.  Each
   audio and video media type has its own set of security considerations
   that continue to apply, regardless of the use of the Codecs
   parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An incorrect Codecs parameter might cause media content to be
   received by a device that is not capable of rendering it, or might
   cause media content to not be sent to a device that is capable of
   receiving it.  An incorrect Codecs parameter is therefore capable of
   some types of denial-of-service attacks.  However, this is most
   likely to arise by accident, as an attacker capable of altering media
   data in transit could cause more harm by altering the media format
   itself, or even the content type header, rather than just the Codecs
   parameter of the content type header.
