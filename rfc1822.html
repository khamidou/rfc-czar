                  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Note:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This RFC is NOT a standard. It is an official public record of a
   grant by IBM Corporation for the use of a specific IBM patent in
   conjunction with the Photuris key management protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Purpose

   This Request for Comments records a grant by IBM Corporation to
   permit the conditional free use of one of its patents.  This grant is
   made to help facilitate adoption of the Internet Key Management
   Protocol contribution IBM has offered to the IETF. It should be noted
   that the confirmatory license mentioned is optional.  The grant is
   made in this RFC and parties have it even if they do not request a
   confirmation from IBM.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A Grant of Rights to Use IBM US Patent 5,148,479

   IBM hereby covenants that it will not assert its US Patent 5,148,479
   or its non-US counterparts against any party that implements Photuris
   or any derivative that includes IBM's IKMP contribution, and operates
   in compliance with Photuris or such derivative, when Photuris or such
   derivative is employed in connection with any Internet Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This grant of rights will terminate with respect to any party that
   asserts a patent it owns, directly or indirectly, against IBM for
   IBM's implementation of and operation in compliance with Photuris or
   any derivative, as defined above.  The termination will occur as of
   the date the patent is asserted against IBM.
   A written confirmation of this grant, and/or a license under any
   other IBM patent under IBM's then-current terms, conditions and
   royalty rates, can be obtained by sending a request to:
