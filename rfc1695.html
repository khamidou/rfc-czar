	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing ATM-based
   interfaces, devices, networks and services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      0    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
           for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
           management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      0    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
           managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      0    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      0    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Object Definitions</h2></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   ATM Terminology</h2></a>

   Some basic ATM terminologies are described in this section to
   facilitate defining the ATM managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   VCL/VPL and VCC/VPC</h3></a>

   There are two distinct types of ATM virtual connections: Virtual
   Channel Connections (VCCs) and Virtual Path Connection (VPCs).  As
   shown in Figures 1 and 2, ATM virtual connections consist of
   concatenated series of virtual links which forms a path between two
   end points, with each concatenation occurring at an ATM switch.
   Virtual links of VCCs are called Virtual Channel Links (VCLs).
   Virtual links of VPCs are called Virtual Path Links (VPLs). The VCI
   and VPI fields in the ATM cell header associate each cell of a VCC
   with a particular VCL over a given physical link.  The VPI field in
   the ATM cell header associates each cell of a VPC with a particular
   VPL over a given physical link.  Switches route cells between VCLs
   (or VPLs) via a cross-connect function according to the cells'
   VCI/VPI (or VPI) values.

                      Virtual Path Connection

   A single ATM end-system or switch does not support the whole end-to-
   end span of a VCC (or VPC).  Rather, multiple ATM end- systems and/or
   switches each support one piece of the VCC (or VPC).   That is, each
   ATM end-system at one end of the VCC/VPC supports its end of the
   VCC/VPC  plus the VCLs or VPLs on its external interfaces, and each
   switch through which the VCC/VPC passes, supports the multiple
   VCLs/VPLs on that switch's external interfaces and the cross-
   connection of those VCLs/VPLs through that switch.  Thus, the end-
   to-end management of a VCC or VPC is achieved only by appropriate
   management of its individual pieces in combination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that for management purposes, an ATM network may be viewed as a
   large distributed switch by hiding all the network's internal
   connectivity as being internal to the distributed switch (as shown in
   Figure 2a).  This model may for example be used for Customer Network
   Management (CNM) purposes.

   A VCC has a set of traffic characteristics (i.e., bandwidth
   parameters, QoS Class parameters, etc.).  VCLs inherit their traffic
   characteristics from the VCC of which they are a part.  VCCs are bi-
   directional by definition.  However, the traffic parameters in the
   two directions of a connection can be symmetric or asymmetric, i.e.,
   the two directions can have the same or different traffic flows.  A
   uni-directional traffic flow across a VCC is achieved by assigning a
   zero bandwidth in one direction.  Note that in addition to the
   bandwidth required by the user traffic flow, bandwidth is also
   required for OAM cell flows, even for the zero-bandwidth direction of
   a uni-directional connection.  These same principles apply to VPCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   PVC and SVC</h3></a>

   A Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) is a provisioned VCC or VPC.  A
   Switched Virtual Connection (SVC) is a switched VCC or VPC that is
   set up in real-time via call set-up signaling procedures.  A PVC (or
   an SVC) can be a point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-
   to-multipoint VCC or VPC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Traffic Management Parameters</h3></a>

	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   Traffic Policing and Traffic Shaping Parameters</h4></a>

   In order to allocate resources fairly among different users, some
   networks police traffic at resource access points.  The traffic
   enforcement or policing taken at a UNI is called Usage Parameter
   Control (UPC) and is activated on an incoming VCL or VPL as shown in
   Figure 3.  The use of the traffic enforcer at the ingress of the
   connection is to make sure that the user traffic does not exceed the
   negotiated traffic parameters such as the peak cell rate associated
   with a specific traffic descriptor type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">

                         Figure 3: An Example of a UPC

   In addition, traffic shaping may be performed on an outgoing VPL or
   VCL at a given ATM interface.  The function of the ATM traffic shaper
   either at the source or an egress point of the connection is to
   smooth the outgoing cell traffic inter-arrival time.  If policing or
   shaping is not performed then the policing or shaping algorithm is
   not activated.  ATM Forum has specified seven traffic descriptor
   types including one for the best effort traffic [9].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.2"><h4>4.3.2   Cell Loss Priority</h4></a>

   To prioritize traffic during resource congestion, ATM cells are
   assigned one of the two types of Cell Loss Priority (CLP), CLP=0 and
   CLP=1.  ATM cells with CLP=0 have a higher priority in regard to cell
   loss than ATM cells with CLP=1.  Therefore, during resource
   congestions, CLP=1 cells are dropped before any CLP=0 cell is
   dropped.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.3"><h4>4.3.3   QoS Class</h4></a>

   A VCC or VPC is associated with one of a number of Quality of Service
   (QoS) classes.  The following service classes have been specified:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Service Class A: Constant bit rate video and Circuit
                       emulation
      Service Class B: Variable bit rate video/audio
      Service Class C: Connection-oriented data
      Service Class D: Connectionless data

   Four QoS classes numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been specified with the
   aim of supporting service classes A, B, C, and D respectively.  The
   VCLs (or VPLs) concatenated to form a VCC (or VPC) will all have the
   same QoS class as that of the VCC (or VPC).  The Cell Loss Ratio
   (CLR), Cell Delay Variation (CDV), and end-to-end Cell Delay (CD)
   parameters are defined as part of QoS Class definition.  In addition,
   an unspecified QoS Class numbered 0 is specified for best effort
   traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Overview</h2></a>

   ATM management objects are used to manage ATM interfaces, ATM virtual
   links,  ATM cross-connects, AAL5 entities and AAL5 connections
   supported by ATM hosts, ATM switches and ATM networks.  This section
   provides an overview and background of how to use this MIB and other
   potential MIBs for this purpose.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The purpose of this memo is primarily to manage ATM PVCs.  ATM SVCs
   are also represented by the management information in this MIB.
   However, full management of SVCs may require additional capabilities
   which are beyond the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Background</h3></a>

   In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB modules
   are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and cross-connects.
   Examples include MIB II for general system and interface management
   (RFC 1213 and RFC 1573), the DS3 or SONET MIBs for management of
   physical interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for
   applications that make use of ATM, such as SMDS.  These MIB modules
   are outside the scope of this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The current specification of this ATM MIB is based on SNMPv2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Structure of the MIB</h3></a>

   The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following groups:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                (1) ATM interface configuration group<br>
                (2) ATM interface DS3 PLCP group<br>
                (3) ATM interface TC Sublayer group<br>
                (4) ATM interface virtual link (VPL/VCL) configuration<br>
                    groups
                (5) ATM VP/VC cross-connect groups<br>
                (6) AAL5 connection performance statistics group<br>

   Note that, managed objects for activation/deactivation of OAM cell
   flows and ATM traps notifying virtual connection or virtual link
   failures are outside the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   ATM Interface Configuration Group</h3></a>

   This group contains information on ATM cell layer configuration of
   local ATM interfaces on an ATM device in addition to the information
   on such interfaces contained in the ifTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   ATM Interface DS3 PLCP and TC Layer Groups</h3></a>

   These groups provide performance statistics of the DS3 PLCP and TC
   sublayer of local ATM interfaces on a managed ATM device.  DS3 PLCP
   and TC sublayer are currently used to carry ATM cells respectively
   over DS3 and SONET transmission paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   ATM Virtual Link and Cross-Connect Groups</h3></a>

   ATM virtual link and cross-connect groups model bi-directional ATM
   virtual links and ATM cross-connects.  The ATM VP/VC link groups are
   implemented in an ATM host, ATM switch and ATM network.  The ATM
   switch and ATM network also implement the ATM VP/VC cross-connect
   groups.  Both link and cross-connect groups are implemented in a
   carrier's network for Customer Network Management (CNM) purposes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ATM virtual link groups are used to create, delete or modify ATM
   virtual links in an ATM host, ATM switch and ATM network.  ATM
   virtual link groups along with the cross-connect groups are used to
   create, delete or modify ATM cross-connects in an ATM switch or ATM
   network (e.g., for CNM purposes).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Application of MIB II to ATM</h2></a>

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   The System Group</h3></a>

   For the purposes of the sysServices object in the System Group of MIB
   II [2], ATM is a data link layer protocol.  Thus, for ATM switches
   and ATM networks, sysServices will have the value "2".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   The Interface Group</h3></a>

   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing ATM interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [5] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable)
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.  Thus, the ATM cell layer interface is
   represented as an entry in the ifTable.  This entry is concerned with
   the ATM cell layer as a whole, and not with individual virtual
   connections which are managed via the ATM-specific managed objects
   specified in this memo.  The inter-relation of entries in the ifTable
   is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [5].
	<a name="section-6.2.1"><h4>6.2.1   Support of the ATM Cell Layer by ifTable</h4></a>

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for the ATM cell layer

                     Information Element (IE) of a signalling
                     message for a connection which either:
                     - would terminate at this interface, or
                     - for which the Called Party Address IE
                       would need to be replaced by the Called
                       Party SubAddress IE before the message
                       was forwarded to any other interface.
                     For an interface on which signalling is
                     not supported, then the interface does not
                     necessarily have an address, but if it
                     does, then ifPhysAddress is the address which
                     would be used as above in the event that

   Managing AAL5 in a switch involves:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (1) performance management of an AAL5 entity as<br>
          an internal resource in a switch

      (2) performance management of AAL5 per virtual connection<br>

   AAL5 in a switch is modeled as shown in Figures 4 and 5.  AAL5 will
   be managed in a switch for only those virtual connections that carry
   AAL5 and are terminated at the AAL5 entity in the switch.  Note that,
   the virtual channels within the ATM UNIs carrying AAL5 will be
   switched by the ATM switching fabric (termed as ATM Entity in the
   figure) to the virtual channels on a proprietary internal interface
   associated with the AAL5 process (termed as AAL5 Entity in the
   figure). Therefore, performance management of the AAL5 resource in
   the switch will be modeled using the ifTable through an internal
   (pseudo-ATM) virtual interface and the AAL5 performance management
   per virtual connection will be supported using an additional AAL5
   connection table in the ATM MIB.  The association between the AAL5
   virtual link at the proprietary virtual, internal interface and the
   ATM virtual link at the ATM interface will be derived from the
   virtual channel cross-connect table and the virtual channel link
   table in the ATM MIB.

                      This entry is used to model a bi-directional

                      Once the entries in the atmVplTable are created,
                      the following procedures are used
                      to cross-connect the VPLs together.
                     (1) The manager obtains a unique<br>
                         atmVpCrossConnectIndex by reading the
                         atmVpCrossConnectIndexNext object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                     (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one<br>
                         or more rows in the ATM VP Cross Connect
                         Table, one for each cross-connection between
                         two VPLs.  Each row is indexed by the ATM
                         interface port numbers and VPI values of the
                         two ends of that cross-connection.
                         This set of rows specifies the topology of the
                         VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single
                         value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                      Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment

                    (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by
                         setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to
                         createAndWait(5).  The agent checks the<br>
                         requested topology and the mutual sanity of
                         the ATM traffic parameters and
                         QoS Classes, i.e., the row creation fails if:
                         - the requested topology is not supported
                           by the agent,
                         - the traffic/QoS parameter values
                           associated with the requested row are
                           incompatible with those of already existing
                           rows for this VP cross-connect.
                         [For example, for setting up
                         a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the
                         ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction
                         of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect
                         must equal to the traffic parameters in the
                         transmit direction of the other VPL at the
                         high end of the cross-connect,
                         otherwise, the row creation fails.]
                         The agent also checks for internal errors
                         in building the cross-connect.

                         in by the agent at this point.

                         atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1).  If<br>
                         this set is successful, the agent has reserved

                         rows of this VP cross-connect to turn the
