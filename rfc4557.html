</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document defines a mechanism to enable in-band transmission of
   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses in the Kerberos
   network authentication protocol.  These responses are used to verify
   the validity of the certificates used in Public Key Cryptography for
   Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT), which is the Kerberos
   Version 5 extension that provides for the use of public key
   cryptography.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC2560] enables
   applications to obtain timely information regarding the revocation
   status of a certificate.  Because OCSP responses are well bounded and
   small in size, constrained clients may wish to use OCSP to check the
   validity of the certificates for Kerberos Key Distribution Center
   (KDC) in order to avoid transmission of large Certificate Revocation
   Lists (CRLs) and therefore save bandwidth on constrained networks
   [OCSP-PROFILE].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a pre-authentication type [RFC4120], where the
   client and the KDC MAY piggyback OCSP responses for certificates used
   in authentication exchanges, as defined in [RFC4556].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   By using this OPTIONAL extension, PKINIT clients and the KDC can
   maximize the reuse of cached OCSP responses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Message Definition</h2></a>

   A pre-authentication type identifier is defined for this mechanism:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE              18

   The corresponding padata-value field [RFC4120] contains the DER [X60]
   encoding of the following ASN.1 type:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          PKOcspData ::= SEQUENCE OF OcspResponse
                         -- If more than one OcspResponse is
                         -- included, the first OcspResponse
                         -- MUST contain the OCSP response
                         -- for the signer's certificate.
                         -- The signer refers to the client for
                         -- AS-REQ, and the KDC for the AS-REP,
                         -- respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          OcspResponse ::= OCTET STRING
                         -- Contains a complete OCSP response,
                         -- as defined in [RFC2560].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client MAY send OCSP responses for certificates used in PA-PK-
   AS-REQ [RFC4556] via a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE.
   The KDC that receives a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE SHOULD send a PA-PK-
   OCSP-RESPONSE containing OCSP responses for certificates used in the
   KDC's PA-PK-AS-REP.  The client can request a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE by
   using a PKOcspData containing an empty sequence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The KDC MAY send a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE when it does not receive a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE from the client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE sent by the KDC contains OCSP responses for
   certificates used in PA-PK-AS-REP [RFC4556].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note the lack of integrity protection for the empty or missing OCSP
   response; lack of an expected OCSP response from the KDC for the
   KDC's certificates SHOULD be treated as an error by the client,
   unless it is configured otherwise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using OCSP, the response is signed by the OCSP server, which is
   trusted by the receiver.  Depending on local policy, further
   verification of the validity of the OCSP servers may be needed

   The client and the KDC SHOULD ignore invalid OCSP responses received
   via this mechanism, and they MAY implement CRL processing logic as a
   fall-back position, if the OCSP responses received via this mechanism
   alone are not sufficient for the verification of certificate
   validity.  The client and/or the KDC MAY ignore a valid OCSP response
   and perform its own revocation status verification independently.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The pre-authentication data in this document do not actually
   authenticate any principals, but are designed to be used in
   conjunction with PKINIT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no binding between PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE pre-authentication
   data and PKINIT pre-authentication data other than a given OCSP
   response corresponding to a certificate used in a PKINIT pre-
   authentication data element.  Attacks involving removal or
   replacement of PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE pre-authentication data elements
   are, at worst, downgrade attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC would
   proceed without use of CRLs or OCSP for certificate validation, or
   denial-of-service attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC that cannot
   validate the other's certificate without an accompanying OCSP
   response might reject the AS exchange or might have to download very
   large CRLs in order to continue.  Kerberos V does not protect against
   denial-of-service attacks; therefore, the denial-of-service aspect of
   these attacks is acceptable.
   If a PKINIT client or KDC cannot validate certificates without the
   aid of a valid PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE, then it SHOULD fail the AS
   exchange, possibly according to local configuration.
