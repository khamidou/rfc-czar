              Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo describes Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol
   (RTMFP), an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to
   securely transport parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data
   messages, as well as bulk data, over IP networks.  RTMFP has features
   that make it effective for peer-to-peer (P2P) as well as client-
   server communications, even when Network Address Translators (NATs)
   are used.

   Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP) is intended for
   use as a general purpose endpoint-to-endpoint data transport service
   in IP networks.  It has features that make it well suited to the
   transport of real-time media (such as low-delay video, audio, and
   data) as well as bulk data, and for client-server as well as peer-to-
   peer (P2P) communication.  These features include independent
   parallel message flows that may have different delivery priorities,
   variable message reliability (from TCP-like full reliability to
   UDP-like best effort), multi-point congestion control, and built-in
   security.  Session multiplexing and facilities to support UDP
   hole-punching simplify Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal in
   peer-to-peer systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RTMFP is implemented in Flash Player, Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR),
   and Adobe Media Server (AMS, formerly Flash Media Server or FMS), all
   from Adobe Systems Incorporated, and is used as the foundation
   transport protocol for real-time video, audio, and data
   communication, both client-server and P2P, in those products.  At the
   time of writing, the Adobe Flash Player runtime is installed on more
   than one billion end-user desktop computers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RTMFP was developed by Adobe Systems Incorporated and is not the
   product of an IETF activity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo describes the syntax and operation of the Secure Real-Time
   Media Flow Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo describes a general security framework that, when combined
   with an application-specific Cryptography Profile, can be used to
   establish a confidential and authenticated session between endpoints.
   The application-specific Cryptography Profile, not defined herein,
   would detail the specific cryptographic algorithms, data formats, and
   semantics to be used within this framework.  Interoperation between
   applications of RTMFP requires common or compatible Cryptography
   Profiles.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note to implementers: at the time of writing, the Cryptography
   Profile used by the above-mentioned Adobe products is not publicly
   described by Adobe.  Implementers should investigate the availability
   of documentation of that Cryptography Profile prior to implementing
   RTMFP for the purpose of interoperation with the above-mentioned
   Adobe products.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Design Highlights of RTMFP</h3></a>

   Between any pair of communicating endpoints is a single,
   bidirectional, secured, congestion controlled session.
   Unidirectional flows convey messages from one end to the other within
   the session.  An endpoint can have concurrent sessions with multiple
   other far endpoints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Design highlights of RTMFP include the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The security framework is an inherent part of the basic protocol.
      The application designer chooses the cryptographic formats and
      algorithms to suit the needs of the application, and may update
      them as the state of the security arts progresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Cryptographic Endpoint Discriminators can resist port scanning.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  All header, control, and framing information, except for network
      addressing information and a session identifier, is encrypted
      according to the Cryptography Profile.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  There is a single session and associated congestion control state
      between a pair of endpoints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Each session may have zero or more unidirectional message-oriented
      flows in each direction.  All of a session's sending flows share
      the session's congestion control state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Return Flow Association (Section 2.3.11.1.2) generalizes
      bidirectional communication to arbitrarily complex trees of flows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Messages in flows can be arbitrarily large and are fragmented for
      transmission.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Messages of any size may be sent with full, partial, or no
      reliability (sender's choice).  Messages may be delivered to the
      receiving user in original queuing order or network arrival order
      (receiver's choice).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Flows are named with arbitrary, user-defined metadata
      (Section 2.3.11.1.1) rather than port or stream numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sequence numbers of each flow are independent of all other
      flows and are not permanently bound to a session-wide transmission
      ordering.  This allows real-time priority decisions to be made at
      transmission or retransmission time.
   o  Each flow has its own receive window and, therefore, independent
      flow control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Round trips are expensive and are minimized or eliminated when
      possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  After a session is established, flows begin by sending the flow's
      messages with no additional handshake (and associated round
      trips).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Transmitting bytes on the network is much more expensive than
      moving bytes in a CPU or memory.  Wasted bytes are minimized or
      eliminated when possible and practical, and variable length
      encodings are used, even at the expense of breaking 32-bit
      alignment and making the text diagrams in this specification look
      awkward.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  P2P lookup and peer introduction (including UDP hole-punching for
      NAT and firewall traversal) are supported directly by the session
      startup handshake.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Session identifiers allow an endpoint to multiplex many sessions
      over a single local transport address while allowing sessions to
      survive changes in transport address (as may happen in mobile or
      wireless deployments).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax of the protocol is detailed in Section 2.  The operation
   of the protocol is detailed in Section 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Terminology</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Syntax</h2></a>

   Definitions of types and structures in this specification use
   traditional text diagrams paired with procedural descriptions using a
   C-like syntax.  The C-like procedural descriptions SHALL be construed
   as definitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Structures are packed to take only as many bytes as explicitly
   indicated.  There is no 32-bit alignment constraint, and fields are
   not padded for alignment unless explicitly indicated or described.
   Text diagrams may include a bit ruler across the top; this is a
   convenience for counting bits in individual fields and does not
   necessarily imply field alignment on a multiple of the ruler width.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unless specified otherwise, reserved fields SHOULD be set to 0 by a
   sender and MUST be ignored by a receiver.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The procedural syntax of this specification defines correct and
   error-free encoded inputs to a parser.  The procedural syntax does
   not describe a fully featured parser, including error detection and
   handling.  Implementations MUST include means to identify error
   circumstances, including truncations causing elementary or composed
   types to not fit inside containing structures, fields, or elements.
   Unless specified otherwise, an error circumstance SHALL abort the
   parsing and processing of an element and its enclosing elements, up
   to the containing packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Common Elements</h3></a>

   This section lists types and structures that are used throughout this
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.1"><h4>2.1.1   Elementary Types and Constructs</h4></a>

   This section lists the elementary types and constructs out of which
   all of the following sections' definitions are built.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   remainder();

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The number of bytes from the current offset to the end of the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   type var[remainder()];

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A packed array of type, its size extending to the end of the

   A VLU encodes any finite non-negative integer into one or more bytes.
   For each encoded byte, if the high bit is set, the next byte is also
   part of the VLU.  If the high bit is clear, this is the final byte of
   the VLU.  The remaining bits encode the number, seven bits at a time,
   from most significant to least significant.

   An Option is a Length-Type-Value triplet.  Length and Type are
   encoded in VLU format.  Length is the number of bytes of payload
   following the Length field.  The payload comprises the Type and Value
   fields.  Type identifies the kind of option this is.  The syntax of
   the Value field is determined by the type of option.
   An Option can have a length of zero, in which case it has no type and
   no value and is empty.  An empty Option is called a "Marker".

   RTMFP packets are encrypted according to a Cryptography Profile.
   This specification doesn't define a Cryptography Profile or mandate a
   particular choice of cryptography.  The application defines the
   cryptographic syntax and algorithms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Packet encryption is RECOMMENDED to be a block cipher operating in
   Cipher Block Chaining [CBC] or similar mode.  Encrypted packets MUST
   be decipherable without inter-packet dependency, since packets may be
   lost, duplicated, or reordered in the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The packet encryption layer is responsible for data integrity and
   authenticity of packets, for example by means of a checksum or
   cryptographic message authentication code.  To mitigate replay

   An (unencrypted, plain) RTMFP packet consists of a variable sized
   common header, zero or more chunks, and padding.  Padding can be
   inserted by the encryption layer of the sender to meet cipher block
   size constraints and is ignored by the receiver.  A sender's

   0xff such that the resulting packet is a natural and appropriate size

   its own framing and padding scheme, if needed, such that decrypted
   packets are compatible with the syntax defined in this section.

        Figure 7: Sessions between Pairs of Communicating Endpoints

   Between any pair of communicating endpoints is a single,
   bidirectional, secured, congestion controlled session.
   Unidirectional flows convey messages from one end to the other within
   the session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An endpoint initiates a session to a far end when communication is
   desired.  An initiator begins with one or more candidate destination
   socket addresses, and it may learn and try more candidate addresses
   during startup handshaking.  Eventually, a first suitable response is
   received, and that endpoint is selected.  Startup proceeds to the
   selected endpoint.  In the case of session startup glare, one
   endpoint is the prevailing initiator and the other assumes the role
   of responder.  Encryption keys and session identifiers are negotiated
   between the endpoints, and the session is established.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each endpoint may begin sending message flows to the other end.  For
   each flow, the far end may accept it and deliver its messages to the
   user, or it may reject the flow and transmit an exception to the
   sender.  The flow receiver may close and reject a flow at a later
   time, after first accepting it.  The flow receiver acknowledges all
   data sent to it, regardless of whether the flow was accepted.
   Acknowledgements drive a congestion control mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An endpoint may have concurrent sessions with other far endpoints.
   The multiple sessions are distinguished by a session identifier
   rather than by socket address.  This allows an endpoint's address to
   change mid-session without having to tear down and re-establish a
   session.  The existing cryptographic state for a session can be used
   to verify a change of address while protecting against session
   hijacking or denial of service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A sender may indicate to a receiver that some user messages are of a
   time critical or real-time nature.  A receiver may indicate to
   senders on concurrent sessions that it is receiving time critical
   messages from another endpoint.  The other senders SHOULD modify
   their congestion control parameters to yield capacity to the session
   carrying time critical messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A sender may close a flow.  The flow is completed when the receiver
   has no outstanding gaps before the final fragment of the flow.  The
   sender and receiver reserve a completed flow's identifier for a time
   to allow in-flight messages to drain from the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Eventually, neither end will have any flows open to the other.  The
   session will be idle and quiescent.  Either end may reliably close
   the session to recover its resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In certain circumstances, an endpoint may be ceasing operation and
   not have time to wait for acknowledgement of a reliable session
   close.  In this case, the halting endpoint may send an abrupt session
   close to advise the far end that it is halting immediately.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Endpoint Identity</h3></a>

   Each RTMFP endpoint has an identity.  The identity is encoded in a
   certificate.  This specification doesn't mandate any particular
   certificate format, cryptographic algorithms, or cryptographic
   properties for certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An endpoint is named by an Endpoint Discriminator.  This
   specification doesn't mandate any particular format for Endpoint
   Discriminators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An Endpoint Discriminator MAY select more than one identity and MAY
   match more than one distinct certificate.
   Multiple distinct Endpoint Discriminators MAY match one certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that multiple endpoints not have the same identity.
   Entities with the same identity are indistinguishable during session
   startup; this situation could be undesirable in some applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An endpoint MAY have more than one address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Cryptography Profile implements the following functions for
   identities, certificates, and Endpoint Discriminators, whose
   operation MUST be deterministic:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Test whether a given certificate is authentic.  Authenticity can
      comprise verifying an issuer signature chain in a public key
      infrastructure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Test whether a given Endpoint Discriminator selects a given
      certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Test whether a given Endpoint Discriminator selects the local
      endpoint.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Generate a Canonical Endpoint Discriminator for a given
      certificate.  Canonical Endpoint Discriminators for distinct
      identities SHOULD be distinct.  If two distinct identities have
      the same Canonical Endpoint Discriminator, an initiator might
      abort a new opening session to the second identity
      (Section 3.5.1.1.1); this behavior might not be desirable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Given a certificate, a message, and a digital signature over the
      message, test whether the signature is valid and generated by the
      owner of the certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Generate a digital signature for a given message corresponding to
      the near identity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Given the near identity and a far certificate, determine which one
      shall prevail as Initiator and which shall assume the Responder
      role in the case of startup glare.  The far end MUST arrive at the
      same conclusion.  A comparison function can comprise performing a
      lexicographic ordering of the binary certificates, declaring the
      far identity the prevailing endpoint if the far certificate is
      ordered before the near certificate, and otherwise declaring the
      near identity to be the prevailing endpoint.
   o  Given a first certificate and a second certificate, test whether a
      new incoming session from the second shall override an existing
      session with the first.  It is RECOMMENDED that the test comprise
      testing whether the certificates are bitwise identical.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All other semantics for certificates and Endpoint Discriminators are
   determined by the Cryptography Profile and the application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Packet Multiplex</h3></a>

   An RTMFP typically has one or more interfaces through which it
   communicates with other RTMFP endpoints.  RTMFP can communicate with
   multiple distinct other RTMFP endpoints through each local interface.
   Session multiplexing over a shared interface can facilitate peer-to-
   peer communications through a NAT, by enabling third-party endpoints
   such as Forwarders (Section 3.5.1.5) and Redirectors
   (Section 3.5.1.4) to observe the translated public address and inform
   peers of the translation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An interface is typically a UDP socket (Section 2.2.1) but MAY be any
   suitable datagram transport service where endpoints can be addressed
   by IPv4 or IPv6 socket addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RTMFP uses a session ID to multiplex and demultiplex communications
   with distinct endpoints (Section 2.2.2), in addition to the endpoint
   socket address.  This allows an RTMFP to detect a far-end address
   change (as might happen, for example, in mobile and wireless
   scenarios) and allows communication sessions to survive address
   changes.  This also allows an RTMFP to act as a Forwarder or
   Redirector for an endpoint with which it has an active session, by
   distinguishing startup packets from those of the active session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On receiving a packet, an RTMFP decodes the session ID to look up the
   corresponding session information context and decryption key.
   Session ID 0 is reserved for session startup and MUST NOT be used for
   an active session.  A packet for Session ID 0 uses the Default
   Session Key as defined by the Cryptography Profile.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Packet Fragmentation</h3></a>

   When an RTMFP packet (Section 2.2.4) is unavoidably larger than the
   path MTU (such as a startup packet containing an RHello
   (Section 2.3.4) or IIKeying (Section 2.3.7) chunk with a large
   certificate), it can be fragmented into segments that do not exceed
   the path MTU by using the Packet Fragment chunk (Section 2.3.1).
   The packet fragmentation mechanism SHOULD be used only to segment
   unavoidably large packets.  Accordingly, this mechanism SHOULD be
   employed only during session startup with Session ID 0.  This
   mechanism MUST NOT be used instead of the natural fragmentation
   mechanism of the User Data (Section 2.3.11) and Next User Data
   (Section 2.3.12) chunks for dividing the messages of the user's data
   flows into segments that do not exceed the path MTU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A fragmented plain RTMFP packet is reassembled by concatenating the
   packetFragment fields of the fragments for the packet in contiguous
   ascending order, starting from index 0 through and including the
   final fragment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When reassembling packets for Session ID 0, a receiver SHOULD
   identify the packets by the socket address from which the packet
   containing the fragment was received, as well as the indicated
   packetID.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A receiver SHOULD allow up to 60 seconds to completely receive a
   fragmented packet for which progress is being made.  A packet is
   progressing if at least one new fragment for it was received in the
   last second.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A receiver MUST discard a Packet Fragment chunk having an empty
   packetFragment field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mode of each packet containing Packet Fragments for the same
   fragmented packet MUST match the mode of the fragmented packet.  A
   receiver MUST discard any new Packet Fragment chunk received in a
   packet with a mode different from the mode of the packet containing
   the first received fragment.  A receiver MUST discard any reassembled
   packet with a mode different than the packets containing its
   fragments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to avoid jamming the network, the sender MUST rate limit
   packet transmission.  In the absence of specific path capacity
   information (for instance, during session startup), a sender SHOULD
   NOT send more than 4380 bytes nor more than four packets per distinct
   endpoint every 200 ms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To avoid resource exhaustion, a receiver SHOULD limit the number of
   concurrent packet reassembly buffers and the size of each buffer.
   Limits can depend, for example, on the expected size of reassembled
   packets, on the rate at which fragmented packets are expected to be
   received, on the expected degree of interleaving, and on the expected
   function of the receiver.  Limits can depend on the available
   resources of the receiver.  There can be different limits for packets
   with Session ID 0 and packets for established sessions.  For example,
   a busy server might need to allow for several hundred concurrent
   packet reassembly buffers to accommodate hundreds of connection
   requests per second with potentially interleaved fragments, but a
   client device with constrained resources could allow just a few
   reassembly buffers.  In the absence of specific information regarding
   the expected size of reassembled packets, a receiver should set the
   limit for each packet reassembly buffer to 65536 bytes.

   RTMFP sessions are established with a 4-way handshake in two round
   trips.  The initiator begins by sending an IHello to one or more
   candidate addresses for the desired destination endpoint.  A
   responder statelessly sends an RHello in response.  The first correct
   RHello received at the initiator is selected; all others are ignored.
   The initiator computes its half of the session keying and sends an
   IIKeying.  The responder receives the IIKeying and, if it is
   acceptable, computes its half of the session keying, at which point
   it can also compute the shared session keying and session nonces.
   The responder creates a new S_OPEN session with the initiator and
   sends an RIKeying.  The initiator receives the RIKeying and, if it is
   acceptable, computes the shared session keying and session nonces.
   The initiator's session is now S_OPEN.

                        Figure 9: Normal Handshake

   In the following sections, the handshake is detailed from the
   perspectives of the initiator and responder.
<a name="section-3.5.1.1"><h4>3.5.1.1 1.  Initiator</h4></a>
                    

   The initiator determines that a session is needed for an Endpoint
   Discriminator.  The initiator creates state for a new opening session
   and begins with a candidate endpoint address set containing at least
   one address.  The new session is placed in the S_IHELLO_SENT state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the session does not move to the S_OPEN state before an ultimate
   open timeout, the session has failed and moves to the S_OPEN_FAILED
   state.  The RECOMMENDED ultimate open timeout is 95 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The initiator chooses a new, unique tag not used by any currently
   opening session.  It is RECOMMENDED that the tag be cryptographically
   pseudorandom and be at least 8 bytes in length, so that it is hard to
   guess.  The initiator constructs an IHello chunk (Section 2.3.2) with
   the Endpoint Discriminator and the tag.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While the initiator is in the S_IHELLO_SENT state, it sends the
   IHello to each candidate endpoint address in the set, on a backoff
   schedule.  The backoff SHOULD NOT be less than multiplicative, with
   not less than 1.5 seconds added to the interval between each attempt.
   The backoff SHOULD be scheduled separately for each candidate
   address, since new candidates can be added over time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the initiator receives a Redirect chunk (Section 2.3.5) with a tag
   echo matching this session, AND this session is in the S_IHELLO_SENT
   state, then for each redirect destination indicated in the Redirect:
   if the candidate endpoint address set contains fewer than
   REDIRECT_THRESHOLD addresses, add the indicated redirect destination
   to the candidate endpoint address set.  REDIRECT_THRESHOLD SHOULD NOT
   be more than 24.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the initiator receives an RHello chunk (Section 2.3.4) with a tag
   echo matching this session, AND this session is in the S_IHELLO_SENT
   state, AND the responder certificate matches the desired Endpoint
   Discriminator, AND the certificate is authentic according to the
   Cryptography Profile, then:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If the Canonical Endpoint Discriminator for the responder
       certificate matches the Canonical Endpoint Discriminator of
       another existing session in the S_KEYING_SENT or S_OPEN states,
       AND the certificate of the other opening session matches the
       desired Endpoint Discriminator, then this session is a duplicate
       and SHOULD be aborted in favor of the other existing session;
       otherwise,
   2.  Move to the S_KEYING_SENT state.  Set DESTADDR, the far-end
       address for the session, to the address from which this RHello
       was received.  The initiator chooses a new, unique receive
       session ID, not used by any other session, for the responder to
       use when sending packets to the initiator.  It computes a Session
       Key Initiator Component appropriate to the responder's
       certificate according to the Cryptography Profile.  Using this
       data and the cookie from the RHello, the initiator constructs and
       signs an IIKeying chunk (Section 2.3.7).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While the initiator is in the S_KEYING_SENT state, it sends the
   IIKeying to DESTADDR on a backoff schedule.  The backoff SHOULD NOT
   be less than multiplicative, with not less than 1.5 seconds added to
   the interval between each attempt.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the initiator receives an RIKeying chunk (Section 2.3.8) in a
   packet with this session's receive session identifier, AND this
   session is in the S_KEYING_SENT state, AND the signature in the chunk
   is authentic according to the far end's certificate (from the
   RHello), AND the Session Key Responder Component successfully
   combines with the Session Key Initiator Component and the near and
   far certificates to form the shared session keys and nonces according
   to the Cryptography Profile, then the session has opened
   successfully.  The session moves to the S_OPEN state.  The send
   session identifier is set from the RIKeying.  Packet encryption,
   decryption, and verification now use the newly computed shared
   session keys, and the session nonces are available for application-
   layer cryptographic challenges.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.5.1.1"><h4>3.5.1.1 2.  Responder</h4></a>
                    

   On receipt of an IHello chunk (Section 2.3.2) with an Endpoint
   Discriminator that selects its identity, an endpoint SHOULD construct
   an RHello chunk (Section 2.3.4) and send it to the address from which
   the IHello was received.  To avoid a potential resource exhaustion
   denial of service, the endpoint SHOULD NOT create any persistent
   state associated with the IHello.  The endpoint MUST generate the
   cookie for the RHello in such a way that it can be recognized as
   authentic and valid when echoed in an IIKeying.  The endpoint SHOULD
   use the address from which the IHello was received as part of the
   cookie generation formula.  Cookies SHOULD be valid only for a
   limited time; that lifetime SHOULD NOT be less than 95 seconds (the
   recommended ultimate session open timeout).
   On receipt of an FIHello chunk (Section 2.3.3) from a Forwarder
   (Section 3.5.1.5) where the Endpoint Discriminator selects its
   identity, an endpoint SHOULD do one of the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Compute, construct, and send an RHello as though the FIHello was
       an IHello received from the indicated reply address; or

   2.  Construct and send an Implied Redirect (Section 2.3.5) to the
       FIHello's reply address; or

   3.  Ignore this FIHello.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On receipt of an IIKeying chunk (Section 2.3.7), if the cookie is not
   authentic or if it has expired, ignore this IIKeying; otherwise,

   On receipt of an IIKeying chunk, if the cookie appears authentic but
   does not match the address from which the IIKeying's packet was
   received, perform the special processing at Cookie Change
   (Section 3.5.1.2); otherwise,

   On receipt of an IIKeying with an authentic and valid cookie, if the
   certificate is authentic according to the Cryptography Profile, AND
   the signature in the chunk is authentic according to the far end's
   certificate and the Cryptography Profile, AND the Session Key
   Initiator Component is acceptable, then:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If the address from which this IIKeying was received corresponds
       to an opening session in the S_IHELLO_SENT or S_KEYING_SENT
       state, perform the special processing at Glare (Section 3.5.1.3);
       otherwise,

   2.  If the address from which this IIKeying was received corresponds
       to a session in the S_OPEN state, then:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       1.  If the receiver was the Responder for the S_OPEN session and
           the session identifier, certificate, and Session Key
           Initiator Component are identical to those of the S_OPEN
           session, this IIKeying is a retransmission, so resend the
           S_OPEN session's RIKeying using the Default Session Key as
           specified below; otherwise,

       2.  If the certificate from this IIKeying does not override the
           certificate of the S_OPEN session, ignore this IIKeying;
           otherwise,
       3.  The certificate from this IIKeying overrides the certificate
           of the S_OPEN session; this is a new opening session from the
           same identity, and the existing S_OPEN session is stale.
           Move the existing S_OPEN session to S_CLOSED and abort all of
           its flows (signaling exceptions to the user), then continue
           processing this IIKeying.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       Otherwise,

   3.  Compute a Session Key Responder Component and choose a new,
       unique receive session ID not used by any other session for the
       initiator to use when sending packets to the responder.  Using
       this data, construct and, with the Session Key Initiator
       Component, sign an RIKeying chunk (Section 2.3.8).  Using the
       Session Key Initiator and Responder Components and the near and
       far certificates, the responder combines and computes the shared
       session keys and nonces according to the Cryptography Profile.
       The responder creates a new session in the S_OPEN state, with the
       far-endpoint address DESTADDR taken from the source address of
       the packet containing the IIKeying and the send session
       identifier taken from the IIKeying.  The responder sends the
       RIKeying to the initiator using the Default Session Key and the
       requested send session identifier.  Packet encryption,
       decryption, and verification of all future packets for this
       session use the newly computed keys, and the session nonces are
       available for application-layer cryptographic challenges.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.5.1.2"><h4>3.5.1.2   Cookie Change</h4></a>
                    

   In some circumstances, the responder may generate an RHello cookie
   for an initiator's address that isn't the address the initiator would
   use when sending packets directly to the responder.  This can happen,
   for example, when the initiator has multiple local addresses and uses
   one address to reach a Forwarder (Section 3.5.1.5) but another to
   reach the responder.
   Consider the following example:

                  Figure 10: Handshake with Cookie Change

   The initiator has two network interfaces: a first preferred interface
   with address Ix = 192.0.2.100:50000, and a second with address Iy =
   198.51.100.101:50001.  The responder has one interface with address
   Ry = 198.51.100.200:51000, on the same network as the initiator's
   second interface.  The initiator uses its first interface to reach a
   Forwarder.  The Forwarder observes the initiator's address of Ix and
   sends a Forwarded IHello (Section 2.3.3) to the responder.  The
   responder treats this as if it were an IHello from Ix, calculates a
   corresponding cookie, and sends an RHello to Ix.  The initiator
   receives this RHello from Ry and selects that address as the
   destination for the session.  It then sends an IIKeying, copying the
   cookie from the RHello.  However, since the source of the RHello is
   Ry, on a network to which the initiator is directly connected, the
   initiator uses its second interface Iy to send the IIKeying.  The
   responder, on receiving the IIKeying, will compare the cookie to the
   expected value based on the source address of the packet, and since
   the IIKeying source doesn't match the IHello source used to generate
   the cookie, the responder will reject the IIKeying.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the responder determines that it generated the cookie in the
   IIKeying but the cookie doesn't match the sender's address (for
   example, if the cookie is in two parts, with a first part generated
   independently of the initiator's address and a second part dependent
   on the address), the responder SHOULD generate a new cookie based on
   the address from which the IIKeying was received and send an RHello
   Cookie Change chunk (Section 2.3.6) to the source of the IIKeying,
   using the session ID from the IIKeying and the Default Session Key.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the initiator receives an RHello Cookie Change chunk for a session
   in the S_KEYING_SENT state, AND the old cookie matches the one
   originally sent to the responder, then the initiator adopts the new
   cookie, constructs and signs a new IIKeying chunk, and sends the new
   IIKeying to the responder.  The initiator SHOULD NOT change the
   cookie for a session more than once.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.5.1.3"><h4>3.5.1.3   Glare</h4></a>
                    

   Glare occurs when two endpoints attempt to initiate sessions to each
   other concurrently.  Glare is detected by receipt of a valid and
   authentic IIKeying from an endpoint address that is a destination for
   an opening session.  Only one session is allowed between a pair of
   endpoints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Glare is resolved by comparing the certificate in the received
   IIKeying with the near end's certificate.  The Cryptography Profile
   defines a certificate comparison function to determine the prevailing
   endpoint when there is glare.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the near end prevails, discard and ignore the received IIKeying.
   The far end will abort its opening session on receipt of IIKeying
   from the near end.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Otherwise, the far end prevails:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If the certificate in the IIKeying overrides the certificate
       associated with the near opening session according to the
       Cryptography Profile, then abort and destroy the near opening
       session.  Then,

   A Redirector acts like a name server for Endpoint Discriminators.

            Figure 17: Handshake with Redirector and Forwarder

   At the point in Figure 17 marked (*), the responder's RHello from the
   FIHello might arrive at the initiator's NAT before or after the
   initiator's IHello is sent outbound to the responder's public NAT
   address.  If it arrives before, it may be dropped by the NAT.  If it
   arrives after, it will transit the NAT and trigger keying without
   waiting for another round-trip time.  The timing of this race
   depends, among other factors, on the relative distances of the
   initiator and responder from each other and from the introduction
   service.

              Figure 18: Parallel Open to Multiple Endpoints

   As specified in Section 3.2, more than one endpoint is allowed to be
   selected by one Endpoint Discriminator.  This will typically be the
   case for a set of servers, any of which could accommodate a
   connecting client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As specified in Section 3.5.1.1.1, an initiator is allowed to use
   multiple candidate endpoint addresses when starting a session, and
   the sender of the first acceptable RHello chunk to be received is
   selected to complete the session, with later responses ignored.  An
   initiator can start with the multiple candidate endpoint addresses,
   or it may learn them during startup from one or more Redirectors
   (Section 3.5.1.4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Parallel open to multiple endpoints for the same Endpoint
   Discriminator, combined with selection by earliest RHello, can be
   used for load distribution and fault tolerance.  The cost at each
   endpoint that is not selected is limited to receiving and processing
   an IHello, and generating and sending an RHello.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In one circumstance, multiple servers of similar processing and
   networking capacity may be located in near proximity to each other,
   such as in a data center.  In this circumstance, a less heavily
   loaded server can respond to an IHello more quickly than more heavily
   loaded servers and will tend to be selected by a client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In another circumstance, multiple servers may be located in different
   physical locations, such as different data centers.  In this
   circumstance, a server that is located nearer (in terms of network
   distance) to the client can respond earlier than more distant servers
   and will tend to be selected by the client.
   Multiple servers, in proximity or distant from one another, can form
   a redundant pool of servers.  A client can perform a parallel open to
   the multiple servers.  In normal operation, the multiple servers will
   all respond, and the client will select one of them as described
   above.  If one of the multiple servers fails, other servers in the
   pool can still respond to the client, allowing the client to succeed
   to an S_OPEN session with one of them.

   A flow is a unidirectional communication channel in a session for
   transporting a correlated series of user messages from a sender to a
   receiver.  Each end of a session may have zero or more sending flows
   to the other end.  Each sending flow at one end has a corresponding
   receiving flow at the other end.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.6.1"><h4>3.6.1   Overview</h4></a>

<a name="section-3.6.1.1"><h4>3.6.1.1   Identity</h4></a>
                    

   Flows are multiplexed in a session by a flow identifier.  Each end of
   a session chooses its sending flow identifiers independently of the
   other end.  The choice of similar flow identifiers by both ends does
   not imply an association.  A sender MAY choose any identifier for any
   flow; therefore, a flow receiver MUST NOT ascribe any semantic
   meaning, role, or name to a flow based only on its identifier.  There
   are no "well known" or reserved flow identifiers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bidirectional flow association is indicated at flow startup with the
   Return Flow Association option (Section 2.3.11.1.2).  An endpoint can
   indicate that a new sending flow is in return (or response) to a
   receiving flow from the other end.  A sending flow MUST NOT indicate
   more than one return association.  A receiving flow can be specified
   as the return association for any number of sending flows.  The
   return flow association, if any, is fixed for the lifetime of the
   sending flow.  Note: Closure of one flow in an association does not
   automatically close other flows in the association, except as
   specified in Section 3.6.3.1.
   Flows are named with arbitrary user metadata.  This specification
   doesn't mandate any particular encoding, syntax, or semantics for the
   user metadata, except for the encoded size (Section 2.3.11.1.1); the
   user metadata is entirely reserved for the application.  The user
   metadata is fixed for the lifetime of the flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.6.1.2"><h4>3.6.1.2   Messages and Sequencing</h4></a>
                    

   Flows provide message-oriented framing.  Large messages are
   fragmented for transport in the network.  Receivers reassemble
   fragmented messages and only present complete messages to the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A sender queues messages on a sending flow one after another.  A
   receiver can recover the original queuing order of the messages, even
   when they are reordered in transit by the network or as a result of
   loss and retransmission, by means of the messages' fragment sequence
   numbers.  Flows are the basic units of message sequencing; each flow
   is sequenced independently of all other flows; inter-flow message
   arrival and delivery sequencing are not guaranteed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Independent flow sequencing allows a sender to prioritize the
   transmission or retransmission of the messages of one flow over those
   of other flows in a session, allocating capacity from the
   transmission budget according to priority.  RTMFP is designed for
   flows to be the basic unit of prioritization.  In any flow, fragment
   sequence numbers are unique and monotonically increasing; that is,
   the fragment sequence numbers for any message MUST be greater than
   the fragment sequence numbers of all messages previously queued in
   that flow.  Receipt of fragments out of sequence number order within
   a flow creates discontiguous gaps at the receiver, causing it to send
   an acknowledgement for every packet and also causing the size of the
   encoded acknowledgements to grow.  Therefore, for any flow, the
   sender SHOULD send lower sequence numbers first.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A sender can abandon a queued message at any time, even if some
   fragments of that message have been received by the other end.  A
   receiver MUST be able to detect a gap in the flow when a message is
   abandoned; therefore, each message SHOULD take at least one sequence
   number from the sequence space even if no fragments for that message
   are ever sent.  The sender will transmit the fragments of all
   messages not abandoned, and retransmit any lost fragments of all
   messages not abandoned, until all the fragments of all messages not
   abandoned are acknowledged by the receiver.  A sender indicates a
   Forward Sequence Number (FSN) to instruct the receiver that sequence
   numbers less than or equal to the FSN will not be transmitted or
   retransmitted.  This allows the receiver to move forward over gaps
   and continue sequenced delivery of completely received messages to
   the user.  Any incomplete messages missing fragments with sequence
   numbers less than or equal to the FSN were abandoned by the sender
   and will never be completed.  A gap indication MUST be communicated
   to the receiving user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.6.1.3"><h4>3.6.1.3   Lifetime</h4></a>
                    

   A sender begins a flow by sending user message fragments to the other
   end, and including the user metadata and, if any, the return flow
   association.  The sender continues to include the user metadata and
   return flow association until the flow is acknowledged by the far
   end, at which point the sender knows that the receiver has received
   the user metadata and, if any, the return flow association.  After
   that point, the flow identifier alone is sufficient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Flow receivers SHOULD acknowledge all sequence numbers received for
   any flow, whether the flow is accepted or rejected.  Flow receivers
   MUST NOT acknowledge sequence numbers higher than the FSN that were
   not received.  Acknowledgements drive the congestion control and
   avoidance algorithms and therefore must be accurate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An endpoint can reject a receiving flow at any time in the flow's
   lifetime.  To reject the flow, the receiving endpoint sends a Flow
   Exception Report chunk (Section 2.3.16) immediately preceding every
   acknowledgement chunk for the rejected receiving flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An endpoint may eventually conclude and close a sending flow.  The
   last sequence number of the flow is marked with the Final flag.  The

   acknowledged by the receiver.  The receiving flow is complete when
   every sequence number from the FSN to the final sequence number has
   been received.  The sending flow and corresponding receiving flow at
   the respective ends hold the flow identifier of a completed flow in
   reserve for a time to allow delayed or duplicated fragments and
   acknowledgements to drain from the network without erroneously
   initiating a new receiving flow or erroneously acknowledging a new
   sending flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a flow sender receives a Flow Exception indication from the other

   The application opens a new sending flow to the other end in an
   S_OPEN session.  The implementation chooses a new flow ID that is not
   assigned to any other sending flow in that session in the F_OPEN,
   F_CLOSING, or F_COMPLETE_LINGER states.  The flow starts in the
   F_OPEN state.  The STARTUP_OPTIONS for the new flow is set with the
   User's Per-Flow Metadata (Section 2.3.11.1.1).  If this flow is in
   return (or response) to a receiving flow from the other end, that
   flow's ID is encoded in a Return Flow Association
   (Section 2.3.11.1.2) option and added to STARTUP_OPTIONS.  A new
   sending flow SHOULD NOT be opened in response to a receiving flow
   from the other end that is not in the RF_OPEN state when the sending
   flow is opened.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At this point, the flow exists in the sender but not in the receiver.
   The flow begins when user data fragments are transmitted to the
   receiver.  A sender can begin a flow in the absence of immediate user
   data by sending a Forward Sequence Number Update (Section 3.6.2.7.1),
   by queuing and transmitting a user data fragment that is already
   abandoned.

   The application queues messages in an F_OPEN sending flow for
   transmission to the far end.  The implementation divides each message
   into one or more fragments for transmission in User Data chunks
   (Section 2.3.11).  Each fragment MUST be small enough so that, if
   assembled into a packet (Section 2.2.4) with a maximum-size common
   header, User Data chunk header, and, if not empty, this flow's
   STARTUP_OPTIONS, the packet will not exceed the path MTU
   (Section 3.5.4.3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For each fragment, create a fragment entry and set
   fragmentEntry.SEQUENCE_NUMBER to flow.NEXT_SN, and increment

   The application can abandon queued messages at any time and for any

   following: one or more fragments of a message have remained in the
   SEND_QUEUE for longer than a specified message lifetime; a fragment
   has been retransmitted more than a specified retransmission limit; a
   prior message on which this message depends (such as a key frame in a

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To abandon a message fragment, set its SEND_QUEUE entry's ABANDON
   flag to true.  When abandoning a message fragment, abandon all
   fragments of the message to which it belongs.

   Abandoned data may leave gaps in the sequence number space of a flow.
   Gaps may cause the receiver to hold completely received messages for
   ordered delivery to allow for retransmission of the missing
   fragments.  User Data chunks (Section 2.3.11) encode a Forward
   Sequence Number (FSN) to instruct the receiver that fragments with
   sequence numbers less than or equal to the FSN will not be
   transmitted or retransmitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the receiver has gaps in the received sequence number space and

   sender SHOULD transmit a Forward Sequence Number Update (FSN Update)
   comprising a User Data chunk marked abandoned, whose sequence number
   is the FSN and whose fsnOffset is 0.  An FSN Update allows the
   receiver to skip gaps that will not be repaired and deliver received
   messages to the user.  An FSN Update may be thought of as a
   transmission or retransmission of abandoned sequence numbers without

   A receiving flow's information context contains a RECV_BUFFER for
   reordering, reassembling, and holding the user data messages of the
   flow.  Only complete messages are delivered to the user; an
   implementation MUST NOT deliver partially received messages, except
   by special arrangement with the user.
   Let the Cumulative Acknowledgement Sequence Number (CSN) be the
   highest number in the contiguous range of numbers in SEQUENCE_SET
   starting with 0.  For example, if SEQUENCE_SET contains {0, 1, 2, 3,
   5, 6}, the contiguous range starting with 0 is 0..3, so the CSN is 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A message is complete if all of its fragments are present in the
   RECV_BUFFER.  The fragments of one message have contiguous sequence
   numbers.  A message can be either a single fragment, whose fragment
   control value is 0-whole, or two or more fragments where the first's
   fragment control value is 1-begin, followed by zero or more fragments
   with control value 3-middle, and terminated by a last fragment with
   control value 2-end.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An incomplete message segment is a contiguous sequence of one or more
   fragments that do not form a complete message -- that is, a 1-begin
   followed by zero or more 3-middle fragments but with no 2-end, or
   zero or more 3-middle fragments followed by a 2-end but with no
   1-begin, or one or more 3-middle fragments with neither a 1-begin nor
   a 2-end.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Incomplete message segments can either be in progress or abandoned.
   An incomplete segment is abandoned in the following cases:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sequence number of the segment's first fragment is less than
      or equal to the CSN, AND that fragment's control value is not
      1-begin; or

   o  The sequence number of the segment's last fragment is less than
      the CSN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Abandoned message segments will never be completed, so they SHOULD be
   removed from the RECV_BUFFER to make room in the advertised receive
   window and the receiver's memory for messages that can be completed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The user can suspend delivery of a flow's messages.  A suspended
   receiving flow holds completed messages in its RECV_BUFFER until the
   user resumes delivery.  A suspended flow can cause the receive window
   advertisement to go to zero even when the BUFFER_CAPACITY is
   non-zero; this is described in detail in Section 3.6.3.5
   ("Flow Control").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the receiving flow is not suspended, the original queuing order
   of the messages is recovered by delivering, in ascending sequence
   number order, complete messages in the RECV_BUFFER whose sequence
   numbers are less than or equal to the CSN.
   The following describes a method for discarding abandoned message
   segments and delivering complete messages in original queuing order
   when the receiving flow is not suspended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While the first fragment entry in the RECV_BUFFER has a sequence
   number less than or equal to the CSN and delivery is still possible:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If entry.FRA is 0-whole, deliver entry.DATA to the user, and
       remove this entry from RECV_BUFFER; otherwise,

   2.  If entry.FRA is 2-end or 3-middle, this entry belongs to an
       abandoned segment, so remove and discard this entry from
       RECV_BUFFER; otherwise,

   3.  Entry.FRA is 1-begin.  Let LAST_ENTRY be the last RECV_BUFFER
       entry that is part of this message segment (LAST_ENTRY can be
       entry if the segment has only one fragment so far).  Then:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       1.  If LAST_ENTRY.FRA is 2-end, this segment is a complete
           message, so concatenate the DATA fields of each fragment
           entry of this segment in ascending sequence number order and
           deliver the complete message to the user, then remove the
           entries for this complete message from RECV_BUFFER;
           otherwise,

       2.  If LAST_ENTRY.SEQUENCE_NUMBER is less than CSN, this segment
           is incomplete and abandoned, so remove and discard the
           entries for this segment from RECV_BUFFER; otherwise,

       3.  LAST_ENTRY.SEQUENCE_NUMBER is equal to CSN and LAST_ENTRY.FRA
           is not 2-end: this segment is incomplete but still in
           progress.  Ordered delivery is no longer possible until at
           least one more fragment is received.  Stop.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If flow.RF_FINAL_SN has a value and is equal to the CSN, AND
   RECV_BUFFER is empty, all complete messages have been delivered to
   the user, so notify the user that the flow is complete.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.6.3.4"><h4>3.6.3.4   Acknowledging Data</h4></a>
                    

   A flow receiver SHOULD acknowledge all user data fragment sequence
   numbers seen in that flow.  Acknowledgements drive the sender's
   congestion control and avoidance algorithms, clear data from the
   sender's buffers, and in some sender implementations clock new data
   into the network; therefore, the acknowledgements must be accurate
   and timely.
<a name="section-3.6.3.4"><h4>3.6.3.4 1.  Timing</h4></a>
                    

   For reasons similar to those discussed in Section 4.2.3.2 of RFC 1122
   [RFC1122], it is advantageous to delay sending acknowledgements for a
   short time, so that multiple data fragments can be acknowledged in a
   single transmission.  However, it is also advantageous for a sender
   to receive timely notification about the receiver's disposition of
   the flow, particularly in unusual or exceptional circumstances, so
   that the circumstances can be addressed if possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On receipt of a User Data chunk where, after processing the chunk,
      the flow's SEQUENCE_SET does not contain every sequence number

      this chunk causes a sequence number gap);

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On receipt of a Buffer Probe for the flow;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On receipt of a User Data chunk if the last acknowledgement sent

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On receipt of a User Data or Next User Data chunk for the flow if,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On receipt of a User Data or Next User Data chunk for any sequence
      number that was already seen (that is, on receipt of a duplicate);

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  On the first receipt of the final sequence number of the flow;

   The receiver's RF_COMPLETE_LINGER period is two minutes (one Maximum
   Segment Lifetime (MSL)); this period allows any in-flight packets to
   drain from the network without being misidentified and gives the
   sender an opportunity to retransmit any sequence numbers if the
   completing acknowledgement is lost.  The sender's F_COMPLETE_LINGER
   period is at least two minutes plus 10 seconds and doesn't begin
   until the completing acknowledgement is received; therefore, the same
   flow identifier won't be reused by the flow sender for a new sending
   flow for at least 10 seconds after the flow receiver has closed the
   receiving flow context.  This ensures correct operation independent
   of network delay, even when the sender's clock runs up to 8 percent

   the desired responder does, since only the first received RHello is

   are immune to replay while they are open.  However, once a flow has
   completed and the linger period has concluded, the attacker could
   replay the recorded packets, opening a new flow in the receiver and
   duplicating the flow's data; this replay might have undesirable
   effects on the receiver's application.  The attacker could also infer
   that a new flow has begun reusing the recorded flow's identifier and

Appendix A.  Example Congestion Control Algorithm

   As mandated in Section 3.5.2, an RTMFP is required to use TCP-
   compatible congestion control, but flexibility in exact
   implementation is allowed, within certain limits.  This section
   describes an experimental window-based congestion control algorithm
   that is appropriate for real-time and bulk data transport in RTMFP.
   The algorithm includes slow start and congestion avoidance phases,
   including modified increase and decrease parameters.  These
   parameters are further adjusted according to whether real-time data
   is being sent and whether Time Critical Reverse Notifications are
   received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A.1.  Discussion

   RFC 5681 defines the standard window-based congestion control
   algorithms for TCP.  These algorithms are appropriate for delay-
   insensitive bulk data transport but have undesirable behaviors for
   delay- and loss-sensitive applications.  Among the undesirable
   behaviors are the cutting of the congestion window in half during a
   loss event, and the rapidity of the slow start algorithm's
   exponential growth.  Cutting the congestion window in half requires a
   large channel headroom to support a real-time application and can
   cause a large amount of jitter from sender-side buffering.  Doubling
   the congestion window during the slow start phase can lead to the
   congestion window temporarily growing to twice the size it should be,
   causing a period of excessive loss in the path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We found that a number of deployed TCP implementations use the method
   of equation (3) from Section 3.1 of RFC 5681; this method, when<br>
   combined with the recommended behavior of acknowledging every other
   packet, causes the congestion window to grow at approximately half
   the rate that the recommended method specifies.  In order to compete
   fairly with these deployed TCPs, we choose 768 bytes per round trip
   as the increment during the normal congestion avoidance phase; this
   is approximately half of the typical maximum segment size of
   1500 bytes and is also easily subdivided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The sender may be sending real-time data to the far end.  When
   sending real-time data, a smoother response to congestion is desired
   while still competing with reasonable fairness to other flows in the
   Internet.  In order to scale the sending rate quickly, the slow start
   algorithm is desired, but slow start's normal rate of increase can
   cause excessive loss in the last round trip.  Accordingly, slow
   start's exponential increase rate is adjusted to double approximately
   every 3 round trips instead of every round trip.  The multiplicative
   decrease cuts the congestion window by one eighth on loss to maintain
   a smoother sending rate.  The additive increase is done at half the
   normal rate (incrementing at 384 bytes per round trip), to both
   compensate for the less aggressive loss response and probe the path
   capacity more gently.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The far end may report that it is receiving real-time data from other
   peers, or the sender may be sending real-time data to other far ends.
   In these circumstances (if not sending real-time data to this far
   end), it is desirable to respond differently than the standard TCP
   algorithms specify, to both yield capacity to the real-time flows and
   avoid excessive losses while probing the path capacity.  Slow start's
   exponential increase is disabled, and the additive increase is done
   at half the normal rate (incrementing at 384 bytes per round trip).
   Multiplicative decrease is left at the normal rate (cutting by half)
   to yield to other flows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since real-time messages may be small, and sent regularly, it is
   advantageous to spread congestion window increases out across the
   round-trip time instead of doing them all at once.  We divide the
   round trip into 16 segments with an additive increase of a useful
   size (48 bytes) per segment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Scalable TCP [ScalableTCP] describes experimental methods of
   modifying the additive increase and multiplicative decrease of the
   congestion window in large delay-bandwidth scenarios.  The congestion
   window is increased by 1% each round trip and decreased by one eighth
   on loss in the congestion avoidance phase in certain circumstances
   (specifically, when a 1% increase is larger than the normal additive-
   increase amount).  Those methods are adapted here.  The scalable
   increase amount is 48 bytes for every 4800 bytes acknowledged, to
   spread the increase out over the round trip.  The congestion window
   is decreased by one eighth on loss when it is at least 67200 bytes
   per round trip, which is seven eighths of 76800 (the point at which
   1% is greater than 768 bytes per round trip).  When sending real-time
   data to the far end, the scalable increase is 1% or 384 bytes per
   round trip, whichever is greater.  Otherwise, when notified that the
   far end is receiving real-time data from other peers, the scaled
   increase is adjusted to 0.5% or 384 bytes per round trip, whichever
   is greater.
