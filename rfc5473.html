   This document describes a bandwidth saving method for exporting Flow
   or packet information using the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
   protocol.  As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol is based on IPFIX,
   these considerations are valid for PSAMP exports as well.
   This method works by separating information common to several Flow
   Records from information specific to an individual Flow Record.
   Common Flow information is exported only once in a Data Record
   defined by an Options Template, while the rest of the specific Flow
   information is associated with the common information via a unique
   identifier.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The IPFIX working group has specified a protocol to export IP Flow
   information [RFC5101].  This protocol is designed to export
   information about IP traffic Flows and related measurement data,
   where a Flow is defined by a set of key attributes (e.g., source and
   destination IP address, source and destination port, etc.).  However,
   thanks to its template mechanism, the IPFIX protocol can export any
   type of information, as long as the Information Element is specified
   in the IPFIX information model [RFC5101] or registered with IANA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Regardless of the fields' contents, Flow Records with common
   properties export the same fields in every single Data Record.  These
   common properties may represent values common to a collection of
   Flows or packets, or values that are invariant over time.  Note that
   the common properties don't represent the list of Flow Keys, which
   are used to define a Flow definition; however, the common properties
   may contain some of the Flow Keys.  The reduction of redundant data
   from the export stream can result in a significant reduction of the
   transferred data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies a way to export these invariant or common
   properties only once, while the rest of the Flow-specific properties
   are exported in regular Data Records.  Unique common properties
   identifiers are used to link Data Records and the common attributes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The proposed method is applicable to IPFIX Flow and to PSAMP per-
   packet information, without any changes to both the IPFIX and PSAMP
   protocol specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   IPFIX Documents Overview</h3></a>

   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with
   access to IP Flow information.  The architecture for the export of
   measured IP Flow information out of an IPFIX exporting process to a
   collecting process is defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470],
   per the requirements defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917].  The IPFIX
   Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data Records and templates
   are carried via a congestion-aware transport protocol from IPFIX
   exporting processes to IPFIX collecting processes.  IPFIX has a
   formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, their names, types,
   and additional semantic information, as specified in the IPFIX
   information model [RFC5102].  Finally, the IPFIX applicability
   statement [RFC5472] describes what type of applications can use the
   IPFIX protocol and how they can use the information provided.  It
   furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework relates to other
   architectures and frameworks.
	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   PSAMP Documents Overview</h3></a>

   The document "A Framework for Packet Selection and Reporting"
   [RFC5474] describes the PSAMP framework for network elements to
   select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to
   export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a collector.
   The set of packet selection techniques (sampling, filtering, and
   hashing) supported by PSAMP is described in "Sampling and Filtering
   Techniques for IP Packet Selection" [RFC5475].  The PSAMP protocol
   [RFC5476] specifies the export of packet information from a PSAMP
   exporting process to a PSAMP collecting process.  Like IPFIX, PSAMP
   has a formal description of its Information Elements, their names,
   types, and additional semantic information.  The PSAMP information
   model is defined in [RFC5477].  Finally, [PSAMP-MIB] describes the
   PSAMP Management Information Base.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in
   Section 2 of the IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101] and Section 3
   of the PSAMP protocol specification [RFC5476].  As in [RFC5101] and
   [RFC5476], these IPFIX-specific terms have the first letter of a word
   capitalized when used in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, the following new terms are defined in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   commonPropertiesID:  The commonPropertiesID is an identifier of a set
      of common properties that is locally unique per Observation Domain
      and Transport Session.  Typically, this Information Element is
      used to link to information reported in separate Data Records.
      See the IPFIX information model [RFC5102] for the Information
      Element definition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Common Properties:  Common Properties are a collection of one or more
      attributes shared by a set of different Flow Records.  Each set of
      Common Properties is uniquely identifiable by means of a
      commonPropertiesID.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Specific Properties:  Specific Properties are a collection of one or
      more attributes reported in a Flow Record that are not included in
      the Common Properties defined for that Flow Record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   IPFIX Flows versus PSAMP Packets</h3></a>

   As described in the PSAMP protocol specification [RFC5476], the major
   difference between IPFIX and PSAMP is that the IPFIX protocol exports
   Flow Records while the PSAMP protocol exports Packet Records.  From a
   pure export point of view, IPFIX will not distinguish a Flow Record
   composed of several packets aggregated together from a Flow Record
   composed of a single packet.  So, the PSAMP export can be seen as a
   special IPFIX Flow Record containing information about a single
   packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For this document's clarity, the term Flow Record represents a
   generic term expressing an IPFIX Flow Record or a PSAMP Packet
   Record, as foreseen by its definition.  However, when appropriate, a
   clear distinction between Flow Record or Packet Record will be made.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Specifications for Bandwidth-Saving Information Export</h2></a>

   Several Flow Records often share a set of Common Properties.
   Repeating the information about these Common Properties for every
   Flow Record introduces a huge amount of redundancy.  This document
   proposes a method to reduce this redundancy.
   The PSAMP specifications are used for the export of per-packet
   information, exporting the specific observed packet in an IPFIX Flow
   Record.  This can be considered as a special Flow Record case,
   composed of a single packet.  Therefore, the method described in this
   document is also applicable to per-packet data reduction, e.g., for
   export of One-Way Delay (OWD) measurements (see Appendix), trajectory
   sampling, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Problem Statement and High-Level Solution</h3></a>

   Consider a set of properties "A", e.g., common sourceAddressA and
   sourcePortA, equivalent for each Flow Record exported.  Figure 1
   shows how this information is repeated with classical IPFIX Flow
   Records, expressing the waste of bandwidth to export redundant
   information.

        Figure 1: Common and Specific Properties Exported Together

   Figure 2 shows how this information is exported when applying the
   specifications of this document.  The Common Properties are separated
   from the Specific Properties for each Flow Record.  The Common
   Properties would be exported only once in a specific Data Record
   (defined by an Options Template), while each Flow Record contains a
   pointer to the Common Properties A, along with its Flow-specific
   information.  In order to maintain the relationship between these
   sets of properties, we introduce indices (in this case, the index for
   properties A) for the Common Properties that are unique for all
   Common Properties entries within an Observation Domain.  The purpose
   of the indices is to serve as a "key" identifying "rows" of the
   Common Properties table.  The rows are then referenced by the
   Specific Properties by using the appropriate value for the Common
   Properties identifier.
   +------------------------+-----------------+-------------+
   | index for properties A | sourceAddressA  | sourcePortA |
   +------------------------+-----------------+-------------+

   | index for properties A |     <Flow4 information>   |
   +------------------------+---------------------------+

       Figure 2: Common and Specific Properties Exported Separately

   This unique export of the Common Properties results in a decrease of
   the bandwidth requirements for the path between the Exporter and the
   Collector.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Data Reduction Technique</h3></a>

   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] is Template based.  Templates define how
   data should be exported, describing data fields together with their
   type and meaning.  IPFIX specifies two types of Templates: the
   Template Record and the Options Template Record.  The difference
   between the two is that the Options Template Record includes the
   notion of scope, defining how to scope the applicability of the Data
   Record.  The scope, which is only available in the Options Template
   Record, gives the context of the reported Information Elements in the
   Data Records.  The Template Records and Options Template Records are
   necessary to decode the Data Records.  Indeed, by only looking at the
   Data Records themselves, it is impossible to distinguish a Data
   Record defined by Template Record from a Data Record defined by an
   Options Template Record.  To export information more efficiently,
   this specification proposes to group Flow Records by their common
   properties.  We define Common Properties as a collection of
   attributes shared by a set of different Flow Records.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An implementation using the proposed specification MUST follow the
   IPFIX transport protocol specifications defined in the IPFIX protocol
   [RFC5101].
   As explained in Figure 3, the information is split into two parts,
   using two different Data Records.  Common Properties MUST be exported
   via Data Records defined by an Options Template Record.  Like
   Template Records, they MUST be sent only once per SCTP association or
   TCP connection, and MUST be sent reliably via SCTP if SCTP is the
   transport protocol.  These properties represent values common to
   several Flow Records (e.g., IP source and destination address).  The
   Common Properties Data Records MUST be sent prior to the
   corresponding Specific Properties Data Records.  The Data Records
   reporting Specific Properties MUST be associated with the Data
   Records reporting the Common Properties using a unique identifier for
   the Common Properties, the commonPropertiesID Information Element
   [RFC5102].  The commonPropertiesID Information Element MUST be
   included in the scope of the Options Template Record, and also
   included in the associated Template Record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +---------------------------+     +---------------------+

          Figure 3: Template Record and Data Record Dependencies

   From the IPFIX protocol, there are no differences between the per-
   Flow or per-packet data reduction, except maybe the terminology where
   the Specific Properties could be called packet Specific Properties in
   the previous figure.

   This document follows the IPFIX transport protocol specifications
   defined in the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101].  However, depending on the
   transport protocol choice, this document imposes some additional
   constraints.  If Partial Reliable Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (PR-SCTP) [RFC3758] is selected as the IPFIX protocol, the
   following PR-SCTP subsection specifications MUST be respected.  If
   UDP is selected as the IPFIX protocol, the following UDP subsection

   protocol, the following TCP subsection specifications MUST be
   respected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   PR-SCTP</h3></a>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Common Properties Data Records MUST be sent reliably.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   UDP</h3></a>

   Common Properties Data Records MUST be resent on a regular basis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   commonPropertiesID Management</h2></a>

   The commonPropertiesID is an identifier of a set of common properties
   that is locally unique per Observation Domain and Transport Session.
   The Exporting Process MUST manage the commonPropertiesIDs allocations
   for its Observation Domains and Transport Session.  Different
   Observation Domains from the same Exporter MAY use the same
   commonPropertiesID value to refer to different sets of Common
   Properties.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The commonPropertiesID values MAY be assigned sequentially, but it is

   If UDP is selected as the transport protocol, the Common Properties

   sourcePortA, and another set of properties "B", e.g.,

   The advantage of the multiple Common Properties is that the objective

   An Exporting Process MUST NOT export any set of Common Properties
   that contains, either directly or via other cascaded Common
   Properties, references to itself in its own definition (i.e., a
   circular definition).  When the Collecting Process receives Common
   Properties that reference other Common Properties, it MUST resolve
   the references to Common Properties.  If the Common Properties aren't
   available at the time Data Records are received, the Collecting
   Process SHOULD store the Data Records for a short period of time and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Export and Evaluation Considerations</h2></a>

   The objective of the method specified in this document is the
   reduction in the amount of measurement data that has to be
   transferred from the Exporter to the Collector.  Note that the
   efficiency of this method may vary, as discussed in this section.  In
   addition, there might be less storage capacity required at the
   Collector side if the Collector decides to store the Data Records as
   they arrive, without reconstructing the initial Flow Record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On the other hand, this method requires additional resources on both
   the Exporter and the Collector.  The Exporter has to manage Common
   Properties information and to assign commonPropertiesID values.  The
   Collector has to process records described by two templates instead
   of just one.  Additional effort is also required when post processing
   the measurement data, in order to correlate Flow Records with Common
   Properties information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.1"><h3>8.1   Transport Protocol Choice</h3></a>

   The proposed method is most effective using a reliable transport
   protocol for the transfer of the Common Properties.  Therefore, the
   use of PR-SCTP with full reliability or TCP is recommended for the
   transmission of IPFIX Messages containing Common Properties.  Note
   that use of UDP is less efficient for the transmission of Common
   Properties, as they have to be resent regularly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   Reduced Size Encoding</h3></a>

   The transfer of the commonPropertiesIDs originates some overhead and
   might even increase the amount of exported data if the length of the
   commonPropertiesID field is not shorter than the length of the
   replaced fields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In cases where the range of the commonPropertiesID can be restricted,
   it is RECOMMENDED to apply reduced size encoding to the
   commonPropertiesID to achieve a further gain in bandwidth efficiency.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.3"><h3>8.3   Efficiency Gain</h3></a>

   While the goal of this specification is to reduce the bandwidth, the
   efficiency might be limited.  Indeed, the efficiency gain is based on
   the abundance of redundant information in Flows and would be directly
   proportional to the reuse of the defined commonPropertiesID values,
   with a theoretical limit where all the Data Records would use a
   single commonPropertiesID.  In other words, the more we reuse a
   commonPropertiesID value, the better the efficiency gain.  While the
   Exporting Process can evaluate the direct gain for the Flow Records
   to be exported, it cannot predict whether future Flow Records would
   contain the information specified by active commonPropertiesID
   values.  This implies that the efficiency factor of this
   specification is higher for specific applications where filtering is
   involved, such as one-way delay or trajectory sampling.
   Note that this technique might even lead to an increase in bandwidth
   usage under certain conditions.  Taking into account the overhead of
   exporting the commonPropertiesID values, if the commonPropertiesID
   values are not used in future Data Records, this technique would
   actually increase the export bandwidth.  A typical case would be the
   assignments of Common Properties based on past observed traffic,
   hoping that future Flows would contain the same characteristics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The efficiency gain depends also on the difference between the length
   of the replaced fields and the length of the commonPropertiesID.  The
   shorter the length of the commonPropertiesID is (with respect to the
   total length of the Common Properties fields), the bigger the gain
   is.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The example in Appendix A.2 below uses IPFIX to export measurement
   data for each received packet.  In that case, for a Flow of 1000
   packets, the amount of data can be decreased more than 26 percent.

A.2.  Per-Packet Data Reduction

   An example of the per-packet data reduction is the measurement of
   One-Way Delay (OWD), where the exact same specific packet must be
   observed at the source and destination of the path to be measured.
   The OWD is computed by subtracting the time of observation of the
   same packet at the two end-points with synchronized clocks.  As the
   OWD is measured for a specific application on which a Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) is bound, this translates into the observation of
   multiple packets with Specific Properties.  In order to match the
   identical packet at both Observation Points, a series of packets with
   a set of properties (for example, all the packets of a specific
   source and destination IP addresses, of a specific Diffserv codepoint
   (DSCP) value, and of a specific destination transport port) must be
   observed at both ends of the measurements.  This implies that the
   source and destination must export a series of Flow Records composed
   of two types of information: some common information for all packets,
   and some unique information about each packet in order to generate a
   unique identifier for each packet passing this Observation Point (for
   example, a hash value on the invariant fields of the packet).  So,
   the source and destination composing the measurement's end-points can
   individually and independently apply the redundancy technique
   described in this document in order to save some bandwidth for their
   respective Flow Records exports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Templates required for exporting measurement data of this kind
   are illustrated in the figures below.  Figure 15 shows the Options
   Template containing the information concerning Flows using the
   commonPropertiesID as scope.  In the Common Properties Template, we
   export the following Information Elements:

               Figure 16: Example Packet Properties Template

   At the collection point, packet records from the two measurement
   points are gathered and correlated by means of the packet ID.  The
   resulting delay Data Records are exported in a similar manner as the
   packet data.  One-Way Delay data is associated with Flow information
   by the commonPropertiesID field.  The OWD properties contain the
   Packet Pair ID (which is the packet ID of the two contributing packet
   records), the timestamp of the packet passing the reference monitor
   point in order to reconstruct a time series, the calculated delay
   value, and the commonPropertiesID.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this example, using IPFIX to export the measurement data for each
   received packet, 38 bytes have to be transferred (sourceAddressV4=4,
   destinationAddressV4=4, classOfServiceV4=1, protocolIdentifier=1,
   sourceTransportPort=2, destinationTransportPort=2,
   observationTimeMilliseconds=8, digestHashValue=8, ipTotalLength=8).
   Without considering the IPFIX protocol overhead, a Flow of 1000
   packets produces 38000 bytes of measurement data.  Using the proposed
   optimization, each packet produces an export of only 28 bytes
   (observationTimeMilliseconds=8, digestHashValue=8, ipTotalLength=8,
   commonPropertiesID=4).  The export of the Flow information produces
   18 bytes (sourceAddressV4=4, destinationAddressV4=4,
   classOfServiceV4=1, protocolIdentifier=1, sourceTransportPort=2,
   destinationTransportPort=2, commonPropertiesID=4).  For a Flow of
   1000 packets, this sums to 28018 bytes.  This is a decrease of more
   than 26 percent.
