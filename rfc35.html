                            Network Meeting


     I expect to have the details of the new network protocol as
outlined in NWG/RFC #33 ready in two weeks.  Some interest has been
expressed in a live presentation, so we will host a network meeting on
Tuesday, March 17, at UCLA at 9:00 a.m.  To facilitate interaction,
please limit attendance to one programmer from each site.  It is also
wise to leave the 18th open in case discussion continues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     The subject of the meeting will be a detailed presentation of the
network protocol, suitable for implementing unless major flaws are
discovered.  Documentation will be available at the meeting and if not
obsoleted by the meeting, will be sent out as NWG/RFC on March 20.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Please call Mrs. Charlotte LaRoche at (213) 825-2543 if you need<br>
help in making arrangements.
