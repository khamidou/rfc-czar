</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo describes version 1.0 of the client/server interaction of
   RWhois.  RWhois provides a distributed system for the display of
   hierarchical information.  This system is hierarchical by design,
   allowing for the reduction of a query, and the referral of the user
   closer to the maintainer of the information.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Early in ARPANET development, the SRI-NIC established a centralized
   whois database that provided host and network information about the
   systems connected to the network and the E-mail addresses of the
   users on those systems.  The ARPANET experiment has evolved into a
   global network with countless people and hundreds of thousands of end
   systems.  Given the sheer size and effort needed to maintain a
   centralized database, an alternate, decentralized approach to store
   and display this information is desired.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Internet portions of the DDN NIC have been transitioned to what
   is now known as InterNIC Registration Services (RS).  The charter for
   InterNIC RS has been reduced to maintain information only for IP
   networks, top-level domains, Autonomous System Numbers, and the
   points of contact for each of these particular entities.  In
   addition, the InterNIC, in its role as an Internet Registry (IR), has
   delegated IP block assignment authority to Regional Registries such
   as the RIPE NCC for Europe and the APNIC for the Asian Pacific
   region, while retaining authority for North America and all non-
   delegated regions.  This has led to a fragmentation of whois service
   to the Internet user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Several different solutions have been proposed and developed by the
   various regional IR's.  Two solutions have been worked on
   extensively:  the Shared Whois Project (SWIP) and X.500.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SWIP project has a common exchange format that can be parsed by
   the various IR's for input and output.  Thus, one can synchronize
   their databases with information obtained from the other IR's.  This
   project is showing promise and is now operational.  However, this
   approach still requires a centralized database for store and display.
   The InterNIC has also been involved in the use of X.500 for display
   of registration information.  Among other things, this included
   defining schemas and Directory information tree structures for the
   purpose of distributing information amongst the various IR X.500
   Directory Service Agents (DSA).  Unfortunately, X.500's complexity,
   resource utilization, and lack of Internet support has made a search
   for an alternative solution necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The information that the various IR's maintain is inherently
   hierarchical in nature.  (Examples: hammer.nic.ddn.mil is under the
   nic.ddn.mil domain which is under the ddn.mil domain which is under
   the .mil domain. 198.41.0.21 is part of network 198.41.0.0/24 which
   is part of the block 198.41.0.0/16 which is part of the block
   198.0.0.0/8)  The InterNIC may not have the information, but will at
   least be able to reduce the query and point or refer the users closer
   to their goal.  This has led to the development of a referral whois,
   and the corresponding RWhois protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The underlying premise for this project has been to retain the basic
   functionality of the whois server and client, making all of the
   extensions optional.  The server must respond to the original whois
   client, currently included with many operating systems.  The RWhois
   client must also interact with RFC 954 [RFC-954] whois servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RWhois has been designed as an extensible protocol to ensure that
   many uses can be accommodated.  Public extensions to the protocol
   should be documented as RFCs.  Private extensions can be used with
   agreement left up to the client and server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If extensions are not implemented at the server in question, an
   appropriate error message must be sent.  The use of extended error
   message is outlined in Section 5 - Error Codes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Throughout this document the following notations will be used to
   describe the RWhois server/client interaction:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     <SP>      space
     [arg]     optional argument
     <arg>     required argument
     (<arg>)   conditional required argument
     ([arg])   conditional optional argument
     {format}  format of item
     \         continued on next line

   The words should and must are significant in this document.  If
   should is used, the implementor has the option to follow the advice
   of this document.  If must is used then it is a required part of the
   protocol.  Implementations without this functionality may not
   interact correctly with other RWhois servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The format descriptions throughout this document use macro
   definitions described in Section 6.1.  Refer to that section for
   clarification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RWhois protocol specified in this document can be extended to
   accommodate such applications as NetHelp and ZoneGen (DNS zone
   generator).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   RWhois Client Model</h2></a>

   The RWhois design requires compatibility with the current Whois and
   Whois++ servers.  Therefore, the RWhois client must wait or have
   knowledge of server type to determine if the server contacted is an
   RWhois server.  The user should have control over the time the client
   waits, since this will vary based on network congestion and capacity.
   If after the wait the server does not respond with the %RWhois
   response, the client must not send any RWhois extended directives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this case, the client should only send the query.  We realize that
   the server identification feature may mean that the identity of an
   RWhois server may be missed.  However, it will allow the RWhois
   system to utilize the current Whois and Whois++ infrastructure.
   Referrals from RWhois can be directed toward a Whois or Whois++
   server.  These non-RWhois servers must be placed as a leaf on the
   hierarchical tree.  These servers represent a mesh structure from the
   RWhois perspective.  This restriction should not discourage the use
   of these servers in building the RWhois structure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RWhois server must remain connected until a query is received.
   If the client wishes to make multiple queries it must send the
   -holdconnect directive.  In this mode, once the client has sent the
   last query and received either an answer or the error code indicating
   that no records were found, it must issue the -quit directive.  If
   the client only wishes to issue directives, then upon completion the
   -quit directive must be sent.  If it is not sent, the server will
   wait until it receives non-directive input from the client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Considering the requirement for compatibility with the original
   whois, the RWhois client in default mode must operate exactly like
   the current Whois client.  However, in the enhanced mode, the RWhois
   client can do much more based on information received from the RWhois
   server.
	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Directives:  Client to Server Interaction</h3></a>

   The RWhois client sends directives to the RWhois server. These
   directives are prefaced with the `-' character always at the start of
   a new line.  However, for compatibility with older Whois clients, the
   query is not prefaced with the `-' character. Only after the client
   is certain that the server is an RWhois server should these
   directives be sent.  Compatibility with RFC 954 [RFC-954] whois
   servers is required.  All directives must be terminated by <LF><CR>.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Required Directives</h3></a>

   The following are required RWhois client directives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.1"><h4>2.2.1  <query></h4></a>

   The query is generally the final directive sent to the server.  It is
   the only directive that does not start with a `-'.  The query is the
   question that the client wants the server to answer.  The qualifiers
   that may proceed the query are addressed in Section 3.1 - Output
   Display and Restriction Keywords.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Format for use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [display format]<SP>[query restriction]<SP><query>

   [Display format]{%s}     This optional pre-query directive allows
                            the requester to select the format of
                            the returned data.  Details of the
                            allowable values can be found in Section
                            3.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [Query restriction]{%s}  This optional pre-query directive allows
                            the requester to limit the area in which
                            the servers search for a specific
                            object.

	<a name="section-2.2.2"><h4>2.2.2  RWhois</h4></a>

   The -RWhois directive identifies the client as an RWhois client
   allowing the server to operate using the RWhois protocol exclusively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Format for use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -RWhois<SP>V-<spec version #><SP>[imp identifier]

   <Spec version #>{%2d.%2d}     This required argument identifies
                                 the specification version that the
                                 client is built to conform with.
                                 Clients that are built in
                                 accordance with this document are
                                 V-1.0.  This argument will be used
                                 by the server to determine if
                                 features introduced in subsequent
                                 releases of the protocol document
                                 may be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [Imp identifier]{%s}  This optional argument identifies client
                         implementation information.  It is
                         recommended that the implementor maintain a
                         version number separate from the
                         specification version.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example of use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -RWhois V-1.0 [InterNIC B.0.9.7]

	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Optional Directives</h3></a>

   The following are OPTIONAL RWhois server directives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.1"><h4>2.3.1  load</h4></a>

   The -load directive allows the client to make a quick decision about
   presenting the query to the current server.  If the client determines
   that another server can better serve the query, then control may be
   transferred to the server with the lower load and better connection.
   This directive has no arguments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.2"><h4>2.3.2  limit</h4></a>

   The -limit directive will allow the client to request the server
   allocate enough space to collect more responses than would currently
   be collected by the server.
   Format for use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -limit<SP><value>

   <Value>{%d}  This required argument is the new limit requested by
                the client.  If the limit exceeds the limit set by
                the server administrator, the client must receive an
                error message.  It is recommended that if the client
                receives an error for exceeding the servers upper
                limit, it should cut the request in half and resend
                the request until an acceptable level has been
                negotiated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example of use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -limit 2000

	<a name="section-2.3.3"><h4>2.3.3  schema</h4></a>

   One of the shortcomings of X.500 was the requirement to know the
   schema of an object before making a query.  RWhois allows the client
   to request the schema for an object without knowledge of the object
   by using the -schema directive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Format for use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -schema<SP>[object]

   [object]{%s}   This optional argument identifies the objects for
                  which the schema is being requested.  If this
                  argument is not sent, the schemas for all objects
                  contained in the server will be sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example of use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -schema domain

	<a name="section-2.3.4"><h4>2.3.4  xfer</h4></a>

   The -xfer directive is used to transfer all data from a server.  This
   method of transfer has no limit on the number of records that can be
   transferred to the client application.  This directive is primarily
   used to transfer data contained in an authority area for caching at a
   secondary server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Format for use:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -xfer<SP>[object]<SP>[authority area]<SP>[SOA]
   [Object]{All|%s}       This required argument identifies the
                          object to transfer.  If the keyword all
                          is sent, all objects contained in the
                          server will be transferred.  Otherwise,
                          only the object specified will be sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [Authority area]{%s}   This optional argument contains the
                          authority area of the object to send
                          further limiting the data transfer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [SOA]{%d}              This optional argument notifies the server
                          to send everything that has been updated

   unknown attributes.  This directive has no arguments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.7"><h4>2.3.7  cache</h4></a>

   The RWhois server can hold data that it has no authority over.  If
   the server sends this data to a requester, it is considered a non-
   authoritative response.  The holding of this data is called caching.
   The physical data for these objects is not contained on the system
   hosting the server.  The -cache directive allows the client to
   instruct the server whether or not to send cached data.  The RWhois
   client should start with the cache turned off.  The server must start
   with the cache turned on in order to function like the RFC 954 [RFC-
   954] whois server.  Because of the server's default, the client
   should send the -cache off directive during initial session setup if
   cached data should not be sent.  Details on expiration of cache data
   can be found in section 3.4.3, %soa response.

   the -holdconnect directive.  If this directive is issued to the
   RWhois sever, it will remain connected until the -quit directive is
   received.  Once the -quit directive is received, both the server and

   badref    When a client receives a %referral response that does
             not work, it must report the bad referral to the server
             that issued the referral.  The referral is bad only if
             the referred server does not contain the SOA record for
             the authority area in question. It is not considered a
             bad referral if the server does not have an answer to
             the query, but responds positively to the -soa area
             directive.  This merely means that there is not an
             answer to the query.  When a -badref is sent to the
             referring server; it should log the bad referral so the
             administrator of that server can remove the reference
             if it is no longer correct.  This action should only be

      Data Restriction Format Keywords
      The following restriction keywords are found in the RFC 954
      [RFC-954] whois server:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   !(handle) Query on Handle only
   mailbox   Query on all records for person
   person    Query on User records only
   host      Query on Host records only
   domain    Query on Domain records only
   network   Query on Network Records only
   asn       Query on Autonomous System Numbers only

   The RWhois server must allow restriction of search to any object
   contained on that server.  With the exception of the `!' restriction
   format keyword, the above listed restriction keywords represent
   defined objects.  In the prototype software, each of these objects
   are defined in configuration files, not hard-coded into the server.
   New objects, and therefore restriction keywords, should be easily
   designed with no code change necessary to the server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Responses:  Server to Client Interaction</h3></a>

   Responses are sets of data that servers send in response to a client
   directive.  Responses from an RWhois server must be prefaced with the
   `%' character at the start of a line.  Responses are divided into two
   groups:  those that are required to provide minimal RWhois
   interaction and those that are used to achieve the desired
   characteristics of a fully functional distributed system.  A server
   must respond with an error message indicating that a directive is not
   available on the server and therefore does not have the required
   responses.
	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Required Responses</h3></a>

   The following sections describe the required RWhois server responses.

	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2  referral</h4></a>

   The %referral response instructs the client to query another server
   (which could be a whois, RWhois, or whois++ server).  Referrals are
   cumulative.  The first referral received during a session must
   replace the default server list.  Any subsequent referrals received
   must be appended to the end of the server list.
   In the non-Uniform Resource Location (URL) response format below, the
   authority area equals the reduced query.  There are three types of
   referral.  The type can be determined by the client evaluating the
   authority area which is part of the %referral response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the authority area received from a referral response is equal to
   the original query, then it is a link type referral.  If the
   authority area is not equal to the query, then it is a reduction type
   referral.  If no authority area is sent, then it is a punt type
   referral. (Punt means the server is not a root and cannot answer the
   query and therefore is referring the client to a level up the tree or
   to a server that can better answer the query.) [NOTE:  the punt type
   referral may be used to direct a client into the whois++ mesh type.]

   The client may receive multiple referrals from a single query.  If
   the SOA for each of these referrals is the same, then the first
   referral is the primary server and all subsequent servers are
   secondary.  Each of the servers will report the SOA for the authority
   area in question.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Format Specification Macros</h3></a>

   Format specifications may be presented as macros.  Format
   specification macros may be defined using the following format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   %M<macro name>=<format string or earlier macro>

   The following macros are pre-defined in this RWhois specification:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Month/Day/Year formats:
   %MM=[%-2d[0-12]]
   %MD=[%-2d[0-31]]
   %MY2=[%-2d[0-99]]
   %MY4=[%-4d[0-9999]]
   %MMs=[%-3s\
   ["JAN","FEB","MAR","APR","MAY","JUN","JUL","AUG","SEP",\
   "OCT","NOV","DEC"]]

   Date formats:
   %Mdate1=[%MM/%MD/%MY2]
   %Mdate2=[%MM/%MD/%MY4]
   %Mdate3=[%MD-%MMs-%MY2]
   %Mdate4=[%MD-%MMs-%MY4]
   %Mdate5=[%MY4%MM%MD]

   Hour/Minute/Second formats:
   %MTH=[%-2d[0-24]]
   %MTM=[%-2d[0-59]]
   %MTS=[%-2d[0-59]]

   Time formats:
   %Mtime1=[%MTH:%MTM:%MTS]
   %Mtime2=[%MTH%MTM%MTS]

   Miscellaneous formats:
   %Mserver=[%s:%16Bd]
   %Mipnumber=[%8Bd.%8Bd.%8Bd.%8Bd]
   %Memail=[%s@%s]

   %Mserial=[%Mdate5%Mtime2]
   %Mstype=[RWHOIS/WHOIS/WHOIS++/OTHER]
   %Murl=[%s://%s]

   Macro definitions may be obtained by sending the -define directive to
   the server.  For client efficiency, definitions can be remembered.
   If the definition of a macro changes, the serial number of all
   schemas using that macro must change, allowing the client to
   reacquire the schema and format specifier macros.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Quick Query (RWhois using UDP)</h2></a>

   The overhead incurred by establishing a TCP connection and
   interacting with an RWhois server may be unnecessary if the client
   only wishes to ask one question.  A separate document will describe
   the UDP facility for RWhois.  Adjustments to the query must be made
   to make this a practical option.  The only function allowed while
   utilizing UDP is a single query.
