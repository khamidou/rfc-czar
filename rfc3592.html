   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Synchronous Optical
   Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) interfaces.  This
   document is a companion to the documents that define Managed Objects
   for the DS1/E1/DS2/E2 and DS3/E3 Interface Types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo replaces RFC 2558.  Changes relative to RFC 2558 are
   summarized in the MIB module's REVISION clause.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a SONET/SDH interface.  At present, this
   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-
   standard MIB:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      sonet (39), sonetPath (50), sonetVT (51)<br>

   The definitions contained herein are based on the SONET/SDH
   specifications in ANSI T1.105 and T1.106-1988
   [T1.105a][T1.105b][T1.106] and CCITT G.707, 708, 709, and G.783
   [G.707][G.708][G.709][G.783].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Use of the ifTable</h3></a>

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   [RFC2863], is used for SONET/SDH interfaces.  The SONET/SDH layers
   support several multiplexing possibilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example in SONET, an Synchronous Transport Signal 3 (STS-3) has 3
   SONET Paths, and a STS-3c has 1 SONET Path.  Another example could be
   a STS-12 having 4 SONET STS-3c Paths.  Similarly, a SONET Synchronous
   Payload Envelope (SPE) can carry many Virtual Tributaries (VTs), for
   example, one SONET SPE can carry 28 VT1.5s.  It is important to note
   that an SPE and a VT in SONET is collectively referred to as a
   Virtual Container (VC) in SDH.  Also, an STS is called Synchronous
   Transport Module (STM) in SDH.
   Not all SONET/SDH equipment terminates all SONET/SDH layers. For
   example, a SONET/SDH STE regenerator terminates SONET/SDH Sections
   only, and is transparent for all layers above that. SONET/SDH Add-
   Drop multiplexers and Digital Cross Connect Systems terminate
   SONET/SDH Lines.  SONET/SDH Terminal Multiplexers may also terminate
   SONET/SDH Paths and VTs/VCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MIB II [RFC1213], as extended by [RFC2863], accommodates these cases
   by appropriate use of the MIB II system group, and the interfaces
   group.  The system group can name and describe the type of managed
   resource.  The interfaces group defines which SONET/SDH layers apply,
   how these layers are configured and multiplexed.  This is achieved by
   proper representation of SONET/SDH Layers by ifEntries as defined in
   [RFC2863], as follows:

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a SONET circuit as monitored by a SONET system are from the T1.231
   [T1M1.3][T1.231a][T1.231b].  The terminology used in this document to
   describe error conditions on a SDH circuit as monitored by a SDH
   system are from the CCITT G.783 [G.783].  Only the SONET Performance
   Monitoring terminology is defined in this document.  The definitions
   for SDH Performance Monitoring terms are similar but not identical,
   and they can be found in [G.783].  If the definition in this document
   does not match the definition in the T1.231 document, the implementer
   should follow the definition described in this document.  In some
   cases other or additional references are used as compared with the
   ones cited above.  This will be indicated in the text.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section Loss Of Frame Failure (Out of Frame Event, Severely
      Errored Frame Defect) An Out of Frame (OOF) event (or Severely
      Errored Frame defect) is the occurrence of four contiguous errored
      frame alignment words.  A frame alignment word occupies the A1 and
      A2 bytes of an STS frame, and is defined in T1.105.  The SEF
      defect is terminated when two contiguous error-free frame words
      are detected.  Any implementation of the frame recovery circuitry
      which achieves realignment following an OOF within the 250
      microsecond (two frames) interval implied by this definition is
      acceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A Loss of Frame (LOF) defect is declared when an OOF/SEF defect
      persists for a period of 3 milliseconds.  The LOF defect is
      terminated when the incoming signal remains continuously in-frame
      for a period of 1 ms to 3 ms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A LOF failure is declared when the LOF defect persists for a
      period of 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds, except when an LOS defect or
      failure is present.  The LOF failure is cleared when the LOS
      failure is declared, or when the LOF defect is absent for 10 +/-
      0.5 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Loss of Signal
      The Loss of Signal (LOS) defect is declared when no transitions
      are detected on the incoming signal (before descrambling).  The
      LOS defect is detected  upon observing 2.3 to 100 microseconds of
      no transitions.  The LOS defect is cleared after a 125 microsecond
      interval (one frame) during which no LOS defect is detected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The LOS failure is declared when the LOS defect persists for a
      period of 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds, or if LOS defect is present when
      the criteria for LOF failure declaration have been met.  The LOS
      failure is cleared when the LOS defect is absent for a period of
      10 +/- 0.5 seconds.  Declaration of LOS failure clears any
      existing LOF failure.  Clearing the LOS failure allows immediate
      declaration of the LOF failure if conditions warrant.
   STS-Path Loss of Pointer
      A Loss of Pointer (LOP) defect is declared when either a valid
      pointer is not detected in eight consecutive frames, or when eight
      consecutive frames are detected with the New Data Flag (NDF) set
      to "1001" without a valid concatenation indicator (see ANSI
      T1.105).  A LOP defect is terminated when either a valid pointer
      with a normal NDF set to "0110", or a valid concatenation
      indicator is detected for three contiguous frames.  Incoming STS-
      Path AIS shall not result in the declaration of a LOP defect.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An STS-Path LOP failure is declared when the STS-Path LOP defect
      persists for a period of 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds.  A STS-Path LOP

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   VT-Path Alarm Indication Signal
      The VT-Path Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) is only applicable for

      Path AIS, an STS PTE will generate downstream VT-Path AIS if the
      STS Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) is carrying floating VTs.
      VT-Path AIS is specified in ANSI T1.105 as all ones in bytes V1,
      V2, V3, and V4, as well as all ones in the entire VT SPE.  The

      RDI defects are detected for 10 +/- 0.5 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   VT-Path Remote Failure Indication
      The VT-Path RFI signal is only required for the case of byte synch
      mapped DS1s where the DS1 frame bit is not mapped.  The VT-Path
      RFI is specified in ANSI T1.105, where it is currently called VT
      path yellow.  When provided, the VT-Path RFI signal is used to
      indicate the occurrence of far-end failures.  When the VT-Path RFI
      is not provided, far-end failures are derived from local timing of
      the VT-Path RDI defect.  The VT-Path RFI failure is declared
      within 5 ms of detecting the incoming VT-Path RFI Signal.  The
      VT-Path Remote Failure Indication (RFI) failure is cleared within
      50 ms of detecting the removal of the incoming VT-Path RFI signal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Coding Violation
      Coding Violations (CV) are Bit Interleaved Parity (BIP) errors
      that are detected in the incoming signal.  CV counters are
      incremented for each BIP error detected.  That is, each BIP-8 can
      detect up to eight errors per STS-N frame, with each error
      incrementing the CV counter.  Section CVs shall be collected using
      the BIP-8 in the B1 byte located in the Section Overhead of STS-1
      #1.  Line CVs shall be collected using the BIP-8s in B2 bytes
      located in the Line Overhead of each STS-1 (since all CVs on an
      STS-N line are counted together, this is equivalent to counting
      each error in the BIP-8*N contained in the B2 bytes of the STS-N
      Line Overhead).  Thus, on an STS-N signal, up to 8 x N CVs may
      occur in each frame.  Path CVs shall be collected using the BIP-8
      in the B3 byte of the STS-Path Overhead of the STS SPE.  VT CVs
      shall be collected using the BIP-2 in the V5 overhead byte of the
      floating VT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Errored Seconds
      At each layer, an Errored Second (ES) is a second with one or more
      Coding Violations at that layer OR one or more incoming defects
      (e.g., SEF, LOS, AIS, LOP) at that layer has occurred.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Severely Errored Seconds
      According to [T1M1.3][T1.231a][TR253][GR253][T1.231b] at each
      layer, an Severely Errored Second (SES) is a second with x or more
      CVs at that layer, or a second during which at least one or more
      incoming defects at that layer has occurred.  The values of x in
      RFC 1595 [RFC1595] were based on [T1M1.3] and [TR253] (see
      Appendix B).  These values have subsequently been relaxed in
      [T1.231a][GR253][T1.231b].  In addition, according to G.826
      [G.826] SESs are measured as a percentage of errored blocks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To deal with these sets of definitions this memo defines an object
      sonetSESthresholdSet that determines the correct interpretation of

      Otherwise, a more recent interpretation is suggested.  An agent is
      not required to support all sets of definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that CV counts should be frozen during SESs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Severely Errored Framing Seconds
      A Severely Errored Framing Second (SEFS) is a second containing
      one or more SEF events.  This counter is only counted at the
      Section Layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unavailable Seconds
      At the Line, Path, and VT layers, an unavailable second is
      calculated by counting the number of seconds that the interface is
      unavailable.  At each layer, the SONET/SDH interface is said to be
      unavailable at the onset of 10 contiguous SESs.  The 10 SESs are
      included in unavailable time.  Once unavailable, the SONET/SDH
      interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds
      with no SESs.  The 10 seconds with no SESs are excluded from
      unavailable time.  With respect to the SONET/SDH error counts at
      each layer, all counters at that layer are incremented while the
      SONET/SDH interface is deemed available at that layer.  While the
      interface is deemed unavailable at that layer, the only count that
      is incremented is UASs at that layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that this definition implies that the agent cannot determine
      until after a ten second interval has passed whether a given one-
      second interval belongs to available or unavailable time.  If the
      agent chooses to update the various performance statistics in real
      time then it must be prepared to retroactively reduce the ES, SES,
      and SEFS counts by 10 and increase the UAS count by 10 when it
      determines that available time has been entered.  It must also be
      prepared to reduce the CV count by the number of violations
      counted since the onset of unavailable time.  The agent must be
      similarly prepared to retroactively decrease the UAS count by 10
      and increase the ES and CV counts as necessary upon entering
      available time.  A special case exists when the 10 second period
      leading to available or unavailable time crosses a 900 second
      statistics window boundary, as the foregoing description implies
      that the CV, ES, SES, SEFS, and UAS counts the PREVIOUS interval
      must be adjusted.  In this case successive GETs of the affected
      sonetPathIntervalSES and sonetPathIntervalUAS objects (and the
      analogous Line and VT objects also) objects will return differing
      values if the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the
      window.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the _onset_ of
      10 contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable
      time starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous SESs.  Also,
      while an interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that
      interface are frozen except for the UAS count.  It follows that an
      implementation which strictly complies with this standard must
      _not_ increment any counters other than the UAS count -- even
      temporarily -- as a result of anything that happens during those
      10 seconds.  Since changes in the signal state lag the data to
      which they apply by 10 seconds, an ANSI-compliant implementation
      must pass the one-second statistics through a 10-second delay line
      prior to updating any counters.  That can be done by performing
      the following steps at the end of each one second interval.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status flags from the
           hardware.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the preceding second and compare
           them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer in question.
           Update the signal state and shift the one-second CV counts
           and ES/SES flags into the 10-element delay line.  Note that
           far-end one-second statistics are to be flagged as "absent"
           during any second in which there is an incoming defect at the
           layer in question or at any lower layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal state
           from the _previous_ update cycle and the one-second CV counts
           and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element delay line.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This approach is further described in Appendix A.  An agent may
      choose to use this approach in lieu of retroactive adjustments to
      the counters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In any case, a linkDown trap shall be sent only after the agent
      has determined for certain that the unavailable state has been
      entered, but the time on the trap will be that of the first UAS
      (i.e., 10 seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall be handled
      similarly.
   Unequipped
      If a Path or VT connection is not provisioned (idle) the SONET
      equipment will signal this state by transmitting the Path or VT
      Signal Label as follows:  - byte C2 of the STS Path Overhead equal
      to 0 for an unequipped Path, - byte V5 of the VT Path Overhead
      equal to 0 for an unequipped VT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Signal Label Mismatch
      A Path or VT connection is not correctly provisioned if a received
      Path or VT Signal Label mismatch occurs.  A received Signal Label
      is considered mismatched if it does not equal either the locally
      provisioned value or the value 'equipped non-specific' (1 hex).
      Note that any received non-zero Signal Label is considered a
      locally provisioned value of 'equipped non-specific'.  Only in-
      service, provisioned Path Terminating equipment can detect
      mismatched Signal labels.  It is considered provisioned if it has
      been configured for a mapping and has been assigned signals to and
      from which the mapping takes place.  While a Path is unequipped or
      has mismatched signal labels ES/SES counts continue, but these
      conditions do not themselves contribute to ES/SES.

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Acknowledgments</h2></a>

   This specification is a product of the AToM MIB Working Group.  The
   author would like to acknowledge Mike Heard for his many valuable
   contributions to this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write:  sonetMediumType,
   sonetMediumLineCoding, sonetMediumLineType,
   sonetMediumCircuitIdentifier, sonetMediumLoopbackConfig,
   sonetSESthresholdSet, sonetPathCurrentWidth, and sonetVTCurrentWidth.
   It is possible for writes to these objects to have disruptive effects
   on network operation that range from invalid performance data to
   traffic interruptions.  Users of this MIB module must therefore be
   aware that support for SET operations in a non-secure environment
   without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., the objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide extensive
   information about the performance of interfaces in SONET/SDH
   equipment or networks and can reveal some aspects of their
   configuration.  In such environments it is important to control even
   GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to encrypt the
   values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

Appendix A:  The delay-line approach to statistics collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the onset of 10
   contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable time
   starts with the first of the 10 contiguous SESs -- and while an
   interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are
   frozen except for the UAS count.  Since changes in the signal state
   lag the data to which they apply by 10 seconds, an implementation
   which wishes to avoid making retroactive adjustments to the counts
   must pass the the one-second statistics through a 10-second delay
   line prior to updating any counters.  That can be done by performing
   the following steps at the end of each one second interval.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   i)   Read near/far end line and path CV counts and alarm status flags
        from the hardware.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the preceding second and compare
        them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer in question.
        Update the signal state and shift the one-second CV counts and
        ES/SES flags into the 10-element delay line.  Note that far-end
        one-second statistics are to be flagged as "absent" during any
        second in which there is an incoming defect at the layer in
        question or at any lower layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal state
        from the previous update cycle and the one-second CV counts and
        ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element delay line.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This procedure guarantees that the statistical counters will be
   correctly updated at all times, although they lag real time by 10
   seconds.  It is illustrated in the figure below.  At the end of each
   15 minutes interval the current interval counts are transferred to
   the  most recent interval entry and each interval is shifted up by
   one position, with the oldest being discarded if necessary in order
   to make room.  The current interval counts then start over from zero.
   Note, however, that the signal state calculation does not start anew
   at each interval boundary;  rather, signal state information is
   retained across interval boundaries.<pre>
