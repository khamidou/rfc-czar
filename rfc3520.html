   This document describes the representation of a session authorization
   policy element for supporting policy-based per-session authorization
   and admission control.  The goal of session authorization is to allow
   the exchange of information between network elements in order to
   authorize the use of resources for a service and to co-ordinate
   actions between the signaling and transport planes.  This document
   describes how a process on a system authorizes the reservation of
   resources by a host and then provides that host with a session
   authorization policy element which can be inserted into a resource
   reservation protocol (e.g., the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)
   PATH message) to facilitate proper and secure reservation of those
   resources within the network.  We describe the encoding of session
   authorization information as a policy element conforming to the
   format of a Policy Data object (RFC 2750) and provide details
   relating to operations, processing rules and error scenarios.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Introduction</h2></a>

   RSVP [RFC-2205] is one example of a resource reservation protocol
   that is used by a host to request specific services from the network
   for particular application data streams or flows.  RSVP requests will
   generally result in resources being reserved in each router along the
   data path.  RSVP allows users to obtain preferential access to
   network resources, under the control of an admission control
   mechanism.  Such admission control is often based on user or
   application identity [RFC-3182], however, it is also valuable to
   provide the ability for per-session admission control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to allow for per-session admission control, it is necessary
   to provide a mechanism for ensuring use of resources by a host has
   been properly authorized before allowing the reservation of those
   resources.  In order to meet this requirement, there must be
   information in the resource reservation message which may be used to
   verify the validity of the reservation request.  This can be done by
   providing the host with a session authorization policy element which
   is inserted into the resource reservation message and verified by the
   network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes the session authorization policy element
   (AUTH_SESSION) used to convey information about the resources
   authorized for use by a session.  The host must obtain an
   AUTH_SESSION element from an authorizing entity via a session
   signaling protocol such as SIP [RFC-3261].  The host then inserts the
   AUTH_SESSION element into the resource reservation message to allow
   verification of the network resource request; in the case of RSVP,
   this element MUST be encapsulated in the Policy Data object [RFC-
   2750] of an RSVP PATH message.  Network elements verify the request
   and then process the resource reservation message based on admission
   policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC-3521] describes a framework in which a session authorization
   policy element may be utilized to contain information relevant to the
   network's decision to grant a reservation request.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Policy Element for Session Authorization</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Policy Data Object Format</h3></a>

   The Session Authorization policy element conforms to the format of a
   POLICY_DATA object which contains policy information and is carried
   by policy based admission protocols such as RSVP.  A detailed
   description of the POLICY_DATA object can be found in "RSVP
   Extensions for Policy Control" [RFC-2750].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Session Authorization Policy Element</h3></a>

   In this section we describe a policy element (PE) called session
   authorization (AUTH_SESSION).  The AUTH_SESSION policy element
   contains a list of fields which describe the session, along with
   other attributes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><pre>          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
          | Length                    | P-Type = AUTH_SESSION     |
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
          // Session Authorization Attribute List                //
          +-------------------------------------------------------+

   Length: 16 bits
      The length of the policy element (including the Length and P-Type)
      is in number of octets (MUST be in multiples of 4) and indicates
      the end of the session authorization information block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   P-Type: 16 bits (Session Authorization Type)
      AUTH_SESSION = 0x04
      The Policy element type (P-type) of this element.  The Internet
      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for policy
      element types as described in [RFC-2750].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Session Authorization Attribute List: variable length
      The session authorization attribute list is a collection of
      objects which describes the session and provides other information
      necessary to verify the resource reservation request. An initial
      set of valid objects is described in Section 3.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3  Session Authorization Attributes</h3></a>

   A session authorization attribute may contain a variety of
   information and has both an attribute type and subtype.  The
   attribute itself MUST be a multiple of 4 octets in length, and any
   attributes that are not a multiple of 4 octets long MUST be padded to
   a 4-octet boundary.  All padding bytes MUST have a value of zero.
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
      | Length          | X-Type |SubType |
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
      | Value ...
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   Length: 16 bits
      The length field is two octets and indicates the actual length of
      the attribute (including Length, X-Type and SubType fields) in
      number of octets.  The length does NOT include any bytes padding
      to the value field to make the attribute a multiple of 4 octets
      long.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   X-Type: 8 bits
      Session authorization attribute type (X-Type) field is one octet.
      IANA acts as a registry for X-Types as described in section 7,
      IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry contains the
      following X-Types:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1  AUTH_ENT_ID          The unique identifier of the entity which
                              authorized the session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SubType: 8 bits
      Session authorization attribute sub-type is one octet in length.
      The value of the SubType depends on the X-Type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Value: variable length
      The attribute specific information.
	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1  Authorizing Entity Identifier</h4></a>

   AUTH_ENT_ID is used to identify the entity which authorized the
   initial service request and generated the session authorization
   policy element.  The AUTH_ENT_ID may be represented in various
   formats, and the SubType is used to define the format for the ID. The
   format for AUTH_ENT_ID is as follows:

   An authorizing entity is configured to construct the AUTH_SESSION
   policy element that designates use of the Kerberos authentication
   method (KRB_PRINCIPAL) as defined in RFC 1510.  Upon reception of the
   resource reservation request, the router/PDP contacts the local KDC,
   with a KRB_AS_REQ message, to request credentials for the authorizing
   entity (principal@realm).  In this request, the client (router/PDP)
   sends (in cleartext) its own identity and the identity of the server
   (the authorizing entity taken from the AUTH_ENT_ID field) for which
   it is requesting credentials.  The local KDC responds with these
   credentials in a KRB_AS_REP message, encrypted in the client's key.
   The credentials consist of 1) a "ticket" for the server and 2) a
   temporary encryption key (often called a "session key").  The
   router/PDP uses the ticket to access the authorizing entity with a
   KRB_AP_REQ message.  The session key (now shared by the router/PDP
   and the authorizing entity) is used to authenticate the router/PDP,
   and is used to authenticate the authorizing entity.  The session key
   is an encryption key and is also used to encrypt further
   communication between the two parties.  The authorizing entity
   responds by sending a concatenated message of a KRB_AP_REP and a
   KRB_SAFE.  The KRB_AP_REP is used to authenticate the authorizing
   entity.  The KRB_SAFE message contains the authentication data in the
   safe-body field.  The authentication data must be either a 16 byte
   MD5 hash or 20 byte SHA-1 hash of all data in the AUTH_SESSION policy
   element up to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA (note that when using Kerberos
   the AUTH_SESSION PE should not include AUTHENTICATION_DATA as this is
   sent in the KRB_SAFE message).  The router/PDP independently computes
   the hash, and compares it with the received hash in the user-data
   field of the KRB-SAFE-BODY [RFC-1510].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At a minimum, all AUTH_SESSION implementations using Kerberos MUST
   support the Kerberos des-cbc-md5 encryption type [RFC-1510] (for
   encrypted data in tickets and Kerberos messages) and the Kerberos
   rsa-md5-des checksum type [RFC-1510] (for the KRB_SAFE checksum)
   checksum.  New algorithms may be added by the IETF standards process.
   Triple-DES encryption is supported in many Kerberos implementations
   (although not specified in [RFC-1510]), and SHOULD be used over
   single DES.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For cases where the authorizing entity is in a different realm (i.e.,
   administrative domain, organizational boundary), the router/PDP needs
   to fetch a cross-realm Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from its local

   the KDC in the remote realm.  Note that for performance
   considerations, tickets are typically cached for extended periods.

      obtained securely.  An example of insecure access control

   return a policy control failure (Error Code = 02) to the PEP.  The
   error values are described in [RFC-2205] and [RFC-2750].  Also the
   PDP SHOULD supply a policy data object containing an AUTH_DATA Policy
   Element with A-Type=POLICY_ERROR_CODE containing more details on the

   MUST include this Policy Data object in the outgoing RSVP Error

	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The purpose of this document is to describe a mechanism for session
   authorization to prevent theft of service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Replay attacks MUST be prevented.  In the non-associated model, the
   AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST include a START_TIME field and the
   Policy Servers MUST support NTP to ensure proper clock
   synchronization.  Failure to ensure proper clock synchronization will
   allow replay attacks since the clocks of the different network
   entities may not be in-synch.  The start time is used to verify that
   the request is not being replayed at a later time.  In all other
   models, the SESSION_ID is used by the Policy Server to ensure that
   the resource request successfully correlates with records of an
   authorized session.  If a AUTH_SESSION is replayed, it MUST be
   detected by the policy server (using internal algorithms) and the
   request MUST be rejected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To ensure that the integrity of the policy element is preserved in
   untrusted environments, the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute MUST be
   included.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In environments where shared symmetric keys are possible, they should
   be used in order to keep the AUTH_SESSION policy element size to a
   strict minimum.  This is especially true in wireless environments
   where the AUTH_SESSION policy element is sent
   over-the-air.  The shared symmetric keys authentication option MUST
   be supported by all AUTH_SESSION implementations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If shared symmetric keys are not a valid option, the Kerberos
   authentication mechanism is reasonably well secured and efficient in
   terms of AUTH_SESSION size.  The AUTH_SESSION only needs to contain
   the principal@realm name of the authorizing entity.  This is much
   more efficient than the PKI authentication option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PKI authentication option provides a high level of security and good
   scalability, however it requires the presence of credentials in the
   AUTH_SESSION policy element which impacts its size.
