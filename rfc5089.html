   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the

   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a
   Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and
   automatically discover a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs),
   along with information that can be used by the PCC for PCE selection.
   When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the
   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating
   passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs
   consists of using IGP flooding.  For that purpose, this document
   defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System
   (IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE Discovery
   information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing
   domain.

   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a Path
   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  The model allows
   for the separation of the PCE from a Path Computation Client (PCC)
   (also referred to as a non co-located PCE) and allows for cooperation
   between PCEs (where one PCE acts as a PCC to make requests of the
   other PCE).  This relies on a communication protocol between a PCC
   and PCE, and also between PCEs.  The requirements for such a
   communication protocol can be found in [RFC4657], and the
   communication protocol is defined in [PCEP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE architecture requires that a PCC be aware of the location of
   one or more PCEs in its domain, and, potentially, of PCEs in other
   domains, e.g., in the case of inter-domain TE LSP computation.
   A network may contain a large number of PCEs, each with potentially
   distinct capabilities.  In such a context, it is highly desirable to
   have a mechanism for automatic and dynamic PCE discovery that allows
   PCCs to automatically discover a set of PCEs, along with additional
   information about each PCE that may be used by a PCC to perform PCE
   selection.  Additionally, it is valuable for a PCC to dynamically
   detect new PCEs, failed PCEs, or any modification to the PCE
   information.  Detailed requirements for such a PCE discovery
   mechanism are provided in [RFC4674].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the PCE selection algorithm applied by a PCC is out of the
   scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When PCCs are LSRs participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS-IS), and PCEs
   are either LSRs or servers also participating in the IGP, an
   effective mechanism for PCE discovery within an IGP routing domain
   consists of utilizing IGP advertisements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines extensions to IS-IS [ISO] to allow a PCE in an
   IS-IS routing domain to advertise its location, along with some
   information useful to a PCC for PCE selection, so as to satisfy
   dynamic PCE discovery requirements set forth in [RFC4674].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Generic capability advertisement mechanisms for IS-IS are defined in
   [RFC4971].  These allow a router to advertise its capabilities within
   an IS-IS area or an entire IS-IS routing domain.  This document
   leverages this generic capability advertisement mechanism to fully
   satisfy the dynamic PCE discovery requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a new sub-TLV (named the PCE Discovery (PCED))
   to be carried within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV ([RFC4971]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE information advertised is detailed in Section 3.  Protocol
   extensions and procedures are defined in Sections 4 and 5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IS-IS extensions defined in this document allow for PCE discovery
   within an IS-IS routing domain.  Solutions for PCE discovery across
   AS boundaries are beyond the scope of this document, and are for
   further study.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a set of sub-TLVs that are nested within each
   other.  When the degree of nesting TLVs is 2 (a TLV is carried within
   another TLV) the TLV carried within a TLV is called a sub-TLV.
   Strictly speaking, when the degree of nesting is 3, a sub-sub-TLV is
   carried within a sub-TLV that is itself carried within a TLV.  For
   the sake of terminology simplicity, a TLV carried within another TLV
   is called a sub-TLV regardless of the degree of nesting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   PCE Discovery Information</h3></a>

   The PCE discovery information is composed of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The PCE location: an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is used to
      reach the PCE.  It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always
      reachable if there is any connectivity to the PCE;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The PCE path computation scope (i.e., intra-layer, inter-area,
      inter-AS, or inter-layer);

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The set of one or more PCE-Domain(s) into which the PCE has
      visibility and for which the PCE can compute paths;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The set of zero, one, or more neighbor PCE-Domain(s) toward which
      the PCE can compute paths;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  A set of communication capabilities (e.g., support for request
      prioritization) and path computation-specific capabilities (e.g.,
      supported constraints).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PCE discovery information is, by nature, fairly static and does not
   change with PCE activity.  Changes in PCE discovery information may
   occur as a result of PCE configuration updates, PCE
   deployment/activation, PCE deactivation/suppression, or PCE failure.
   Hence, this information is not expected to change frequently.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Flooding Scope</h3></a>

   The flooding scope for PCE information advertised through IS-IS can
   be a single L1 area, an L1 area and the L2 sub-domain, or the entire
   IS-IS routing domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   The IS-IS PCED Sub-TLV</h2></a>

   The IS-IS PCED sub-TLV contains a non-ordered set of sub-TLVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The format of the IS-IS PCED sub-TLV and its sub-TLVs is identical to
   the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS
   [RFC3784].  That is, the TLV is comprised of 1 octet for the type, 1
   octet specifying the TLV length, and a value field.  The Length field
   defines the length of the value portion in octets.
   The IS-IS PCED sub-TLV has the following format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TYPE:   5
      LENGTH: Variable
      VALUE:  Set of sub-TLVs

   Five sub-TLVs are defined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Sub-TLV type  Length               Name
             1      variable     PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV
             2         3         PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV
             3      variable     PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
             4      variable     NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
             5      variable     PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV

   The PCE-ADDRESS and PATH-SCOPE sub-TLVs MUST always be present within
   the PCED sub-TLV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE-DOMAIN and NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLVs are optional.  They MAY
   be present in the PCED sub-TLV to facilitate selection of
   inter-domain PCEs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is optional and MAY be present in the PCED
   sub-TLV to facilitate the PCE selection process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any unrecognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCED sub-TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV defined in
   [RFC4971].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   No additional sub-TLVs will be added to the PCED TLV in the future.
   If a future application requires the advertisement of additional PCE
   information in IS-IS, this will not be carried in the CAPABILITY TLV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following sub-sections describe the sub-TLVs that may be carried
   within the PCED sub-TLV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   PCE-ADDRESS Sub-TLV</h3></a>

   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV specifies an IP address that can be used to
   reach the PCE.  It is RECOMMENDED to make use of an address that is
   always reachable, provided the PCE is alive and reachable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the
   PCED sub-TLV.  It MAY appear twice, when the PCE has both an IPv4 and
   IPv6 address.  It MUST NOT appear more than once for the same address
   type.  If it appears more than once for the same address type, only
   the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.
   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV has the following format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TYPE:   1
      LENGTH: 5 for an IPv4 address or 17 for an IPv6 address.
      VALUE:  This comprises one octet indicating the address-type and 4
              or 16 octets encoding the IPv4 or IPv6 address to be used
              to reach the PCE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Address-type:
                  1   IPv4
                  2   IPv6

	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   The PATH-SCOPE Sub-TLV</h3></a>

   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV indicates the PCE path computation scope,
   which refers to the PCE's ability to compute or take part in the
   computation of paths for intra-area, inter-area, inter-AS, or
   inter-layer TE LSPs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the
   PCED sub-TLV.  There MUST be exactly one instance of the PATH-SCOPE
   sub-TLV within each PCED sub-TLV.  If it appears more than once only
   the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV contains a set of bit flags indicating the
   supported path scopes, and four fields indicating PCE preferences.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV has the following format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TYPE:   2
      LENGTH: 3
      VALUE:  This comprises a 1-octet flags field where each flag
              represents a supported path scope, followed by a 2-octet
              preferences field indicating PCE preferences.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Here is the structure of the flags field:

   PrefL field: PCE's preference for intra-area TE LSP computation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PrefR field: PCE's preference for inter-area TE LSP computation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PrefS field: PCE's preference for inter-AS TE LSP computation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Pref-Y field: PCE's preference for inter-layer TE LSP computation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Res: Reserved for future use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The L, R, S, and Y bits are set when the PCE can act as a PCE for
   intra-area, inter-area, inter-AS, or inter-layer TE LSP computation,
   respectively.  These bits are non-exclusive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When set, the Rd bit indicates that the PCE can act as a default PCE
   for inter-area TE LSP computation (that is, the PCE can compute a
   path toward any neighbor area).  Similarly, when set, the Sd bit
   indicates that the PCE can act as a default PCE for inter-AS TE LSP
   computation (the PCE can compute a path toward any neighbor AS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the Rd and Sd bit are set, the PCED sub-TLV MUST NOT contain a
   NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV (see Section 4.4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the R bit is clear, the Rd bit SHOULD be clear on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.  When the S bit is clear, the Sd bit
   SHOULD be clear on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PrefL, PrefR, PrefS and PrefY fields are each three bits long and
   allow the PCE to specify a preference for each computation scope,
   where 7 reflects the highest preference.  Such preferences can be
   used for weighted load balancing of path computation requests.  An
   operator may decide to configure a preference for each computation
   scope at each PCE so as to balance the path computation load among
   them.  The algorithms used by a PCC to balance its path computation
   requests according to such PCE preferences are out of the scope of
   this document and are a matter for local or network-wide policy.  The
   same or different preferences may be used for each scope.  For
   instance, an operator that wants a PCE capable of both inter-area and
   inter-AS computation to be preferred for use for inter-AS
   computations may configure PrefS higher than PrefR.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the L, R, S, or Y bits are cleared, the PrefL, PrefR, PrefS, and
   PrefY fields SHOULD respectively be set to 0 on transmission and MUST
   be ignored on receipt.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both reserved fields SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST
   be ignored on receipt.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   PCE-DOMAIN Sub-TLV</h3></a>

   The PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV specifies a PCE-Domain (area and/or AS) where
   the PCE has topology visibility and through which the PCE can compute
   paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV SHOULD be present when PCE-Domains for which
   the PCE can operate cannot be inferred by other IGP information: for
   instance, when the PCE is inter-domain capable (i.e., when the R bit
   or S bit is set) and the flooding scope is the entire routing domain
   (see Section 5 for a discussion of how the flooding scope is set and
   interpreted).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PCED sub-TLV may include multiple PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLVs when the PCE
   has visibility into multiple PCE-Domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV has the following format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TYPE:   3
      LENGTH: Variable
      VALUE:  This is composed of one octet indicating the domain-type
              (area ID or AS Number) and a variable length IS-IS area ID
              or a 32-bit AS number, identifying a PCE-Domain where the
              PCE has visibility and can compute paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two domain types are defined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                  1   Area ID

   have its first two octets set to 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN Sub-TLV</h3></a>

   The NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV specifies a neighbor PCE-Domain (area or
   AS) toward which a PCE can compute paths.  It means that the PCE can
   take part in the computation of inter-domain TE LSPs with paths that
   transit this neighbor PCE-Domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PCED sub-TLV may include several NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLVs when the
   PCE can compute paths towards several neighbor PCE-Domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV has the same format as the PCE-DOMAIN
   sub-TLV:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV MUST be present at least once with
   domain-type set to 1 if the R bit is set and the Rd bit is cleared,
   and MUST be present at least once with domain-type set to 2 if the S
   bit is set and the Sd bit is cleared.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   PCE-CAP-FLAGS Sub-TLV</h3></a>

   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to indicate PCE
   capabilities.  It MAY be present within the PCED sub-TLV.  It MUST
   NOT be present more than once.  If it appears more than once, only
   the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.
   The value field of the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is made up of an array
   of units of 32-bit flags numbered from the most significant bit as
   bit zero, where each bit represents one PCE capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV has the following format:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TYPE:   5
      LENGTH: Multiple of 4
      VALUE:  This contains an array of units of 32-bit flags numbered
              from the most significant as bit zero, where each bit
              represents one PCE capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE capability registry is managed by IANA; it is common with
   OSPF and defined in [RFC5088].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reserved bits SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Elements of Procedure</h2></a>

   The PCED sub-TLV is advertised within an IS-IS Router Capability TLV
   defined in [RFC4971].  As such, elements of procedures are inherited
   from those defined in [RFC4971].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The flooding scope is controlled by the S flag in the IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV (see [RFC4971]).  When the scope of the PCED sub-TLV
   is area local, it MUST be carried within an IS-IS Router Capability
   TLV having the S bit cleared.  When the scope of the PCED sub-TLV is
   the entire IS-IS routing domain, it MUST be carried within an IS-IS
   Router Capability TLV having the S bit set.  Note that when only the
   L bit of the PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV is set, the flooding scope MUST be
   area local.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that an L1L2 node may include a PCED TLV in a Router Capability
   TLV with the S bit cleared in both in its L1 and L2 LSPs.  This
   allows the flooding scope to be restricted to the L1 area and the L2
   sub-domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the PCE function is deactivated, the IS-IS speaker advertising
   this PCE MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP that no longer includes the
   corresponding PCED TLV.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE address (i.e., the address indicated within the PCE-ADDRESS
   sub-TLV) SHOULD be reachable via some prefixes advertised by IS-IS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCED sub-TLV information regarding a specific PCE is only
   considered current and useable when the router advertising this
   information is itself reachable via IS-IS calculated paths at the
   level of the LSP in which the PCED sub-TLV appears.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A change in the state of a PCE (activate, deactivate, parameter
   change) MUST result in a corresponding change in the PCED sub-TLV
   information advertised by an IS-IS router (inserted, removed,
   updated) in its LSP.  The way PCEs determine the information they
   advertise, and how that information is made available to IS-IS, is
   out of the scope of this document.  Some information may be
   configured (e.g., address, preferences, scope) and other information
   may be automatically determined by the PCE (e.g., areas of
   visibility).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A change in information in the PCED sub-TLV MUST NOT trigger any SPF
   computation at a receiving router.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Backward Compatibility</h2></a>

   The PCED sub-TLV defined in this document does not introduce any
   interoperability issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An IS-IS router not supporting the PCED sub-TLV will just silently
   ignore the sub-TLV as specified in [RFC4971].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has defined a registry for the sub-TLVs carried in the IS-IS
   Router Capability TLV defined in [RFC4971].  IANA has assigned a new
   sub-TLV codepoint for the PCED sub-TLV carried within the Router
   Capability TLV.

     5       PCED sub-TLV              (this document)

	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document defines IS-IS extensions for PCE discovery within an
   administrative domain.  Hence the security of the PCE discovery
   relies on the security of IS-IS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Mechanisms defined to ensure authenticity and integrity of IS-IS LSPs
   [RFC3567] and their TLVs, can be used to secure the PCED sub-TLV as
   well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IS-IS provides no encryption mechanism for protecting the privacy of
   LSPs and, in particular, the privacy of the PCE discovery
   information.
	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Manageability Considerations</h2></a>

   Manageability considerations for PCE Discovery are addressed in
   Section 4.10 of [RFC4674].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.1"><h3>9.1   Control of Policy and Functions</h3></a>

   Requirements for the configuration of PCE discovery parameters on
   PCCs and PCEs are discussed in Section 4.10.1 of [RFC4674].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In particular, a PCE implementation SHOULD allow the following
   parameters to be configured on the PCE:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -The PCE IPv4/IPv6 address(es) (see Section 4.1).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -The PCE Scope, including the inter-domain functions (inter-area,
       inter-AS, inter-layer), the preferences, and whether the PCE can
       act as default PCE (see Section 4.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -The PCE-Domains (see Section 4.3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -The neighbor PCE-Domains (see Section 4.4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -The PCE capabilities (see Section 4.5).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.2"><h3>9.2   Information and Data Model</h3></a>

   A MIB module for PCE Discovery is defined in [PCED-MIB].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.3"><h3>9.3   Liveness Detection and Monitoring</h3></a>

   This document specifies the use of IS-IS as a PCE Discovery Protocol.
   The requirements specified in [RFC4674] include the ability to
   determine liveness of the PCE Discovery protocol.  Normal operation
   of the IS-IS protocol meets these requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.4"><h3>9.4   Verify Correct Operations</h3></a>

   The correlation of information advertised against information
   received can be achieved by comparing the information in the PCED
   sub-TLV received by the PCC with that stored at the PCE using the
   PCED MIB [PCED-MIB].  The number of dropped, corrupt, and rejected
   information elements are available through the PCED MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.5"><h3>9.5   Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components</h3></a>

   The IS-IS extensions defined in this document do not imply any
   requirements on other protocols.
	<a name="section-9.6"><h3>9.6   Impact on Network Operations</h3></a>

   Frequent changes in PCE information advertised in the PCED sub-TLV
   may have a significant impact on IS-IS and might destabilize the
   operation of the network by causing the PCCs to swap between PCEs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As discussed in Section 4.10.4 of [RFC4674], it MUST be possible to
   apply at least the following controls:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  Configurable limit on the rate of announcement of changed
         parameters at a PCE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  Control of the impact on PCCs, such as through rate-limiting
         the processing of PCED sub-TLVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  Configurable control of triggers that cause a PCC to swap to
         another PCE.
