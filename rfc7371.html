   This document updates the IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291] by
   redefining reserved bits as generic flag bits (Section 2).  The
   document also provides some clarifications related to the use of
   these flag bits (Section 3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document updates [RFC3956], [RFC3306], and [RFC4291].  These
   updates are logical consequences of the new processing rules in
   Section 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Textual representation of IPv6 addresses included in the RFC updates
   follows the recommendation in [RFC5952].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Language</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Addressing Architecture Update</h2></a>

   Bits 17-20 of a multicast address, where bit 1 is the most
   significant bit, are defined in [RFC3956] and [RFC3306] as reserved
   bits.  This document defines these bits as generic flag bits so that
   they apply to any multicast address.  These bits are referred to as
   "ff2" (flag field 2), while the "flgs" bits in [RFC4291] [RFC3956]
   are renamed to "ff1" (flag field 1).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Within this document, flag bits denote both ff1 and ff2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Defining the bits 17-20 as flags for all IPv6 multicast addresses
   allows addresses to be treated in a more uniform and generic way, and
   allows for these bits to be defined in the future for different
   purposes, irrespective of the specific type of multicast address.
   For the record, this design choice was initially triggered by the
   specification in [ADDR-FORMAT], which proposed associating a meaning
   with one of the reserved bits.  Moreover, [ADDR-FORMAT] also
   considered the use of the last remaining flag in ff1, but that
   approach was abandoned because it is not clear at this stage whether
   there are other usage scenarios of the flag.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 4 specifies the updated structure of the addressing
   architecture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further specification documents may define a meaning for these
   flag bits.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Flag Bits: New Processing Rules</h2></a>

   Some implementations and specification documents do not treat the
   flag bits as separate bits but tend to use their combined value as a
   4-bit integer.  This practice is a hurdle for assigning a meaning to
   the remaining flag bits.  Below are listed some examples for
   illustration purposes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The reading of [RFC3306] may lead one to conclude that ff3x::/32
      is the only allowed Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) IPv6 prefix
      block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  [RFC3956] states that only ff70::/12 applies to Embedded-RP.
      Particularly, implementations should not treat the fff0::/12 range
      as Embedded-RP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To avoid such confusion and to unambiguously associate a meaning with
   the remaining flags, the following requirement is made:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Implementations MUST treat flag bits as separate bits.

    effect, this implies the prefix FF70::/12.  In this case, the last 4
    bits of the previously reserved field are interpreted as embedding
    the RP interface ID, as specified in this memo.
    The behavior is unspecified if P or T is not set to 1, as then the
    prefix would not be FF70::/12.  Likewise, the encoding and the
    protocol mode used when the two high-order bits in "flgs" are set to
    11 ("FFF0::/12") is intentionally unspecified until such time that
    the highest-order bit is defined.  Without further IETF
