  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Requirements
  and Protocol Extensions in Support of Global Concurrent Optimization

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) allows
   Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to request path computations from
   Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and lets the PCEs return responses.
   When computing or reoptimizing the routes of a set of Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) through a network, it may
   be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to avoid
   blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions.
   Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization
   (GCO).  A GCO is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology
   of the network and the complete set of existing TE LSPs, and their
   respective constraints, and look to optimize or reoptimize the entire
   network to satisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs.  A GCO may also
   be applied to some subset of the TE LSPs in a network.  The GCO
   application is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.

   [RFC4655] defines the Path Computation Element (PCE)-based
   architecture and explains how a PCE may compute Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
   and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the request of Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is shown to be any network
   component that makes such a request and may be, for instance, a Label
   Switching Router (LSR) or a Network Management System (NMS).  The
   PCE, itself, is shown to be located anywhere within the network, and
   it may be within an LSR, an NMS or Operational Support System (OSS),
   or may be an independent network server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol
   used between PCC and PCE, and it may also be used between cooperating
   PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out generic protocol requirements for PCEP.
   Additional application-specific requirements for PCEP are defined in
   separate documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document provides a set of requirements and PCEP extensions in
   support of concurrent path computation applications.  A concurrent
   path computation is a path computation application where a set of TE
   paths are computed concurrently in order to efficiently utilize
   network resources.  The computation method involved with a concurrent
   path computation is referred to as "global concurrent optimization"
   in this document.  Appropriate computation algorithms to perform this
   type of optimization are out of the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO) application is primarily an
   NMS or a PCE-Server-based solution.  Owing to complex synchronization
   issues associated with GCO applications, the management-based PCE
   architecture defined in Section 5.5 of [RFC4655] is considered as the
   most suitable usage to support GCO application.  This does not
   preclude other architectural alternatives to support GCO application,
   but they are NOT RECOMMENDED.  For instance, GCO might be enabled by
   distributed LSRs through complex synchronization mechanisms.
   However, this approach might suffer from significant synchronization
   overhead between the PCE and each of the PCCs.  It would likely
   affect the network stability and hence significantly diminish the
   benefits of deploying PCEs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The need for global concurrent path computation may also arise when
   network operators need to establish a set of TE LSPs in their network
   planning process.  It is also envisioned that network operators might
   require global concurrent path computation in the event of
   catastrophic network failures, where a set of TE LSPs need to be
   optimally rerouted.  The nature of this work promotes the use of such
   systems for off-line processing.  Online application of this work
   should only be considered with proven empirical validation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As new TE LSPs are added or removed from the network over time, the
   global network resources become fragmented and the existing placement
   of TE LSPs within the network no longer provides optimal use of the
   available capacity.  A global concurrent path computation is able to
   simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the
   complete set of existing TE LSPs and their respective constraints,
   and is able to look to reoptimize the entire network to satisfy all
   constraints for all TE LSPs.  Alternatively, the application may
   consider a subset of the TE LSPs and/or a subset of the network
   topology.  Note that other preemption can also help reduce the
   fragmentation issues.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While GCO is applicable to any simultaneous request for multiple TE
   LSPs (for example, a request for end-to-end protection), it is NOT
   RECOMMENDED that global concurrent reoptimization would be applied in
   a network (such as an MPLS-TE network) that contains a very large
   number of very low bandwidth or zero bandwidth TE LSPs since the
   large scope of the problem and the small benefit of concurrent
   reoptimization relative to single TE LSP reoptimization is unlikely
   to make the process worthwhile.  Further, applying global concurrent
   reoptimization in a network with a high rate of change of TE LSPs
   (churn) is NOT RECOMMENDED because of the likelihood that TE LSPs
   would change before they could be globally reoptimized.  Global
   reoptimization is more applicable to stable networks such as
   transport networks or those with long-term TE LSP tunnels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The main focus of this document is to highlight the PCC-PCE
   communication needs in support of a concurrent path computation
   application and to define protocol extensions to meet those needs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCC-PCE requirements addressed herein are specific to the context
   where the PCE is a specialized PCE that is capable of performing
   computations in support of GCO.  Discovery of such capabilities might
   be desirable and could be achieved through extensions to the PCE
   discovery mechanisms [RFC4674], [RFC5088], [RFC5089]; but, that is
   out of the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is to be noted that Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC)
   [RFC5441] is a multi-PCE path computation technique used to compute a
   shortest constrained inter-domain path, whereas this ID specifies a

   sent to a PCE with the objective of "optimizing" the set of computed
   paths.

   This section discusses the PCE architecture to which GCO is applied.
   It also discusses various application scenarios for which global
   concurrent path computation may be applied.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Application of the PCE Architecture</h3></a>

   Figure 1 shows the PCE-based network architecture as defined in
   [RFC4655] to which GCO application is applied.  It must be observed
   that the PCC is not necessarily an LSR [RFC4655].  The GCO
   application is primarily an NMS-based solution in which an NMS plays
   the function of the PCC.  Although Figure 1 shows the PCE as remote
   from the NMS, it might be collocated with the NMS.  Note that in the
   collocated case, there is no need for a standard communication
   protocol; this can rely on internal APIs.

                            Global Concurrent Optimization

   Upon receipt of an application request (e.g., a traffic demand matrix
   is provided to the NMS by the operator's network planning procedure),
   the NMS requests a global concurrent path computation from the PCE.
   The PCE then computes the requested paths concurrently applying some
   algorithms.  Various algorithms and computation techniques have been
   proposed to perform this function.  Specification of such algorithms
   or techniques is outside the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the requested path computation completes, the PCE sends the
   resulting paths back to the NMS.  The NMS then supplies the head-end
   LSRs with a fully computed explicit path for each TE LSP that needs
   to be established.
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Greenfield Optimization</h3></a>

   Greenfield optimization is a special case of GCO application when
   there are no TE LSPs already set up in the network.  The need for
   greenfield optimization arises when the network planner wants to make
   use of a computation server to plan the TE LSPs that will be
   provisioned in the network.  Note that greenfield operation is a
   one-time optimization.  When network conditions change due to failure
   or other changes, then the reoptimization mode of operation will kick
   in.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a new TE network needs to be provisioned from a greenfield
   perspective, a set of TE LSPs needs to be created based on traffic
   demand, network topology, service constraints, and network resources.
   In this scenario, the ability to perform concurrent computation is
   desirable, or required, to utilize network resources in an optimal
   manner and avoid blocking.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   Single-Layer Traffic Engineering</h4></a>

   Greenfield optimization can be applied when layer-specific TE LSPs
   need to be created from a greenfield perspective.  For example, an
   MPLS-TE network can be planned based on Layer 3 specific traffic
   demands, the network topology, and available network resources.
   Greenfield optimization for single-layer traffic engineering can be
   applied to optical transport networks such as Synchronous Digital
   Hierarchy/Synchronous Optical Network (SDH/SONET), Ethernet
   Transport, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2   Multi-Layer Traffic Engineering</h4></a>

   Greenfield optimization is not limited to single-layer traffic
   engineering.  It can also be applied to multi-layer traffic
   engineering [PCE-MLN].  The network resources and topology (of both
   the client and server layers) can be considered simultaneously in
   setting up a set of TE LSPs that traverse the layer boundary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Reoptimization of Existing Networks</h3></a>

   The need for global concurrent path computation may arise in existing
   networks.  When an existing TE LSP network experiences sub-optimal
   use of its resources, the need for reoptimization or reconfiguration
   may arise.  The scope of reoptimization and reconfiguration may vary
   depending on particular situations.  The scope of reoptimization may
   be limited to bandwidth modification to an existing TE LSP.  However,
   it could well be that a set of TE LSPs may need to be reoptimized
   concurrently.  In an extreme case, the TE LSPs may need to be
   globally reoptimized.
   In loaded networks, with large size TE LSPs, a sequential
   reoptimization may not produce substantial improvements in terms of
   overall network optimization.  Sequential reoptimization refers to a
   path computation method that computes the reoptimized path of one TE
   LSP at a time without giving any consideration to the other TE LSPs
   that need to be reoptimized in the network.  The potential for
   network-wide gains from reoptimization of TE LSPs sequentially is
   dependent upon the network usage and size of the TE LSPs being
   optimized.  However, the key point remains: computing the reoptimized
   path of one TE LSP at a time without giving any consideration to the
   other TE LSPs in the network could result in sub-optimal use of
   network resources.  This may be far more visible in an optical
   network with a low ratio of potential TE LSPs per link, and far less
   visible in packet networks with micro-flow TE LSPs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With regards to applicability of GCO in the event of catastrophic
   failures, there may be a real benefit in computing the paths of the
   TE LSPs as a set rather than computing new paths from the head-end
   LSRs in a distributed manner.  Distributed jittering is a technique
   that could prevent race condition (i.e., competing for the same
   resource from different head-end LSRs) with a distributed
   computation.  GCO provides an alternative way that could also prevent
   race condition in a centralized manner.  However, a centralized
   system will typically suffer from a slower response time than a
   distributed system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1   Reconfiguration of the Virtual Network Topology (VNT)</h4></a>

   Reconfiguration of the VNT [RFC5212] [PCE-MLN] is a typical
   application scenario where global concurrent path computation may be
   applicable.  Triggers for VNT reconfiguration, such as traffic demand
   changes, network failures, and topological configuration changes may
   require a set of existing TE LSPs to be re-computed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2   Traffic Migration</h4></a>

   When migrating from one set of TE LSPs to a reoptimized set of TE
   LSPs, it is important that the traffic be moved without causing
   disruption.  Various techniques exist in MPLS and GMPLS, such as
   make-before-break [RFC3209], to establish the new TE LSPs before
   tearing down the old TE LSPs.  When multiple TE LSP routes are
   changed according to the computed results, some of the TE LSPs may be
   disrupted due to the resource constraints.  In other words, it may
   prove to be impossible to perform a direct migration from the old TE
   LSPs to the new optimal TE LSPs without disrupting traffic because
   there are insufficient network resources to support both sets of TE
   LSPs when make-before-break is used.  However, a PCE may be able to
   determine a sequence of make-before-break replacement of individual
   TE LSPs or small sets of TE LSPs so that the full set of TE LSPs can
   be migrated without any disruption.  This scenario assumes that the
   bandwidth of existing TE LSP is kept during the migration, which is
   required in optical networks.  In packet networks, this assumption
   can be relaxed as the bandwidth of temporary TE LSPs during migration
   can be zeroed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It may be the case that the reoptimization is radical.  This could
   mean that it is not possible to apply make-before-break in any order
   to migrate from the old TE LSPs to the new TE LSPs.  In this case, a
   migration strategy is required that may necessitate TE LSPs being
   rerouted using make-before-break onto temporary paths in order to
   make space for the full reoptimization.  A PCE might indicate the
   order in which reoptimized TE LSPs must be established and take over
   from the old TE LSPs, and it may indicate a series of different
   temporary paths that must be used.  Alternatively, the PCE might
   perform the global reoptimization as a series of sub-reoptimizations
   by reoptimizing subsets of the total set of TE LSPs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The benefit of this multi-step rerouting includes minimization of
   traffic disruption and optimization gain.  However, this approach may
   imply some transient packets desequencing, jitter, as well as control
   plane stress.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note also that during reoptimization, traffic disruption may be
   allowed for some TE LSPs carrying low priority services (e.g.,

   This section provides the PCECP requirements to support global
   concurrent path computation applications.  The requirements specified
   here should be regarded as application-specific requirements and are
   justifiable based on the extensibility clause found in Section 6.1.14
   of [RFC4657]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The PCECP MUST support the requirements specified in the
      application-specific requirements documents.  The PCECP MUST also
      allow extensions as more PCE applications will be introduced in
      the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is also to be noted that some of the requirements discussed in
   this section have already been discussed in the PCECP requirement
   document [RFC4657].  For example, Section 5.1.16 in [RFC4657]
   provides a list of generic constraints while Section 5.1.17 in
   [RFC4657] provides a list of generic objective functions that MUST be
   supported by the PCECP.  While using such generic requirements as the
   baseline, this section provides application-specific requirements in
   the context of global concurrent path computation and in a more
   detailed level than the generic requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PCEP SHOULD support the following capabilities either via
   creation of new objects and/or modification of existing objects where
   applicable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An indicator to convey that the request is for a global concurrent
      path computation.  This indicator is necessary to ensure
      consistency in applying global objectives and global constraints
      in all path computations.  Note: This requirement is covered by
      "synchronized path computation" in [RFC4655] and [RFC4657].
      However, an explicit indicator to request a global concurrent
      optimization is a new requirement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   o  A Global Objective Function (GOF) field in which to specify the
      global objective function.  The global objective function is the
      overarching objective function to which all individual path

      optimal solution.  Note that this requirement is covered by
      "synchronized objective functions" in Section 5.1.7 [RFC4657] and
      that [RFC5541] defined three global objective functions as
      follows.  A list of available global objective functions SHOULD

         requested in [RFC4657] and defined in [RFC5440]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Exclusion of links/nodes in all TE LSP path computation (i.e.,

      requirement is entirely fulfilled by the SVEC object in the PCEP
      specification [RFC5440].  Since the SVEC object as defined in
      [RFC5440] allows identifying a set of concurrent path requests,
      the SVEC can be reused to specify all the individual concurrent

         the migration.  That is, the request message MUST allow

         traffic disruption.  It should indicate for each request the
         order in which the old TE LSP should be removed and the order
         in which the new TE LSP should be setup.  If the removal order
         is lower than the setup order, this means that make-before-
         break cannot be done for this request.  It MAY also be
         desirable to have the PCE indicate whether ordering is in fact
         required or not.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  During a migration, it may not be possible to do a make-before-

   All the path requests in this application should be indicated so that

   The PCE MUST specify the order number in response to the Order
   Request made by the PCC in the PCReq message if so requested by the

   support such an ordering indication, a new optional TLV, the Order

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The delete order SHOULD NOT be equal to the setup order.  If the

   To illustrate this, consider a network with two established TE LSPs:
   R1 with path P1, and R2 with path P2.  During a reoptimization, the
   PCE may provide the following ordered reply:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R1, path P1', remove order 1, setup order 4
   R2, path P2', remove order 3, setup order 2

	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   When global reoptimization is applied to an active network, it could
   be extremely disruptive.  Although the real security and policy
   issues apply at the NMS, if the wrong results are returned to the
   NMS, the wrong actions may be taken in the network.  Therefore, it is
   very important that the operator issuing the commands has sufficient
   authority and is authenticated, and that the computation request is
   subject to appropriate policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mechanism defined in [RFC5440] to secure a PCEP session can be
   used to secure global concurrent path computation requests/responses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA maintains a registry of PCEP parameters.  IANA has made
   allocations from the sub-registries as described in the following
   sections.
