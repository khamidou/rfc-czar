             The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Framework

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient,
   flexible, and future-proof header compression concept.  It is
   designed to operate efficiently and robustly over various link
   technologies with different characteristics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ROHC framework, along with a set of compression profiles, was
   initially defined in RFC 3095.  To improve and simplify the ROHC
   specifications, this document explicitly defines the ROHC framework
   and the profile for uncompressed separately.  More specifically, the
   definition of the framework does not modify or update the definition
   of the framework specified by RFC 3095.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification obsoletes RFC 4995.  It fixes one interoperability
   issue that was erroneously introduced in RFC 4995, and adds some
   minor clarifications.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   For many types of networks, reducing the deployment and operational
   costs by improving the usage of the bandwidth resources is of vital
   importance.  Header compression over a link is possible because some
   of the information carried within the header of a packet becomes
   compressible between packets belonging to the same flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For links where the overhead of the IP header(s) is problematic, the
   total size of the header may be significant.  Applications
   transferring data carried within RTP [RFC3550] will then, in addition
   to link-layer framing, have an IPv4 [RFC0791] header (20 octets), a
   UDP [RFC0768] header (8 octets), and an RTP header (12 octets), for a
   total of 40 octets.  With IPv6 [RFC2460], the IPv6 header is 40
   octets for a total of 60 octets.  Applications transferring data
   using TCP [RFC0793] will have 20 octets for the transport header, for
   a total size of 40 octets for IPv4 and 60 octets for IPv6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The relative gain for specific flows (or applications) depends on the
   size of the payload used in each packet.  For applications such as
   Voice over IP, where the size of the payload containing coded speech
   can be as small as 15-20 octets, this gain will be quite significant.
   Similarly, relative gains for TCP flows carrying large payloads (such
   as file transfers) will be less than for flows carrying smaller
   payloads (such as application signaling, e.g., session initiation).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As more and more wireless link technologies are being deployed to
   carry IP traffic, care must be taken to address the specific
   characteristics of these technologies within the header compression
   algorithms.  Legacy header compression schemes, such as those defined
   in [RFC2507] and [RFC2508], have been shown to perform inadequately
   over links where both the lossy behavior and the round-trip times are
   non-negligible, such as those observed, for example, in wireless
   links and IP tunnels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, a header compression scheme should handle the often non-
   trivial residual errors, i.e., where the lower layer may pass a
   packet that contains undetected bit errors to the decompressor.  It
   should also handle loss and reordering before the compression point,
   as well as on the link between the compression and decompression
   points [RFC4224].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient,
   flexible, and future-proof header compression concept.  It is
   designed to operate efficiently and robustly over various link
   technologies with different characteristics.
   RFC 3095 [RFC3095] defines the ROHC framework along with an initial
   set of compression profiles.  To improve and simplify the
   specification, the framework and the profiles' parts have been split
   into separate documents.  This document explicitly defines the ROHC
   framework, but it does not modify or update the definition of the
   framework specified by RFC 3095; both documents can be used
   independently of each other.  This also implies that implementations
   based on either definition will be compatible and interoperable with
   each other.  However, it is the intent to let this specification
   replace RFC 3095 as the base specification for all profiles defined
   in the future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document fixes one interoperability issue that was erroneously
   introduced in RFC 4995.  The fix for this issue is located in
   Section 5.2.4.1 and clarifies the interpretation of the Size field in
   ROHC feedback.

   Context

      The context of the compressor is the state it uses to compress a
      header.  The context of the decompressor is the state it uses to
      decompress a header.  Either of these or the two in combination
      are usually referred to as "context", when it is clear which is
      intended.  The context contains relevant information from previous
      headers in the packet flow, such as static fields and possible
      reference values for compression and decompression.  Moreover,
      additional information describing the packet flow is also part of
      the context, for example, information about the change behavior of
      fields (e.g., the IP Identifier behavior, or the typical inter-
      packet increase in sequence numbers and timestamps).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Context damage

      When the context of the decompressor is not consistent with the
      context of the compressor, decompression may fail to reproduce the
      original header.  This situation can occur when the context of the
      decompressor has not been initialized properly or when packets
      have been lost or damaged between the compressor and decompressor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Packets that cannot be decompressed due to inconsistent contexts
      are said to be lost due to context damage.  Packets that are
      decompressed but contain errors due to inconsistent contexts are
      said to be damaged due to context damage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Context repair mechanisms

      Mechanisms used to resynchronize the contexts -- an important task
      since context damage causes loss propagation.  Examples of such
      mechanisms are NACK-based mechanisms, and the periodic refreshes
      of important context information, usually done in unidirectional
      operation.  There are also mechanisms that can reduce the context
      inconsistency probability, for example, repetition of the same
      type of information in multiple packets and CRCs that protect
      context-updating information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CRC-8 validation

      The validation of the integrity against bit error(s) in a received
      IR and IR-DYN header using the 8-bit CRC included in the IR/IR-DYN
      header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CRC verification

      The verification of the result of a decompression attempt using
      the 3-bit CRC or 7-bit CRC included in the header of a compressed
      packet format.
   Damage propagation

      Delivery of incorrect decompressed headers due to context damage,
      such as errors in (i.e., loss of or damage to) previous header(s)
      or feedback.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Error detection

      Detection of errors by lower layers.  If error detection is not
      perfect, there will be residual errors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Error propagation

      Damage propagation or loss propagation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ROHC profile

      A compression protocol that specifies how to compress specific
      header combinations.  A ROHC profile may be tailored to handle a
      specific set of link characteristics, e.g., loss characteristics,
      reordering between compression points, etc.  ROHC profiles provide
      the details of the header compression framework defined in this
      document, and each compression profile is associated with a unique
      ROHC profile identifier [ROHC-ids].  When setting up a ROHC
      channel, the set of profiles supported by both endpoints of the
      channel is negotiated, and when initializing new contexts, a
      profile identifier from this negotiated set is used to associate
      each compression context with one specific profile.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Link

      A physical transmission path that constitutes a single IP hop.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Loss propagation

      Loss of headers, due to errors in (i.e., loss of or damage to)
      previous header(s) or feedback.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Packet flow

      A sequence of packets where the field values and change patterns
      of field values are such that the headers can be compressed using
      the same context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Residual error

      Error introduced during transmission and not detected by lower-
      layer error detection schemes.
   ROHC channel

      A logical unidirectional point-to-point channel carrying ROHC
      packets from one compressor to one decompressor, optionally
      carrying ROHC feedback information on the behalf of another
      compressor-decompressor pair operating on a separate ROHC channel
      in the opposite direction.  See also [RFC3759].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document also makes use of the conceptual terminology defined by

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Background (Informative)</h2></a>

   This section provides a background to the subject of header
   compression.  The fundamental ideas are described together with a
   discussion about the history of header compression schemes.  The
   motivations driving the development of the various schemes are
   discussed and their drawbacks identified, thereby providing the
   foundations for the design of the ROHC framework and profiles
   [RFC3095].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Header Compression Fundamentals</h3></a>

   Header compression is possible because there is significant
   redundancy between header field values within packets, but in
   particular between consecutive packets belonging to the same flow.
   On the path end-to-end, the entire header information is necessary
   for all packets in the flow, but over a single link, some of this
   information becomes redundant and can be reduced, as long as it is
   transparently recovered at the receiving end of the link.  The header
   size can be reduced by first sending field information that is
   expected to remain static for (at least most of) the lifetime of the
   packet flow.  Further compression is achieved for the fields carrying
   information that changes more dynamically by using compression
   methods tailored to their respective assumed change behavior.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To achieve compression and decompression, some necessary information
   from past packets is maintained in a context.  The compressor and the
   decompressor update their respective contexts upon certain, not
   necessarily synchronized, events.  Impairment events may lead to
   inconsistencies in the decompressor context (i.e., context damage),
   which in turn may cause incorrect decompression.  A Robust Header
   Compression scheme needs mechanisms to minimize the possibility of
   context damage, in combination with mechanisms for context repair.
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   A Short History of Header Compression</h3></a>

   The first header compression scheme, compressed TCP (CTCP) [RFC1144],
   was introduced by Van Jacobson.  CTCP, also often referred to as VJ
   compression, compresses the 40 octets of the TCP/IP header down to 4
   octets.  CTCP uses delta encoding for sequentially changing fields.
   The CTCP compressor detects transport-level retransmissions and sends
   a header that updates the entire context when they occur.  This
   repair mechanism does not require any explicit signaling between the
   compressor and decompressor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A general IP header compression scheme, IP header compression
   [RFC2507], improves somewhat on CTCP.  IP header compression (IPHC)
   can compress arbitrary IP, TCP, and UDP headers.  When compressing
   non-TCP headers, IPHC does not use delta encoding and is robust.  The
   repair mechanism of CTCP is augmented with negative acknowledgments,
   called CONTEXT_STATE messages, which speed up the repair.  This
   context repair mechanism is thus limited by the round-trip time of
   the link.  IPHC does not compress RTP headers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CRTP [RFC2508] is an RTP extension to IPHC.  CRTP compresses the 40
   octets of IPv4/UDP/RTP headers to a minimum of 2 octets when the UDP
   Checksum is not enabled.  If the UDP Checksum is enabled, the minimum
   CRTP header is 4 octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On lossy links with long round-trip times, CRTP does not perform well
   [CRTP-eval].  Each packet lost over the link causes decompression of
   several subsequent packets to fail, because the context becomes
   invalidated during at least one link round-trip time from the lost
   packet.  Unfortunately, the large headers that CRTP sends when
   updating the context waste additional bandwidth.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CRTP uses a local repair mechanism known as TWICE, which was
   introduced by IPHC.  TWICE derives its name from the observation that
   when the flow of compressed packets is regular, the correct guess
   when one packet is lost between the compression points is to apply
   the update in the current packet twice.  While TWICE improves CRTP
   performance significantly, [CRTP-eval] also found that even with
   TWICE, CRTP doubled the number of lost packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An enhanced variant of CRTP, called eCRTP [RFC3545], means to improve
   the robustness of CRTP in the presence of reordering and packet
   losses, while keeping the protocol almost unchanged from CRTP.  As a
   result, eCRTP does provide better means to implement some degree of
   robustness, albeit at the expense of additional overhead, leading to
   a reduction in compression efficiency in comparison to CRTP.

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   General Principles</h3></a>

   As mentioned earlier, header compression is possible per-link due to
   the fact that there is much redundancy between header field values
   within packets, and especially between consecutive packets belonging
   to the same flow.  To utilize these properties for header
   compression, there are a few essential steps to consider.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first step consists of identifying and grouping packets together
   into different "flows", so that packet-to-packet redundancy is
   maximized in order to improve the compression ratio.  Grouping
   packets into flows is usually based on source and destination host
   (IP) addresses, transport protocol type (e.g., UDP or TCP), process
   (port) numbers, and potentially additional unique application
   identifiers, such as the synchronization source (SSRC) in RTP
   [RFC3550].  The compressor and decompressor each establish a context
   for the packet flow and identify the context with a Context
   Identifier (CID) included in each compressed header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The second step is to understand the change patterns of the various
   header fields.  On a high level, header fields fall into one of the
   following classes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   INFERRED      These fields contain values that can be inferred from
                 other fields or external sources; for example, the size
                 of the frame carrying the packet can often be derived
                 from the link-layer protocol, and thus does not have to
                 be transmitted by the compression scheme.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   STATIC        Fields classified as STATIC are assumed to be constant
                 throughout the lifetime of the packet flow.  The value
                 of each field is thus only communicated initially.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   STATIC-DEF    Fields classified as STATIC-DEF are used to define a
                 packet flow as discussed above.  Packets for which
                 respective values of these fields differ are treated as
                 belonging to different flows.  These fields are in
                 general compressed as STATIC fields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   STATIC-KNOWN  Fields classified as STATIC-KNOWN are expected to have
                 well-known values, and therefore their values do not
                 need to be communicated.
   CHANGING      These fields are expected to vary randomly, either
                 within a limited value set or range, or in some other
                 manner.  CHANGING fields are usually handled in more
                 sophisticated ways based on a more detailed
                 classification of their expected change patterns.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, the last step is to choose the encoding method(s) that will
   be applied onto different fields based on classification.  The
   encoding methods, in combination with the identified field behavior,
   provide the input to the design of the compressed header formats.
   The analysis of the probability distribution of the identified change
   patterns then provides the means to optimize the packet formats,
   where the most frequently occurring change patterns for a field
   should be encoded within the most efficient format(s).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, compression efficiency has to be traded against two other
   properties: the robustness of the encoding to losses and errors
   between the compressor and the decompressor, and the ability to
   detect and cope with errors in the decompression process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Compression Efficiency, Robustness, and Transparency</h3></a>

   The performance of a header compression protocol can be described
   with three parameters: its compression efficiency, its robustness,
   and its compression transparency.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Compression efficiency

      The compression efficiency is determined by how much the average
      header size is reduced by applying the compression protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Robustness

      A robust protocol tolerates packet losses, residual bit errors,
      and out-of-order delivery on the link over which header
      compression takes place, without losing additional packets or
      introducing additional errors in decompressed headers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Compression transparency

      The compression transparency is a measure of the extent to which
      the scheme maintains the semantics of the original headers.  If
      all decompressed headers are bitwise identical to the
      corresponding original headers, the scheme is transparent.
	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Developing the ROHC Protocol</h3></a>

   The challenge in developing a header compression protocol is to
   conciliate compression efficiency and robustness while maintaining
   transparency, as increasing robustness will always come at the
   expense of a lower compression efficiency, and vice versa.  The
   scheme should also be flexible enough in its design to minimize the
   impacts from the varying round-trip times and loss patterns of links
   where header compression will be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To achieve this, the header compression scheme must provide
   facilities for the decompressor to verify decompression and detect
   potential context damage, as well as context recovery mechanisms such
   as feedback.  Header compression schemes prior to the ones developed
   by the Robust Header Compression (ROHC) Working Group (WG) were not
   designed with the above high-level objectives in mind.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ROHC WG has developed header compression solutions to meet the
   needs of present and future link technologies.  While special
   attention has been put towards meeting the more stringent
   requirements stemming from the characteristics of wireless links, the
   results are equally applicable to many other link technologies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Framework and four profiles: RTP,
   UDP, ESP, and uncompressed" [RFC3095] was published in 2001, as the
   first output of the ROHC WG.  ROHC is a general and extendable
   framework for header compression, on top of which profiles can be
   defined for compression of different protocols headers.  RFC 3095
   introduced a number of new compression techniques, and was successful
   at living up to the requirements placed on it, as described in
   [RFC3096].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interoperability testing of RFC 3095 confirms the capabilities of
   ROHC to meet its purposes, but feedback from implementers has also
   indicated that the protocol specification is complex and sometimes
   obscure.  Most importantly, a clear distinction between framework and
   profiles is not obvious in [RFC3095], which also makes development of
   additional profiles troublesome.  This document therefore aims at
   explicitly specifying the ROHC framework, while a companion document
   [RFC5225] specifies revised versions of the compression profiles of
   RFC 3095.
	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Operational Characteristics of the ROHC Channel</h3></a>

   Robust header compression can be used over many types of link
   technologies.  The ROHC framework provides flexibility for profiles
   to address a wide range of applications, and this section lists some
   of the operational characteristics of the ROHC channel (see also
   [RFC3759]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Multiplexing over a single logical channel

      The ROHC channel provides a mechanism to identify a context within
      the general ROHC packet format.  The CID makes it possible for a
      logical channel that supports ROHC to transport multiple header-
      compressed flows, while still making it possible for a channel to
      be dedicated to one single packet flow without any CID overhead.
      More specifically, ROHC uses a distinct CID space per logical
      channel, and the CID can be omitted for one of the flows over the
      ROHC channel when configured to use a small CID space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Establishment of channel parameters

      A link layer defining support for the ROHC channel must provide
      the means to establish header compression channel parameters (see
      Section 5.1).  This can be achieved through a negotiation
      mechanism, static provisioning, or some out-of-band signaling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Packet type identification

      The ROHC channel defines a packet type identifier space, and puts
      restrictions with respect to the use of a number of identifiers
      that are common for all ROHC profiles.  Identifiers that have no
      restrictions, i.e., identifiers that are not defined by this
      document, are available to each profile.  The identifier is part
      of each compressed header, and this makes it possible for the link
      that supports the ROHC channel to allocate one single link-layer
      payload type for ROHC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Out-of-order delivery between compression endpoints

      Each profile defines its own level of robustness, including
      tolerance to reordering of packets before but especially between
      compression endpoints, if any.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For profiles specified in [RFC3095], the channel between the
      compressor and decompressor is required to maintain in-order
      delivery of the packets; i.e., the definition of these profiles
      assumes that the decompressor always receives packets in the same
      order as the compressor sent them.  The impacts of reordering on
      the performance of these profiles are described in [RFC4224].
      However, reordering before the compression point is handled, i.e.,
      these profiles make no assumption that the compressor will receive
      packets in order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For the ROHCv2 profiles specified in [RFC5225], their definitions
      assume that the decompressor can receive packets out of order,
      i.e., not in the same order that the compressor sent them.
      Reordering before the compression point is also dealt with.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Duplication of packets

      The link supporting the ROHC channel is required to not duplicate
      packets (however, duplication of packets can occur before they
      reach the compressor; i.e., there is no assumption that the
      compressor will receive only one copy of each packet).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Framing

      The link layer must provide framing that makes it possible to
      distinguish frame boundaries and individual frames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Error detection/protection

      ROHC profiles should be designed to cope with residual errors in
      the headers delivered to the decompressor.  CRCs are used to
      detect decompression failures and to prevent or reduce damage
      propagation.  However, it is recommended that lower layers deploy
      error detection for ROHC headers and that ROHC headers with high
      residual error rates not be delivered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Compression and Master Sequence Number (MSN)</h3></a>

   Compression of header fields is based on the establishment of a
   function to a sequence number, called the master sequence number
   (MSN).  This function describes the change pattern of the field with
   respect to a change in the MSN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Change patterns include, for example, fields that increase
   monotonically or by a small value, fields that seldom change, and
   fields that remain unchanging for the entire lifetime of the packet
   flow, in which case the function to the MSN is equivalent to a
   constant value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The compressor first establishes functions for each of the header
   fields, and then reliably communicates the MSN.  When the change
   pattern of the field does not match the established function, i.e.,
   the existing function gives a result that is different from the field
   in the header being compressed, additional information can be sent to
   update the parameters of that function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MSN is defined per profile.  It can be either derived directly
   from one of the fields of the protocol being compressed (e.g., the
   RTP SN [RFC5225]), or it can be created and maintained by the
   compressor (e.g., the MSN for compression of UDP in profile 0x0102
   [RFC5225] or the MSN in ROHC-TCP [RFC4996]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   Static and Dynamic Parts of a Context</h3></a>

   A compression context can be conceptually divided into two different
   parts, the static context and the dynamic context, each based on the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The static part includes the information necessary to compress and
   decompress the fields whose change behavior is classified as STATIC,
   STATIC-KNOWN, or STATIC-DEF (as described in Section 4.1 above).

   handle multiple compressed packet flows over the same channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, this section specifies encoding methods used in the packet

	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1   Contexts and Context Identifiers</h4></a>

   Associated with each compressed flow is a context.  The context is
   the state that the compressor and the decompressor maintain in order
   to correctly compress or decompress the headers of the packet in the
   flow.  Each context is identified using a CID.
   A context is considered to be a new context when the CID is
   associated with a profile for the first time since the creation of
   the ROHC channel, or when the CID gets associated from the reception
   of an IR (this does not apply to the IR-DYN) with a different profile
   than the profile in the context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Context information is conceptually kept in a table.  The context
   table is indexed using the CID, which is sent along with compressed
   headers and feedback information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CID space can be either small, which means that CIDs can take the
   values 0 through 15, or large, which means that CIDs take values
   between 0 and 2^14 - 1 = 16383.  Whether the CID space is large or
   small MUST be established, possibly by negotiation, before any
   compressed packet may be sent over the ROHC channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CID space is distinct for each channel, i.e., CID 3 over channel
   A and CID 3 over channel B do not refer to the same context, even if
   the endpoints of A and B are the same nodes.  In particular, CIDs for
   any pair of ROHC channels are not related (two associated ROHC
   channels serving as feedback channels for one another do not even
   need to have CID spaces of the same size).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.2"><h4>5.1.2   Per-Channel Parameters</h4></a>

   The ROHC channel is based on a number of parameters that form part of
   the established channel state and the per-context state.  The state
   of the ROHC channel MUST be established before the first ROHC packet
   may be sent, which may be achieved using negotiation protocols
   provided by the link layer (see also [RFC3241], which describes an
   option for negotiation of ROHC parameters for PPP).  This section
   describes some of this channel state information in an abstract way:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   LARGE_CIDS: Boolean; if false, the small CID representation (0 octets
   or 1 prefix octet, covering CID 0 to 15) is used; if true, the large
   CID representation (1 or 2 embedded CID octets covering CID 0 to
   16383) is used.  See also Section 5.1.1 and Section 5.2.1.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MAX_CID: Non-negative integer; highest CID number to be used by the
   compressor (note that this parameter is not coupled to, but in effect
   further constrained by, LARGE_CIDS).  This value represents an
   agreement by the decompressor that it can provide sufficient memory
   resources to host at least MAX_CID+1 contexts; the decompressor MUST
   maintain established contexts within this space until either the CID
   gets re-used by the establishment of a new context, or until the
   channel is taken down.
   PROFILES: Set of non-negative integers, where each integer indicates
   a profile supported by both the compressor and the decompressor.  A
   profile is identified by a 16-bit value, where the 8 LSB bits
   indicate the actual profile, and the 8 MSB bits indicate the variant
   of that profile.  The ROHC compressed header format identifies the
   profile used with only the 8 LSB bits; this means that if multiple
   variants of the same profile are available for a ROHC channel, the
   PROFILES set after negotiation MUST NOT include more than one variant
   of the same profile.  The compressor MUST NOT compress using a
   profile that is not in PROFILES.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   FEEDBACK_FOR: Optional reference to a ROHC channel in the opposite
   direction between the same compression endpoints.  If provided, this
   parameter indicates to which other ROHC channel any feedback sent on
   this ROHC channel refers (see [RFC3759]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MRRU: Non-negative integer.  Maximum Reconstructed Reception Unit.
   This is the size of the largest reconstructed unit in octets that the
   decompressor is expected to reassemble from segments (see
   Section 5.2.5).  This size includes the segmentation CRC.  If MRRU is

   As part of the negotiated channel parameters, the compressor and

   MAX_CID, the decompressor also agrees to provide memory resources to
   host at least MAX_CID+1 contexts, and an established context with a

   Feedback carries information from the decompressor to the compressor.
   Feedback can be sent over a ROHC channel that operates in the same

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The general ROHC packet format allows transport of feedback using

   CID information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The feedback information sent on a particular channel is passed
      to, and interpreted by, the compressor associated with feedback on
      that channel.  Thus, each feedback element contains CID
      information from the channel for which the feedback is sent.  The
      ROHC feedback scheme thus requires that a channel carries feedback
      to at most one compressor.  How a compressor is associated with
      the feedback for a particular channel is outside the scope of this
      specification.  See also [RFC3759].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Length information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The length of a feedback element can be determined by examining
      the first few octets of the feedback.  This enables piggybacking

      element in a packet.  The length information thus decouples the
      decompressor from the associated same-side compressor, as the
      decompressor can extract the feedback information from the

      extracted information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The association between compressor-decompressor pairs operating in

   for each packet flow, and SHOULD use a CID value that was not
   previously associated with the profile used to compress the flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4.3"><h4>5.4.3   Context Initialization</h4></a>

   The compressor initializes the static context associated with the
   UNCOMPRESSED profile by sending IR packets (see Section 5.4.1).
   During context initialization, it is RECOMMENDED that the compressor
   sends IR packets until it is reasonably confident that the
   decompressor has successfully received at least one IR packet.  For
   example, this confidence can be based on feedback from the
   decompressor, or on knowledge of the characteristics of the link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The compressor SHOULD periodically transmit IR packets for a context
   associated with the UNCOMPRESSED profile, at least until it receives
   feedback from the decompressor for that context.  The compressor MAY
   stop the periodic sending of IR packets once it has received
   feedback.
	<a name="section-5.4.4"><h4>5.4.4   Decompressor Operation</h4></a>

   When an IR packet is received, the decompressor first validates its
   header using the 8-bit CRC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   If the header fails validation, the decompressor MUST NOT deliver
       the IP packet to upper layers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   If the header is successfully validated, the decompressor

       1.  initializes the context if it has no valid context for the
           given CID already associated to the specified profile,

       2.  delivers the IP packet to upper layers if present,

       3.  MAY send an ACK.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When any other packet is received while the decompressor has no
   context, it is discarded without further action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a Normal packet is received and the decompressor has a valid
   context, the IP packet is extracted and delivered to upper layers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4.5"><h4>5.4.5   Feedback</h4></a>

   The only kind of feedback defined by Profile 0x0000 is ACK, using the
   FEEDBACK-1 format of Section 5.2.4.1, where the value of the profile-
   specific octet in the FEEDBACK-1 is 0 (zero).  The FEEDBACK-2 format
   is thus not defined for Profile 0x0000.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Overview of a ROHC Profile (Informative)</h2></a>

   The ROHC protocol consists of a framework part and a profile part.
   The framework defines the mechanisms common to all profiles, while
   the profile defines the compression algorithm and profile-specific
   packet formats.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 5 specifies the details of the ROHC framework.  This section
   provides an informative overview of the elements that make a profile
   specification.  The normative specification of individual profiles is
   outside the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A ROHC profile defines the elements that build up the compression
   protocol.  A ROHC profile consists of:
   Packet formats:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Bits-on-the-wire

         The profile defines the layout of the bits for profile-specific
         packet types that it defines, and for the profile-specific
         parts of packet types common to all profiles (e.g., IR and IR-
         DYN).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Field encodings

         Bits and groups of bits from the packet format layout, referred
         to as Compressed fields, represent the result of an encoding
         method specific for that compressed field within a specific
         packet format.  The profile defines these encoding methods.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Updating properties

         The profile-specific packet formats may update the state of the
         decompressor, and may do so in different ways.  The profile
         defines how individual profile-specific fields, or entire
         profile-specific packet types, update the decompressor context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Verification

         Packets that update the state of the decompressor are verified
         to prevent incorrect updates to the decompressor context.  The
         profile defines the mechanisms used to verify the decompression
         of a packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Context management:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Robustness logic

         Packets may be lost or reordered between the compressor and the
         decompressor.  The profile defines mechanisms to minimize the
         impacts of such events and prevent damage propagation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Repair mechanism

         Despite the robustness logic, impairment events may still lead
         to decompression failure(s), and even to context damage at the
         decompressor.  The profile defines context repair mechanisms,
         including feedback logic if used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   An IANA registry for "RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Profile
   Identifiers" [ROHC-ids] was created by RFC 3095 [RFC3095].  The
   assignment policy, as outlined by RFC 3095, is the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ROHC profile identifier is a non-negative integer.  In many
   negotiation protocols, it will be represented as a 16-bit value.  Due
   to the way the profile identifier is abbreviated in ROHC packets, the
   8 LSBs of the profile identifier have a special significance: Two
   profile identifiers with identical 8 LSBs should be assigned only if
   the higher-numbered one is intended to supersede the lower-numbered
   one.  To highlight this relationship, profile identifiers should be
   given in hexadecimal (for example, as in 0x1234, which would
   supersede 0x0A34).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], the IANA policy for
   assigning new values for the profile identifier is Specification
   Required: values and their meanings must be documented in an RFC or
   in some other permanent and readily available reference, in
   sufficient detail that interoperability between independent
   implementations is possible.  In the 8 LSBs, the range 0 to 127 is
   reserved for IETF standard-track specifications; the range 128 to 254
   is available for other specifications that meet this requirement
   (such as Informational RFCs).  The LSB value 255 is reserved for
   future extensibility of the present specification.
   The following profile identifiers have so far been allocated:

   but this document does not require any additional IANA action.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Because encryption eliminates the redundancy that header compression
   schemes try to exploit, there is some inducement to forego encryption
   of headers in order to enable operation over low-bandwidth links.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A malfunctioning or malicious header compressor could cause the
   header decompressor to reconstitute packets that do not match the
   original packets but still have valid headers and possibly also valid
   transport checksums.  Such corruption may be detected with end-to-end
   authentication and integrity mechanisms, which will not be affected
   by the compression.  Moreover, the ROHC header compression scheme
   uses an internal checksum for verification of reconstructed headers,
   which reduces the probability of producing decompressed headers not
   matching the original ones without this being noticed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Denial-of-service attacks are possible if an intruder can introduce,
   for example, bogus IR, IR-DYN, or feedback packets onto the link and
   thereby cause compression efficiency to be reduced.  However, an
   intruder having the ability to inject arbitrary packets at the link
   layer in this manner raises additional security issues that dwarf
   those related to the use of header compression.
