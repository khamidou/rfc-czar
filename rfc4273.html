</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The origin of this memo is from RFC 1269 "Definitions of Managed
   Objects for the Border Gateway Protocol (Version 3)", which was
   updated to support BGP-4 in RFC 1657.  This memo fixes errors
   introduced when the MIB module was converted to use the SMIv2
   language.  This memo also updates references to the current SNMP
   framework documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo is intended to document deployed implementations of this
   MIB module in a historical context, to provide clarifications of some
   items, and to note errors where the MIB module fails to fully
   represent the BGP protocol.  Work is currently in progress to replace
   this MIB module with a new one representing the current state of the
   BGP protocol and its extensions.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [BGP4, BGP4APP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo obsoletes RFC 1657 and RFC 1269.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h2></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Apart from a few system-wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into
   three tables: the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute
   Table, and the BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table.  The BGP Peer
   Table contains information about state and current activity of
   connections with the BGP peers.  The BGP Received Path Attribute
   Table contains path attributes received from all peers running BGP
   version 3 or less.  The BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table contains
   path attributes received from all BGP-4 peers.  The actual attributes
   used in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute
   tables after local routing policy has been applied.

            DESCRIPTION
                   "Changes from RFC 1657:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                    1) Fixed the definitions of the notifications
                       to make them equivalent to their initial
                       definition in RFC 1269.
                    2) Added compliance and conformance info.
                    3) Updated information for the values of
                       bgpPeerNegotiatedVersion, bgp4PathAttrLocalPref,
                       bgp4PathAttrCalcLocalPref,

                       bgp4PathAttrASPathSegement.
                    4) Added additional clarification comments where
                       needed.
                    5) Noted where objects do not fully reflect
                       the protocol as Known Issues.
                    6) Updated the DESCRIPTION for the
                       bgp4PathAttrAtomicAggregate object.
                    7) The following objects have had their DESCRIPTION
                       clause modified to remove the text that suggested
                       (using 'should' verb) initializing the counter
                       to zero on a transition to the established state:
                         bgpPeerInUpdates, bgpPeerOutUpdates,
                         bgpPeerInTotalMessages, bgpPeerOutTotalMessages
                       Those implementations that still do this are
                       still compliant with this new wording.
                       Applications should not assume counters have
                       started at zero.

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This MIB relates to a system providing inter-domain routing.  As
   such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB
   may result in denial of service to a large number of end-users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are several management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   should be considered sensitive or vulnerable in most network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o bgpPeerAdminStatus

        Improper change of bgpPeerAdminStatus, from start to stop, can
        cause significant disruption of the connectivity to those
        portions of the Internet reached via the applicable remote BGP
        peer.
      o bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval

        Improper change of this object can cause connections to be
        disrupted for extremely long time periods when otherwise they
        would be restored in a relatively short period of time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured

        Misconfiguration of these objects can make BGP sessions more
        fragile and less resilient to denial of service attacks on the
        inter-domain routing system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval,
        bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval

        Misconfiguration of these objects may adversely affect global
        Internet convergence of the routes advertised by this BGP
        speaker.  This may result in long-lived routing loops and
        blackholes for the portions of the Internet that utilize these
        routes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that contain
   sensitive information regarding the operation of a network.  For
   example, a BGP peer's local and remote addresses might be sensitive
   for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on routers confidential
   in order to prevent router addresses used for a denial of service
   attack or spoofing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Therefore, it is important in most environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
