                 Inter-Area Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)
                 Segmented Label Switched Paths (LSPs)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) segmented service label switched paths (LSPs) by
   partitioning such LSPs into intra-area segments and using BGP as the
   inter-area routing and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  Within
   each IGP area, the intra-area segments are either carried over intra-
   area P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP hierarchy, or instantiated using
   ingress replication.  The intra-area P2MP LSPs may be signaled using
   P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP multipoint LDP (mLDP).  If ingress replication
   is used within an IGP area, then (multipoint-to-point) LDP LSPs or
   (point-to-point) RSVP-TE LSPs may be used in the IGP area.  The
   applications/services that use such inter-area service LSPs may be
   BGP Multicast VPN, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) multicast, or
   global table multicast over MPLS.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs
   into intra-area segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and
   label distribution protocol.  Within each IGP area, the intra-area
   segments are either carried over intra-area P2MP LSPs, potentially
   using P2MP LSP hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication.
   The intra-area P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875]
   or P2MP mLDP [RFC6388].  If ingress replication is used in an IGP
   area, then (multipoint-to-point) LDP LSPs [RFC5036] or (point-to-
   point) RSVP-TE LSPs [RFC3209] may be used within the IGP area.  The
   applications/services that use such inter-area service LSPs may be
   BGP Multicast VPN (BGP MVPN), VPLS multicast, or global table
   multicast over MPLS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The primary use case of such segmented P2MP service LSPs is when the
   Provider Edge (PE) routers are in different areas but in the same
   Autonomous System (AS) and thousands or more of PEs require P2MP
   connectivity.  For instance, this may be the case when MPLS is pushed
   further to the metro edge and the metros are in different IGP areas.
   This may also be the case when a service provider's network comprises
   multiple IGP areas in a single AS, with a large number of PEs.
   Seamless MPLS is the industry term to address this case
   [SEAMLESS-MPLS].  Thus, one of the applicabilities of this document
   is that it describes the multicast procedures for seamless MPLS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is to be noted that [RFC6514] and [RFC7117] already specify
   procedures for building segmented inter-AS P2MP service LSPs.  This
   document complements those procedures, as it extends the segmented
   P2MP LSP model such that it is applicable to inter-area P2MP service
   LSPs as well.  In fact, an inter-AS deployment could use inter-AS
   segmented P2MP LSPs as specified in [RFC6514] and [RFC7117] where
   each intra-AS segment is constructed using inter-area segmented P2MP
   LSPs, as specified in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Specification of Requirements</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   General Assumptions and Terminology</h2></a>

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with MVPN procedures and
   terminology [RFC6513] [RFC6514] and VPLS procedures and terminology
   [RFC7117].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document allows Area Border Routers (ABRs), acting as Route
   Reflectors, to follow the procedures specified in [SEAMLESS-MPLS]
   when handling the BGP Next Hop of the routes to the PEs.
   Specifically, when reflecting such routes from the non-backbone areas
   into the backbone area, the ABRs MUST set the BGP Next Hop to their
   own loopback addresses (next-hop-self), while when reflecting such
   routes from the backbone area into the non-backbone areas, the ABRs
   SHOULD NOT change the BGP Next Hop addresses (next-hop-unchanged).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While this document allows ABRs to follow the procedures specified in
   [SEAMLESS-MPLS], procedures specified in this document are applicable
   even when ABRs do not follow the procedures specified in
   [SEAMLESS-MPLS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies a particular way of supporting the global
   table multicast service.  Although the document refers to this
   approach simply as "global table multicast", it does not mean to
   imply that there are no other ways to support global table multicast.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An alternative way to support global table multicast is to use the
   procedures for MVPN that are specified in [RFC6514] and in this
   document.  That alternative is discussed in more detail in [GTM].
   However, that alternative is not further considered in the current
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document assumes that, in the context of global table multicast,
   ABRs do not carry routes to the destinations external to their own
   AS.  Furthermore, in the context of global table multicast, this
   document assumes that an Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR), when
   re-advertising into Internal BGP (IBGP) routes received from an
   external speaker (received via External BGP (EBGP)), may not change
   the BGP Next Hop to self.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Within an AS, a P2MP service LSP is partitioned into three segments:
   ingress area segment, backbone area segment, and egress area segment.
   Within each area, a segment is carried over an intra-area P2MP LSP or
   instantiated using ingress replication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When intra-area P2MP LSPs are used to instantiate the intra-area
   segments, there could be either 1:1 or n:1 mapping between intra-area
   segments of the inter-area P2MP service LSP and a given intra-area
   P2MP LSP.  The latter is realized using P2MP LSP hierarchy with
   upstream-assigned labels [RFC5331].  For simplicity of presentation,
   we assume that P2MP LSP hierarchy is used even with 1:1 mapping; in
   which case, an Implicit NULL is used as the upstream-assigned label.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When intra-area segments of the inter-area P2MP service LSP are
   instantiated using ingress replication, multiple such segments may be
   carried in the same P2P RSVP-TE or MP2P LDP LSP.  This can be
   achieved using downstream-assigned labels alone.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ingress area segment of a P2MP service LSP is rooted at a PE (or
   at an ASBR in the case where the P2MP service LSP spans multiple
   ASes).  The leaves of this segment are other PEs/ASBRs and ABRs in
   the same area as the root PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The backbone area segment is rooted at either an ABR that is
   connected to the ingress area (ingress ABR), an ASBR if the ASBR is
   present in the backbone area, or a PE if the PE is present in the
   backbone area.  The backbone area segment has its leaf ABRs that are
   connected to the egress area(s) or PEs in the backbone area, or ASBRs
   in the backbone area.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The egress area segment is rooted at an ABR in the egress area
   (egress ABR), and has its leaf PEs and ASBR in that egress area (the
   latter covers the case where the P2MP service LSP spans multiple
   ASes).  For a given P2MP service LSP, note that there may be more
   than one backbone segment, each rooted at its own ingress ABR, and
   more than one egress area segment, each rooted at its own egress ABR.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document uses the term "A-D routes" for "auto-discovery routes".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An implementation that supports this document MUST implement the
   procedures described in the following sections to support inter-area
   P2MP segmented service LSPs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Inter-Area P2MP Segmented Next-Hop Extended Community</h2></a>

   This document defines a new Transitive IPv4-Address-Specific Extended
   Community Sub-Type: "Inter-Area P2MP Next-Hop".  This document also
   defines a new BGP Transitive IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community
   Sub-Type: "Inter-Area P2MP Next-Hop".
   A PE, an ABR, or an ASBR constructs the Inter-Area P2MP Segmented
   Next-Hop Extended Community as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The Global Administrator field MUST be set to an IP address of the
      PE, ABR, or ASBR that originates or advertises the route carrying
      the P2MP Next-Hop Extended Community.  For example this address
      may be the loopback address or the PE, ABR, or ASBR that
      advertises the route.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The Local Administrator field MUST be set to 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the Global Administrator field is an IPv4 address, the
      IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community is used; if the Global
      Administrator field is an IPv6 address, the IPv6-Address-Specific
      Extended Community is used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The detailed usage of these Extended Communities is described in
      the following sections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Discovering P2MP FEC of Inter-Area P2MP Service LSP</h2></a>

   Each inter-area P2MP service LSP has associated with it P2MP
   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).  The egress PEs need to learn
   this P2MP FEC in order to initiate the creation of the egress area
   segment of the P2MP inter-area service LSP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The P2MP FEC of the inter-area P2MP LSP is learned by the egress PEs
   either by configuration or based on the application-specific
   procedures (e.g., MVPN-specific procedures or VPLS-specific
   procedures).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   BGP MVPN</h3></a>

   Egress PEs and/or ASBRs discover the P2MP FEC of the service LSPs
   used by BGP MVPN using the Inclusive Provider Multicast Service
   Interface (I-PMSI) or Selective PMSI (S-PMSI) A-D routes that are
   originated by the ingress PEs or ASBRs following the procedures of
   [RFC6514], along with modifications as described in this document.
   The Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of such routes
   encodes the P2MP FEC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The procedures in this document require that at least one ABR in a
   given IGP area act as a Route Reflector for MVPN A-D routes.  Such a
   Router Reflector is responsible for re-advertising MVPN A-D routes
   across area boundaries.  When re-advertising these routes across area
   boundaries, this Route Reflector MUST follow the procedures in this
   document.  Note that such a Route Reflector may also re-advertise
   MVPN A-D routes within the same area; in which case, it follows the
   plain BGP Route Reflector procedures [RFC4456].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1   Routes Originated by PE or ASBR</h4></a>

   The "Leaf Information Required" flag MUST be set in the PMSI Tunnel
   attribute carried in the MVPN A-D routes, when originated by the
   ingress PEs or ASBRs, except for the case where (a) as a matter of
   policy (provisioned on the ingress PEs or ASBRs) there is no
   aggregation of ingress area segments of the service LSPs and (b) mLDP
   is used as the protocol to establish intra-area transport LSPs in the
   ingress area.  Before any Leaf A-D route is advertised by a PE or ABR
   in the same area, as described in the following sections, an
   I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D route is advertised either with an explicit Tunnel
   Type and Tunnel Identifier in the PMSI Tunnel attribute, if the
   Tunnel Identifier has already been assigned, or with a special Tunnel
   Type of "No tunnel information present" otherwise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.2"><h4>5.1.2   Routes Re-advertised by PE or ASBR</h4></a>

   When the I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D routes are re-advertised by an ingress
   ABR, the "Leaf Information Required" flag MUST be set in the PMSI
   Tunnel attribute present in the routes, except for the case where
   (a) as a matter of policy (provisioned on the ingress ABR) there is
   no aggregation of backbone area segments of the service LSPs and
   (b) mLDP is used as the protocol to establish intra-area transport
   LSPs in the backbone area.  Likewise, when the I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D
   routes are re-advertised by an egress ABR, the "Leaf Information
   Required" flag MUST be set in the PMSI Tunnel attribute present in
   the routes, except for the case where (a) as a matter of policy
   (provisioned on the egress ABR) there is no aggregation of egress

   service LSP in an intra-area P2MP LSP (referred to as the "outer"

   sender PE.  Note that MVPN intra-AS I-PMSI A-D routes and S-PMSI A-D
   routes both carry the Originating Router's IP Address.  Thus, an
   egress PE could associate the data arriving on P-tunnels advertised
   by these routes with the Originating Router's IP Address carried by
   these routes, which is the same as the ingress PE.  Since a unique

   Use of inter-area transport P2MP LSPs, as described in this section,
   creates a level of indirection between (inter-area) P2MP service
   LSPs, and intra-area transport LSPs that carry the service LSPs.
   Rather than segmenting (inter-area) service P2MP LSPs, and then
   aggregating (intra-area) segments of these service LSPs into intra-
   area transport LSPs, this approach first aggregates multiple (inter-
   area) service P2MP LSPs into a single inter-area transport P2MP LSP,
   then segments such inter-area transport P2MP LSPs, and then
   aggregates (intra-area) segments of these inter-area transport LSPs
   into intra-area transport LSPs.
   On one hand, this approach could result in reducing the state (and
   the overhead associated with maintaining the state) on ABRs.  This is
   because instead of requiring ABRs to maintain state for individual
   P2MP service LSPs, ABRs would need to maintain state only for the
   inter-area P2MP transport LSPs.  Note, however, that this reduction
   is possible only if a single inter-area P2MP transport LSP aggregates
   more than one (inter-area) service LSP.  In the absence of such
   aggregation, use of inter-area transport LSPs provides no benefits,
   yet results in extra overhead.  And while such aggregation does allow
   reduced state on ABRs, it comes at a price, as described below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As we mentioned before, aggregating multiple P2MP service LSPs into a
   single inter-area P2MP transport LSP requires the PE rooted at these
   LSPs to determine all the leaf nodes of the service LSPs to be
   aggregated.  This means that the root PE has to track all the leaf
   PEs of these LSPs.  In contrast, when one applies segmentation
   procedures directly to the P2MP service LSPs, the root PE has to
   track only the leaf PEs in its own IGP area, plus the ingress ABR(s).
   Likewise, an ingress ABR has to track only the egress ABRs.  Finally,
   an egress ABR has to track only the leaf PEs in its own area.
   Therefore, while the total overhead of leaf tracking due to the P2MP
   service LSPs is about the same in both approaches, the distribution
   of this overhead is different.  Specifically, when one uses inter-
   area P2MP transport LSPs, this overhead is concentrated on the
   ingress PE.  When one applies segmentation procedures directly to the
   P2MP service LSPs, this overhead is distributed among the ingress PE
   and ABRs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Moreover, when one uses inter-area P2MP transport LSPs, ABRs have to
   bear the overhead of leaf tracking for inter-area P2MP transport
   LSPs.  In contrast, when one applies segmentation procedures directly
   to the P2MP service LSPs, there is no such overhead (as there are no
   inter-area P2MP transport LSPs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of inter-area P2MP transport LSPs may also result in more
   bandwidth inefficiency, as compared to applying segmentation
   procedures directly to the P2MP service LSPs.  This is because with
   inter-area P2MP transport LSPs the ABRs aggregate segments of inter-
   area P2MP transport LSPs, rather than segments of (inter-area) P2MP
   service LSPs.  To illustrate this, consider the following example.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Assume PE1 in Area 1 is an ingress PE, with two multicast streams,
   (C-S1, C-G1) and (C-S2, C-G2), originated by an MVPN site connected
   to PE1.  Assume that PE2 in Area 2 has an MVPN site with receivers
   for (C-S1, C-G1), PE3 and PE4 in Area 3 have an MVPN site with
   receivers for both (C-S1, C-G1) and (C-S2, C-G2).  Finally, assume
   that PE5 in Area 4 has an MVPN site with receivers for (C-S2, C-G2).
   When segmentation applies directly to the P2MP service LSPs, Area 2
   would have just one intra-area transport LSP that would carry the
   egress area segment of the P2MP service LSP for (C-S1, C-G1); Area 3
   would have just one intra-area transport LSP that would carry the
   egress area segments of both the P2MP service LSP for (C-S1, C-G1)
   and the P2MP service LSP for (C-S2, C-G2); Area 4 would have just one
   intra-area transport LSP that would carry the egress area segment of
   the P2MP service LSP for (C-S2, C-G2).  Note that there is no
   bandwidth inefficiency in this case at all.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using inter-area P2MP transport LSPs, to achieve the same state
   overhead on the routers within each of the egress areas (except for
   egress ABRs), PE1 would need to aggregate the P2MP service LSP for
   (C-S1, C-G1) and the P2MP service LSP for (C-S2, C-G2) into the same
   inter-area P2MP transport LSP.  While such aggregation would reduce
   state on ABRs, it would also result in bandwidth inefficiency, as
   (C-S1, C-G1) will be delivered not just to PE2, PE3, and PE4, but
   also to PE5, which has no receivers for this stream.  Likewise,
   (C-S2, C-G2) will be delivered not just to PE3, PE4, and PE5, but

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-16"><h2>16.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Procedures described in this document are subject to security threats
   similar to those experienced by any MPLS deployment.  It is
   recommended that baseline security measures are considered as
   described in "Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks"
   [RFC5920], in the mLDP specification [RFC6388], and in the P2MP
   RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209].  The security considerations of
   [RFC6513] are also applicable.
