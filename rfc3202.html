	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   The SNMP Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
      1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
      [12].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [13].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions</h2></a>

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [22].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   This MIB module addresses the items required to manage the Frame
   Relay Forum's Implementation Agreement for Service Level Definitions
   (FRF.13 [17]).  At present, this applies to these values of the
   ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  frameRelay (32)

   o  frameRelayService (44)
   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Frame Relay Service Level Definitions</h3></a>

   The frame relay service level definitions address specific
   characteristics of a frame relay service that can be used to
   facilitate the following tasks:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Evaluation of frame relay service providers, offerings or
      products.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Measurement of Quality of Service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Enforcement of Service Level Agreements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Planning or describing a frame relay network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following parameters are defined in FRF.13 [17] as a sufficient
   set of values to accomplish the tasks previously stated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Delay - The amount of time elapsed, in microseconds, from the time
      a frame exits the source to the time it reaches the destination.
      NOTE: FRF.13 [17] defines this value in terms of milliseconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Frame Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the number of frames delivered
      to the destination versus the number of frames sent by the source.
      This ratio can be further divided by inspecting either only the
      frames within the CIR or only the frames in excess of the CIR.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Data Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the amount of data delivered to
      the destination versus the amount of data sent by the source.
      This ratio can be further divided by inspecting either only the
      data within the CIR or only the data in excess of the CIR.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Service Availability - The amount of time the frame relay service
      was not available.  There are three types of availability
      statistics defined in FRF.13 [17]: Mean Time to Repair, Virtual
      Connection Availability, and Mean Time Between Service Outages.
      The later two require information about the scheduled outage time.
      It is assumed that scheduled outage time information will be
      maintained by the network management software, so it is not
      included in the MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Consult FRF.13 [17] for more details.
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Terminology</h3></a>

   o  CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber data
      rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to
      deliver under normal network conditions [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Logical Port - This term is used to model the Frame Relay
      "interface" on a device [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  NNI - Network to Network Interface [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that has
      its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription
      time [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reference Point (RP) - The point of reference within the network
      model at which the calculations or data collection takes place.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  UNI - User to Network Interface [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Network Model</h3></a>

   The basic model, as illustrated in figure 1 below, contains two frame
   relay DTE endpoints connected to a network cloud via a frame relay
   UNI interface.  The network cloud can contain zero or more internal
   frame relay NNI connections that interconnect multiple networks.  The
   calculations and data collection can be performed at any reference
   point within the network.

                    Frame Relay Network Reference Model
	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Reference Points</h3></a>

   The collection and calculations of the service level definitions
   apply to two reference points within the network.  These two points
   are the locations where the frames are referenced in the collection
   of the service level specific information.  The reference points used
   in the MIB module are shown in figure 2 below.  For completeness, the
   module also allows for proprietary reference points which MAY exist
   anywhere in the network that is not a previously defined reference
   point.  The meaning of the proprietary reference points is
   insignificant unless defined by the device manufacturer.

                     Reference Points (FRF.13 [17])
   The MIB variables frsldPvcCtrlTransmitRP and frsldPvcCtrlReceiveRP
   allow the user to view and configure the reference points at which
   the calculations occur.  These variables are specific to the device
   on which they are located.  Frame relay devices act as both frame
   sources and frame destinations.  The definitions in this MIB module
   apply to the interaction of a pair of devices on the network path.
   The same device can potentially use different reference points for
   calculation and collection of the statistics based on whether the
   referenced frame is sent or received by the device.  When the device
   is acting as a frame source, the value of frsldPvcCtrlTransmitRP
   reflects the reference point used for all source calculations
   pertaining to the specified PVC.  When the device is acting as a
   frame destination, the value of frsldPvcCtrlReceiveRP reflects the
   reference point used for all destination calculations pertaining to
   the specified PVC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, FRF.13 [17] defines an Edge-to-Edge Egress Queue
   measurement domain as a domain in which measurement is performed
   between an Ingress Reference Point and an Egress Queue Input
   Reference Point.  For this domain between a source device and a
   destination device, the value of frsldPvcCtrlTransmitRP for the
   source device would be set to ingTxLocalRP(2) and the value of<br>
   frsldPvcCtrlReceiveRP for the destination device would be set to
   eqiRxLocalRP(4).  While it is usually the case that the reference<br>
   points would be equivalent on the remote device when monitoring
   frames going in the opposite direction, there is no requirement for
   them to be so.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It can be seen from the above example that a total of four reference
   points are required in order to collect information for both
   directions of traffic flow.  The reference points represent the
   transmit and receive directions at both ends of a PVC.  If a device
   has knowledge of the information from the remote device, it is
   possible to collect the statistics from a single device.  This is not
   always the case.  In most instances, two devices will need to be
   monitored to capture a complete description of the service level on a
   PVC.  The reference points a single device is capable of monitoring
   are contained in the frsldRPCaps object.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5   Measurement Methodology</h3></a>

   This document neither recommends nor suggests a method of
   implementation.  This is left to the device manufacturer and should
   be independent of the data that is actually collected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Periodic collection of this data can be performed through either
   polling of the data table, use of the sample tables or use of the
   user history group of RFC 2021 [19].
	<a name="section-3.6"><h3>3.6   Theory of Operation</h3></a>

   The following sections describe how to use this MIB module.  They
   include row handling, data collection and data calculation.  The
   recommendations here in are suggestions as to implementation and do
   not infer that they are the only method that can be used to perform
   such operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.6.1"><h4>3.6.1   Capabilities Discovery</h4></a>

   Three objects are provided specifically to aid the network manager in
   discovering the capabilities of the device with respect to this MIB
   module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  frsldPvcCtrlWriteCaps  This object reports the write capabilities

   The performance of a PVC is monitored by evaluating the uni-
   directional flow of frames from an ingress point to an egress point.
   Reference points describe where each of the two measurements are
   made.  Monitoring both of the uni-directional flows that make-up the
   PVC frame traffic requires a total of four reference points as shown
   in Figures 3 through 5.  A monitoring point that evaluates traffic is
   restricted to counting frames that pass the reference points hosted
   locally on the monitoring point.  Thus, if the monitoring point is
   near the ingress point of the flow, it will count the frames entering
   into the frame relay network.  The complete picture of frame loss for
   the uni-directional flow requires information from the downstream
   reference point located at another (remote) monitoring point.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The local monitoring point MAY be implemented in such way that the
   information from the downstream monitoring point is moved to the
   local monitoring point using implementation-specific mechanisms.  In
   this case all information required to calculate frame loss becomes
   available from the local measurement point.  The local measurement
   point agent is capable of reporting all the objects in the
   FrsldPvcDataEntry row - the counts for offered frames entering the
   network and delivered frames exiting the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Alternatively, the local monitoring point MAY be restricted to counts
   of frames observed on the local device only.  In this case, the
   objects of the FrsldPvcDataEntry row reporting what happened on the
   remote device are not available.

   there may be some need to keep the historic information active for a
   short period after the destruction or removal of a DLCI.  If the

   The frame transfer delay is defined as the amount of time elapsed, in
   microseconds, from the time a frame exits the source to the time it
   reaches the destination.  The average delay can be found using the
   MIB variable described in DelayAvg above.  The delay may be
   calculated as either round trip or one way, and this information is
   held in the frsldPvcCtrlDelayType MIB variable.  If the delay be
   calculated as round trip, the value of DelayAvg represents the
   average of the total delays of the round trips.  In this case, the
   manager SHOULD divide the value returned by the agent by two to
   obtain the frame transfer delay.  In the case that
   frsldPvcCtrlDelayType is oneWay, the value of DelayAvg represents the
   average of the frame transfer delays and SHOULD be used as is.

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Relation to Other MIB Modules</h2></a>

   There is no explicit relation to any other frame relay MIB module nor
   are any required to implement this MIB module.  However, there is a
   need for knowledge of ifIndexes and some understanding of DLCIs.  The
   ifIndex information can be found in the IF-MIB [21] which is
   required.  The DLCI information can be found in either the Frame
   Relay DTE MIB (RFC 2115) [20] or the Frame Relay Network Services MIB
   (RFC 2954) [18]; however, neither is required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon setting of frsldPvcCtrlStatus in the frsldPvcCtrlTable to
   active(1) the system can be in one of the following three states:<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (1) The respective DLCI is known and is active.  This corresponds to<br>
       a state in which frPVCEndptRowStatus is active(1) and<br>
       frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus is either active(2) or none(4) for the<br>
       Frame Relay Network Services MIB (RFC 2954) [18].  For the Frame
       Relay DTE MIB, the same state is shown by frCircuitRowStatus of
       active(1) and  frCircuitState of active(2).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (2) The respective DLCI has not been created.  This corresponds to a<br>
       state in which the row with either frPVCEndptDLCIIndex or
       frCircuitDlci equal to the respective DLCI does not exist in
       either the frPVCEndptTable or the frCircuitTable respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (3) The respective DLCI has just been removed.  This corresponds to a<br>
       state in which either frPVCEndptRowStatus is no longer active(1)
       or frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus is no longer active(2) or none(4) for<br>
       the Frame Relay Network Services MIB (RFC 2954) [18].  For the
       Frame Relay DTE MIB, the same state is shown when either
       frCircuitRowStatus is no longer active(1) or frCircuitState is no<br>
       longer active(2).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the first case, the row in the frsldPvcDataTable will be filled.
   If frsldSmplCtrlStatus in the frsldSmplCtrlTable for the respective
   DLCI is also `active' the frsldPvcSampleTable will be filled as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the second case, the respective rows will not be added to any of
   the data or sample tables and frsldPvcCtrlStatus SHOULD report
   notReady(3).<br>
   For the third case, frsldPvcCtrlDeleteOnPurge should direct the
   behavior of the system.  If all tables are purged, this case will be
   equivalent to the second case above.  Otherwise, frsldPvcCtrlStatus
   SHOULD remain active(1).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Structure of the MIB Module</h2></a>

   The FRSLD-MIB consists of the following components:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  frsldPvcCtrlTable

   o  frsldSmplCtrlTable

   o  frsldPvcDataTable

   o  frsldPvcSampleTable

   o  frsldCapabilities

   Refer to the compliance statement defined within for a definition of
   what objects MUST be implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   frsldPvcCtrlTable</h3></a>

   The frsldPvcCtrlTable is the central control table for operations of
   the Frame Relay Service Level Definitions MIB.  It provides variables
   to control the parameters required to calculate the objects in the
   other tables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A row in this table MUST exist in order for a row to exist in any
   other table in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   frsldSmplCtrlTable</h3></a>

   This is an optional table to allow control of sampling of the data in
   the data table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   frsldPvcDataTable</h3></a>

   This table contains the calculated data.  It relies on configuration
   from the control table.
	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   frsldPvcSampleTable</h3></a>

   This table contains samples of the delivery and availability
   information from the data table as well as delay information
   calculated over the sample period.  It relies on configuration from
   both the control table and the sample control table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   frsldCapabilities</h3></a>

   This is a group of objects that define write capabilities of the
   read-create objects in the tables above.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Persistence of Data</h2></a>

   The data in frsldPvcCtrlTable and frsldSmplCtrlTable SHOULD persist
   through power cycles.  Note, however, that the symantics of readiness
   for the rows still applies.  This means that it is possible for a row
   to be reprovisioned as notReady(3) if the underlying DLCI does not<br>
   persist.  The data collected in the other tables SHOULD NOT persist
   through power cycles in that the reference TimeStamp is no longer
   valid.

	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
