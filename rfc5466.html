	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction and Overview</h2></a>

   Persistent named searches described in this document allow clients to
   save favorite searches on the server.  Such saved searches can save
   bandwidth for clients that need to regularly repeat them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The FILTERS IMAP extension adds a new FILTER search criterion for
   referencing persistent named searches (a.k.a. "filters"), as well as
   reuses GETMETADATA/SETMETADATA commands [METADATA] for listing/
   creating/updating/deleting such filters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A filter can be private (only accessible to the logged-in user) or
   public (accessible to all logged-in users).  Both a private and a
   public filter with the same name can exist at the same time.  If both
   filter types with the same name exist, the FILTER SEARCH criterion
   (see Section 3.1) MUST use the value of the private filter;
   otherwise, it MUST use the value of the filter that exists.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Let us call a pair of filter name and filter type a "typed filter".
   Each typed filter can have a value (which is a valid IMAP SEARCH
   criteria conforming to ABNF for the "search-criteria" non-terminal)
   and an optional human-readable description.  The SETMETADATA command
   creates or updates the value and/or the description of a typed
   filter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Values of all search keys stored in a filter MUST be encoded in
   UTF-8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Basic familiarity with the METADATA-SERVER extension [METADATA] and
   terms defined therein is required to understand this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IMAP Protocol Changes</h2></a>

   The IMAP extension for persistent named searches is present in any
   IMAP4 implementation that advertises "FILTERS" as one of the
   supported capabilities in the CAPABILITY response or response code.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   FILTER SEARCH Criterion</h3></a>

   The FILTER criterion for the SEARCH command allows a client to
   reference by name a filter stored on the server.  Such filter was
   created by setting the server annotation named "/private/filters/
   values/<filter_name>" (or the server annotation "/shared/filters/
   values/<filter_name>", if "/private/filters/values/<filter_name>"
   doesn't exist) using the SETMETADATA command as described in
   Section 3.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Syntax: FILTER <filter_name>

   When the named filter exists, its search criterion (i.e., the
   associated entry value) is inserted verbatim instead of the FILTER
   search-key.  For example, the following SEARCH command

   C: a SEARCH UID 300:900 FILTER on-the-road SINCE "3-Dec-2002"

   would be equivalent to the following

   C: a SEARCH UID 300:900 OR SMALLER 5000 FROM "boss@example.com"
   SINCE "3-Dec-2002"

   assuming the filter "on-the-road" exists and contains the value 'OR
   SMALLER 5000 FROM "boss@example.com"'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A reference to a nonexistent or unaccessible (e.g., due to access
   control restrictions) filter MUST cause failure of the SEARCH command
   with the tagged NO response that includes the UNDEFINED-FILTER
   response code followed by the name of the nonexistent/unaccessible
   filter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note the server SHOULD verify that each search criterion referenced
   by the FILTER search key is a full and correct search criterion.  For
   example, the server should fail the SEARCH command if its SEARCH
   criterion references a filter containing "OR SMALLER" search
   criterion, because this value is lacking one parameter and thus is
   not a fully specified search criterion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that a named filter itself can reference another filter using
   the FILTER search-key.  Implementations MUST be able to perform at
   least 3 substitution passes on the SEARCH command criterion.  If an
   implementation allows for more passes, it MUST implement some kind of
   loop detection.  If an implementation detects a loop or still sees a
   FILTER search-key after performing at least 3 substitutions, it MUST
   behave as if the specified filter doesn't exist (as described above).
   Note that use of the FILTER search key implies the CHARSET "UTF-8"
   parameter to the SEARCH/UID SEARCH command.  If the SEARCH/UID SEARCH
   command includes the explicit CHARSET parameter with the value other
   than "UTF-8" or "US-ASCII", then such command MUST result in the
   tagged BAD response from the server.  Such tagged response MUST
   contain the BADCHARSET response code (see [RFC3501]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Managing Filters Using SETMETADATA/GETMETADATA Commands</h3></a>

   Any server compliant with this document MUST either implement the
   METADATA-SERVER (or METADATA) [METADATA] extension, or implement
   SETMETADATA/GETMETADATA commands described in [METADATA] so that they
   work for the case of empty mailbox name (i.e., for managing server
   annotations) and for the entries specified in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document reserves two hierarchies of per-server entries under
   the "/private/filters/values" and "/shared/filters/values" roots (see
   [METADATA]) for storing filter values.  The value of a "/private/
   filters/values/<filter_name>" or a "/shared/filters/values/
   <filter_name>" server annotation is an IMAP SEARCH criteria,
   conforming to ABNF for the "search-criteria" non-terminal.  A name of
   a filter is governed by the ABNF for the "filter-name" non-terminal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that values of all search keys stored in these entries MUST be
   encoded in UTF-8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A new filter named "<filter_name>" can be created (or an existing
   filter can be modified) by storing a non-NIL value in the "/private/
   filters/values/<filter_name>" server entry (or in the "/shared/
   filters/values/<filter_name>") using the SETMETADATA [METADATA]
   command.  The server SHOULD verify that each search criterion stored
   in such a server entry is a full and correct search criterion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A filter can be deleted by storing the NIL value in both the
   "/private/filters/values/<filter_name>" and the "/shared/filters/
   values/<filter_name>" entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A filter can be renamed by first creating a filter with the new name
   (that has the same value as the old one) and then deleting the filter
   with the old one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If both "/private/filters/values/<filter_name>" and "/shared/filters/
   values/<filter_name>" server annotations exist, then the value of the
   "/private/filters/values/<filter_name>" is used when evaluating the
   corresponding FILTER SEARCH key (see Section 3.1).  Otherwise the
   non-NIL (existent) value is used.
   If the server is unable to create a new typed filter because the
   maximum number of allowed filters has already been reached, the
   server MUST return a tagged NO response with a "[METADATA TOOMANY]"
   response code, as defined in [METADATA].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           C: a007 SETMETADATA "" ("/private/filters/values/on-the-road"
               "OR SMALLER 5000 FROM \"boss@example.com\"")
           S: a007 OK SETMETADATA complete

   Client implementation note: As multiple clients might read and write
   filter values, it is possible that one client will use a SEARCH key
   that might not be recognized by another client that tries to present
   a user interface for editing a filter value.  In order to help other
   clients to (partially) parse filter values for editing purposes, a
   client storing a filter value SHOULD use () around any SEARCH key not
   defined in [RFC3501].  For example, if there is an IMAP extension
   that defines a new x-dsfa SEARCH key that takes 2 parameters, then
   the following SEARCH criterion 'from "@example.com>" x-dsfa from 5'
   should be stored as 'from "@example.com>" (x-dsfa from 5)'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that filter names are restricted to a subset of US-ASCII, as
   described in Section 4.  So they might not always be meaningful to
   users and thus not necessarily suitable for display purposes.  In
   order to help with storing human-readable descriptions of filters,
   this document also reserves two hierarchies of server entries under
   the "/private/filters/descriptions" and "/shared/filters/
   descriptions" roots.  The value of a "/private/filters/descriptions/
   <filter_name>" or a "/shared/filters/descriptions/<filter_name>"
   server annotation is a human-readable description for the
   <filter_name> filter, encoded in UTF-8 [UTF-8].  If the "/private/
   filters/descriptions/<filter_name>" server annotation exists, its
   value is used by the client as the filter description.  Otherwise,
   the value of the "/shared/filters/descriptions/<filter_name>" server
   annotation is used as the filter description.  In the absence of both
   the "/private/filters/descriptions/<filter_name>" and the "/shared/
   filters/descriptions/<filter_name>" entries, the client MAY display
   the name of the filter as its description.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The description string SHOULD be annotated with one or more language
   tags [RFC4646] as specified in Chapter 16.9 of [Unicode].  In the
   absence of any language tag, the "i-default" [RFC2277] language
   SHOULD be assumed.  Description in multiple languages MAY be present
   in a single description string.  This is done by concatenating
   descriptions in multiple languages into a single string, each
   description prefixed with its language tag, for example
   "<ru><...description in Russian...><fr-ca><...description in
   French...>".  Note that here <ru> is a language tag consisting of 3
   Unicode characters: <U+E0001>, <U+E0072>, <U+E0075>; and <fr-ca> is a
   language tag consisting of 6 Unicode characters: <U+E0001>,
   <U+E0066>, <U+E0072>, <U+E002D>, <U+E0063>, <U+E0061>.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Formal Syntax</h2></a>

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501] or [IMAPABNF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   capability            =/ "FILTERS"

   search-criteria       =  search-key *(SP search-key)

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   General issues relevant to [RFC3501] (in particular to the SEARCH
   command) and METADATA-SERVER extension [METADATA] are also relevant
   to this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that excessive use of filters can potentially simplify denial-
   of-service attacks, especially if combined with poor implementations
   and lack of loop detection (i.e., detection of filters referencing
   each other to create a loop).  Servers that allow for anonymous
   access SHOULD NOT allow anonymous users to create/edit/delete
   filters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also note that stored filters can potentially disclose personal
   information about users.  When confidentiality of such information is
   important, clients MUST use TLS and/or SASL security layer (or
   similar) as recommended in [RFC3501].  Also, clients should use
   private filters instead of public, unless they desire to share such
   information with other users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As always, it is important to thoroughly test clients and servers
   when implementing this extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IESG-approved Experimental RFC.  The IMAP4 capabilities registry is
