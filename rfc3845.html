   The DNS [6][7] NSEC [5] Resource Record (RR) is used for
   authenticated proof of the non-existence of DNS owner names and
   types.  The NSEC RR is based on the NXT RR as described in RFC 2535
   [2], and is similar except for the name and typecode.  The RDATA
   format for the NXT RR has the limitation in that the RDATA could only
   carry information about the existence of the first 127 types.  RFC
   2535 did reserve a bit to specify an extension mechanism, but the
   mechanism was never actually defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to avoid needing to develop an extension mechanism into a
   deployed base of DNSSEC aware servers and resolvers once the first
   127 type codes are allocated, this document redefines the wire format
   of the "Type Bit Map" field in the NSEC RDATA to cover the full RR
   type space.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document introduces a new format for the type bit map.  The
   properties of the type bit map format are that it can cover the full
   possible range of typecodes, that it is relatively economical in the
   amount of space it uses for the common case of a few types with an
   owner name, that it can represent owner names with all possible types
   present in packets of approximately 8.5 kilobytes, and that the
   representation is simple to implement.  Efficient searching of the
   type bitmap for the presence of certain types is not a requirement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For convenience and completeness, this document presents the syntax
   and semantics for the NSEC RR based on the specification in RFC 2535
   [2] and as updated by RFC 3755 [5], thereby not introducing changes
   except for the syntax of the type bit map.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document updates RFC 2535 [2] and RFC 3755 [5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The NSEC Resource Record</h2></a>

   The NSEC resource record lists two separate things: the owner name of
   the next RRset in the canonical ordering of the zone, and the set of
   RR types present at the NSEC RR's owner name.  The complete set of
   NSEC RRs in a zone indicate which RRsets exist in a zone, and form a
   chain of owner names in the zone.  This information is used to
   provide authenticated denial of existence for DNS data, as described
   in RFC 2535 [2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The type value for the NSEC RR is 47.
   The NSEC RR RDATA format is class independent and defined for all
   classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching [8].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   NSEC RDATA Wire Format</h3></a>

   The RDATA of the NSEC RR is as shown below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                         1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

    /                      Next Domain Name                         /

	<a name="section-2.1.1"><h4>2.1.1   The Next Domain Name Field</h4></a>

   The Next Domain Name field contains the owner name of the next RR in
   the canonical ordering of the zone.  The value of the Next Domain
   Name field in the last NSEC record in the zone is the name of the
   zone apex (the owner name of the zone's SOA RR).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A sender MUST NOT use DNS name compression on the Next Domain Name
   field when transmitting an NSEC RR.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Owner names of RRsets that are not authoritative for the given zone
   (such as glue records) MUST NOT be listed in the Next Domain Name
   unless at least one authoritative RRset exists at the same owner
   name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.2"><h4>2.1.2   The List of Type Bit Map(s) Field</h4></a>

   The RR type space is split into 256 window blocks, each representing
   the low-order 8 bits of the 16-bit RR type space.  Each block that
   has at least one active RR type is encoded using a single octet
   window number (from 0 to 255), a single octet bitmap length (from 1
   to 32) indicating the number of octets used for the window block's
   bitmap, and up to 32 octets (256 bits) of bitmap.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Window blocks are present in the NSEC RR RDATA in increasing
   numerical order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "|" denotes concatenation

   Type Bit Map(s) Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length | Bitmap ) +
   Each bitmap encodes the low-order 8 bits of RR types within the
   window block, in network bit order.  The first bit is bit 0.  For
   window block 0, bit 1 corresponds to RR type 1 (A), bit 2 corresponds
   to RR type 2 (NS), and so forth.  For window block 1, bit 1
   corresponds to RR type 257, and bit 2 to RR type 258.  If a bit is
   set to 1, it indicates that an RRset of that type is present for the
   NSEC RR's owner name.  If a bit is set to 0, it indicates that no
   RRset of that type is present for the NSEC RR's owner name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since bit 0 in window block 0 refers to the non-existing RR type 0,
   it MUST be set to 0.  After verification, the validator MUST ignore
   the value of bit 0 in window block 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bits representing Meta-TYPEs or QTYPEs, as specified in RFC 2929 [3]
   (section 3.1), or within the range reserved for assignment only to
   QTYPEs and Meta-TYPEs MUST be set to 0, since they do not appear in
   zone data.  If encountered, they must be ignored upon reading.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included.  Trailing zero
   octets in the bitmap MUST be omitted.  The length of each block's
   bitmap is determined by the type code with the largest numerical
   value within that block, among the set of RR types present at the
   NSEC RR's owner name.  Trailing zero octets not specified MUST be
   interpreted as zero octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.3"><h4>2.1.3   Inclusion of Wildcard Names in NSEC RDATA</h4></a>

   If a wildcard owner name appears in a zone, the wildcard label ("*")
   is treated as a literal symbol and is treated the same as any other
   owner name for purposes of generating NSEC RRs.  Wildcard owner names
   appear in the Next Domain Name field without any wildcard expansion.
   RFC 2535 [2] describes the impact of wildcards on authenticated
   denial of existence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   The NSEC RR Presentation Format</h3></a>

   The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Next Domain Name field is represented as a domain name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The List of Type Bit Map(s) Field is represented as a sequence of RR
   type mnemonics.  When the mnemonic is not known, the TYPE
   representation as described in RFC 3597 [4] (section 5) MUST be used.
	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   NSEC RR Example</h3></a>

   The following NSEC RR identifies the RRsets associated with
   alfa.example.com. and the next authoritative name after
   alfa.example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   alfa.example.com. 86400 IN NSEC host.example.com. A MX RRSIG NSEC
   TYPE1234

   The first four text fields specify the name, TTL, Class, and RR type
   (NSEC).  The entry host.example.com. is the next authoritative name
   after alfa.example.com. in canonical order.  The A, MX, RRSIG, NSEC,
   and TYPE1234 mnemonics indicate there are A, MX, RRSIG, NSEC, and
   TYPE1234 RRsets associated with the name alfa.example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RDATA section of the NSEC RR above would be encoded as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      0x04 'h'  'o'  's'  't'
      0x07 'e'  'x'  'a'  'm'  'p'  'l'  'e'
      0x03 'c'  'o'  'm'  0x00
      0x00 0x06 0x40 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x03
      0x04 0x1b 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
      0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
      0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
      0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x20

   Assuming that the resolver can authenticate this NSEC record, it
   could be used to prove that beta.example.com does not exist, or could
   be used to prove that there is no AAAA record associated with
   alfa.example.com.  Authenticated denial of existence is discussed in
   RFC 2535 [2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document introduces no new IANA considerations, because all of
   the protocol parameters used in this document have already been
   assigned by RFC 3755 [5].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The update of the RDATA format and encoding does not affect the
   security of the use of NSEC RRs.
