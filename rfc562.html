Request for Comments: 562                                      BBN-TENEX
NIC: 18638                                                28 August 1973
Updates: RFC 495

               Modifications to the TELNET Specification

   Almost four months have passed since the new TELNET Protocol
   specification was published.  Since then, only two RFCs have been
   issued suggesting modifications, and the most recent of these was
   distributed two months ago.  Further, the date from the old TELNET to
   the new TELNET (1 January 1974) is only four months away.  It
   therefore seems appropriate to officially modify the specification to
   account for the suggested modifications, and to declare a moratorium
   on the incorporation of additional suggestions until after the
   switchover. (Of course, no moratorium on the specification of
   additional options is required.)

   The two attached documents represent the revised TELNET Protocol
   specifications; they replace NIC #15372, TELNET Protocol
   Specification, and NIC #15373, TELNET Option Specifications.  The
   remainder of this RFC summarizes the changes.  Page numbers refer to
   the earlier documents.
