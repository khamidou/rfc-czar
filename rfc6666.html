                       A Discard Prefix for IPv6

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   Remote triggered black hole filtering describes a method of
   mitigating the effects of denial-of-service attacks by selectively
   discarding traffic based on source or destination address.  Remote
   triggered black hole routing describes a method of selectively re-
   routing traffic into a sinkhole router (for further analysis) based
   on destination address.  This document updates the "IPv6 Special
   Purpose Address Registry" by explaining why a unique IPv6 prefix
   should be formally assigned by IANA for the purpose of facilitating
   IPv6 remote triggered black hole filtering and routing.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering describes a class of
   methods of blocking IP traffic either from a specific source
   ([RFC5635]) or to a specific destination ([RFC3882]) on a network.
   RTBH routing describes a class of methods of re-routing IP traffic
   destined to the attacked/targeted host to a special path (tunnel)
   where a sniffer could capture the traffic for analysis.  Both of
   these methods operate by setting the next-hop address of an IP packet
   with a specified source or destination address to be a unicast prefix
   that is connected locally or remotely to a router's discard, null, or
   tunnel interface.  Typically, reachability information for this
   prefix is propagated throughout an autonomous system using a dynamic
   routing protocol such as BGP ([RFC3882]).  By deploying RTBH systems
   across a network, traffic to or from specific destinations may be
   selectively black-holed or re-routed to a sinkhole device in a manner
   that is efficient, scalable, and straightforward to implement.
   On some networks, operators configure RTBH installations using
   [RFC1918] address space or the address blocks reserved for
   documentation in [RFC5737].  This approach is inadequate because RTBH
   configurations are not documentation, but rather operationally
   important features of many public-facing production networks.
   Furthermore, [RFC3849] specifies that the IPv6 documentation prefix
   should be filtered in both local and public contexts.  On this basis,
   it is suggested that both private network address blocks and the
   documentation prefixes described in [RFC5737] are inappropriate for
   RTBH configurations and that a dedicated IPv6 prefix should be
   assigned instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document updates the "IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry"
   [IANA-IPV6REG].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Notational Conventions</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   A Discard Prefix for IPv6</h2></a>

   For the purposes of implementing an IPv6 RTBH configuration, a
   unicast address block is required.  There are currently no IPv6
   unicast address blocks that are specifically nominated for the
   purposes of implementing such RTBH systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While it could be argued that there are other addresses and address
   prefixes that could be used for this purpose (e.g., documentation
   prefixes, private address space), or that an operator could assign an
   address block from their own address space for this purpose, there is
   currently no operational clarity on what address block would be
   appropriate or inappropriate to use for this purpose.  By assigning a
   globally unique discard prefix for IPv6, the IETF will introduce good
   practice for the implementation of IPv6 RTBH configurations and will
   facilitate operational clarity by allowing operators to implement
   consistent and deterministic inter-domain prefix and traffic
   filtering policies for black-holed traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As [RFC3882] and [RFC5635] describe situations where more than one
   discard address may be used for implementing multiple RTBH scenarios,
   a single address is not sufficient to cover all likely RTBH
   situations.  Consequently, an address block is required.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Operational Implications</h2></a>

   This assignment MAY be carried in a dynamic routing protocol within
   an autonomous system.  The assignment SHOULD NOT be announced to or
   accepted from third-party autonomous systems, and IPv6 traffic with a
   destination address within this prefix SHOULD NOT be forwarded to or
   accepted from third-party autonomous systems.  If the prefix or a
   subnet of the prefix is inadvertently announced to or accepted from a
   third-party autonomous system, this may cause excessive volumes of
   traffic to pass unintentionally between the two networks, which would
   aggravate the effect of a denial-of-service attack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On networks that implement IPv6 remote triggered black holes, some or
   all of this network block MAY be configured with a next-hop
   destination of a discard or null interface on any or all IPv6 routers
   within the autonomous system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   Per this document, IANA has recorded the allocation of the IPv6
   address prefix 0100::/64 as a Discard-Only Prefix in the "Internet
   Protocol Version 6 Address Space" and added the prefix to the "IANA
   IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry" [IANA-IPV6REG].  No end party
   has been assigned to this prefix.  The prefix has been allocated from
   ::/3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   As the prefix specified in this document ought not normally be
   transmitted or accepted over inter-domain BGP sessions for the
   reasons described in Section 3, it is usually appropriate to include
   this prefix in inter-domain BGP prefix filters [RFC3704] or otherwise
   ensure the prefix is neither transmitted to nor accepted from a
   third-party autonomous system.
