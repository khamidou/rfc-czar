       Raptor Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes for FECFRAME

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) Schemes for the Raptor and RaptorQ codes and their application
   to reliable delivery of media streams in the context of the FEC
   Framework.  The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are systematic codes, where
   a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols
   and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source
   symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The
   Raptor and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against
   arbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC
   Schemes are defined: two for the protection of arbitrary packet
   flows, two that are optimized for small source blocks, and two for
   the protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence
   number.  Repair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport
   (e.g., UDP) or using RTP.

   The "Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework" [RFC6363] describes a
   general framework for the use of Forward Error Correction in
   association with arbitrary packet flows.  Modeled after the FEC
   Building Block developed by the IETF Reliable Multicast Transport
   working group [RFC5052], the FEC Framework defines the concept of FEC
   Schemes that provide specific Forward Error Correction Schemes.  This
   document describes six FEC Schemes that make use of the Raptor and
   RaptorQ FEC codes as defined in [RFC5053] and [RFC6330].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The FEC protection mechanism is independent of the type of source
   data that can be an arbitrary sequence of packets, for example audio
   or video data.  In general, the operation of the protection mechanism
   is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sender determines a set of source packets (a source block) to
      be protected together based on the FEC Framework Configuration
      Information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sender arranges the source packets into a set of source
      symbols, each of which is the same size.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sender applies the Raptor/RaptorQ protection operation on the
      source symbols to generate the required number of repair symbols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sender packetizes the repair symbols and sends the repair
      packet(s) and the source packets to the receiver(s).  Per the FEC
      Framework requirements, the sender MUST transmit the source and
      repair packets in different source and repair flows, or in the
      case Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) transport is used for
      repair packets, in different RTP streams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  At the receiver side, if all of the source packets are
      successfully received, there is no need for FEC recovery and the
      repair packets are discarded.  However, if there are missing
      source packets, the repair packets can be used to recover the
      missing information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The operation of the FEC mechanism requires that the receiver is able
   to identify the relationships between received source packets and
   repair packets, in particular, which source packets are missing.  In
   many cases, data already exists in the source packets that can be
   used to refer to source packets and to identify which packets are
   missing.  In this case, we assume it is possible to derive a
   "sequence number" directly or indirectly from the source packets, and
   this sequence number can be used within the FEC Scheme.  This case is
   referred to as a "single sequenced flow".  In this case, the FEC
   Source Payload ID defined in [RFC6363] is empty and the source
   packets are not modified by the application of FEC, with obvious
   backwards compatibility advantages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Otherwise, it is necessary to add data to the source packets for FEC
   purposes in the form of a non-empty FEC Source Payload ID.  This is
   referred to as the "arbitrary packet flow" case.  This document
   defines six FEC Schemes, two for the case of a single sequenced flow
   and four for the case of arbitrary packet flows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Document Outline</h2></a>

   This document is organized as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 5 defines general procedures applicable to the use of the
      Raptor and RaptorQ codes in the context of the FEC Framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 6 defines a FEC Scheme for the case of arbitrary source
      flows and follows the format defined for FEC Schemes in [RFC6363].
      When used with Raptor codes, this scheme is equivalent to that
      defined in 3GPP TS 26.346, "Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
      (MBMS); Protocols and codecs" [MBMSTS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 7 defines a FEC Scheme similar to that defined in Section
      6 but with optimizations for the case where only limited source
      block sizes are required.  When used with Raptor codes, this
      scheme is equivalent to that defined in ETSI TS 102.034, "Digital
      Video Broadcasting (DVB); Transport of MPEG-2 Based DVB Services
      over IP Based Networks" [DVBTS] for arbitrary packet flows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 8 defines a FEC Scheme for the case of a single flow,
      which is already provided with a source packet sequence number.
      When used with Raptor codes, this scheme is equivalent to that
      defined in [DVBTS] for the case of a single sequenced flow.

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Definitions</h3></a>

   The FEC-specific terminology used in this document is defined in
   [RFC6363].  In this document, as in [RFC6363], the first letter of
   each FEC-specific term is capitalized along with the new terms
   defined here:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Symbol:  A unit of data.  Its size, in octets, is referred to as the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ADU:  Application Data Unit

   ADUI:  Application Data Unit Information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SPI:  Source Packet Information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MSBL:  Maximum Source Block Length

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   General Procedures for Raptor FEC Schemes</h2></a>

   This section specifies general procedures that apply to all Raptor
   and RaptorQ FEC Schemes, specifically the construction of source
   symbols from a set of source transport payloads.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For any field defined in this document, the octets are ordered in
   network byte order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As described in [RFC6363], for each Application Data Unit (ADU) in a
   source block, the FEC Scheme is provided with:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A description of the source data flow with which the ADU is
      associated and an integer identifier associated with that flow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The ADU itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The length of the ADU.
   For each ADU, we define the Application Data Unit Information (ADUI)
   as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Let

   o  n be the number of ADUs in the source block.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  T be the source symbol size in octets.  Note: this information is
      provided by the FEC Scheme as defined below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  i the index to the (i+1)-th ADU to be added to the source block,
      0 <= i < n.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  f[i] denote the integer identifier associated with the source data
      flow from which the i-th ADU was taken.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  F[i] denote a single octet representing the value of f[i].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  l[i] be a length indication associated with the i-th ADU -- the
      nature of the length indication is defined by the FEC Scheme.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  L[i] denote two octets representing the value of l[i] in network
      byte order (high order octet first) of the i-th ADU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  R[i] denote the number of octets in the (i+1)-th ADU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  s[i] be the smallest integer such that s[i]*T >= (l[i]+3).  Note:
      s[i] is the length of SPI[i] in units of symbols of size T octets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  P[i] denote s[i]*T-(l[i]+3) zero octets.  Note: P[i] are padding
      octets to align the start of each UDP packet with the start of a
      symbol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  ADUI[i] be the concatenation of F[i], L[i], R[i], and P[i].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Then, a source data block is constructed by concatenating ADUI[i] for
   i = 0, 1, 2, ... n-1.  The source data block size, S, is then given
   by sum {s[i]*T, i=0, ..., n-1}.  Symbols are allocated integer
   encoding symbol IDs (ESI) consecutively starting from zero within the
   source block.  Each ADU is associated with the ESI of the first
   symbol containing SPI for that packet.  Thus, the encoding symbol ID
   value associated with the j-th source packet, ESI[j], is given by
   ESI[j] = 0, for j=0 and ESI[j] = sum{s[i], i=0,...,(j-1)}, for
   0 < j < n.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Source blocks are identified by integer Source Block Numbers.  This
   specification does not specify how Source Block Numbers are allocated
   to the source blocks.  The Source FEC Packet Identification
   Information consists of the identity of the source block and the
   encoding symbol ID associated with the packet.

   This section specifies a slightly modified version of the FEC Scheme
   specified in Section 6 that is applicable to scenarios in which only

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In outline, the modifications are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  All source blocks within a stream are encoded using the same
      source block size.  Code shortening is used to encode blocks of
      different sizes.  This is achieved by padding every block to the
      required size using zero symbols before encoding.  The zero
      symbols are then discarded after decoding.  The source block size
      to be used for a stream is signaled in the Maximum Source Block
      Length (MSBL) field of the scheme-specific information.  The
      extended source block is constructed by adding zero or more
      padding symbols such that the total number of symbols, MSBL, is
      one of the values listed in Section 7.4.  Each padding symbol
      consists of T octets where the value of each octet is zero.  MSBL
      MUST be selected as the smallest value of the possible values in

   The Source FEC Packet Identification Information for a source packet
   is derived from the sequence number of the packet and information
   received in any repair FEC packet belonging to this source block.
   Source blocks are identified by the sequence number of the first
   source packet in the block.  This information is signaled in all
   repair FEC packets associated with the source block in the Initial
   Sequence Number field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The length of the Source Packet Information (in octets) for source
   packets within a source block is equal to the length of the payload
   containing encoding symbols of the repair packets (i.e., not
   including the Repair FEC Payload ID) for that block, which MUST be
   the same for all repair packets.  The Application Data Unit
   Information Length (ADUIL) in symbols is equal to this length divided
   by the encoding symbol size (which is signaled in the FEC Framework
   Configuration Information).  The set of source packets included in
   the source block is determined by the Initial Sequence Number (ISN)
   and Source Block Length (SBL) as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Let,

   o  I be the Initial Sequence Number of the source block

   o  LP be the Source Packet Information Length in symbols

   o  LB be the Source Block Length in symbols

   Then, source packets with sequence numbers from I to I +(LB/LP)-1
   inclusive are included in the source block.  The Source Block Length,
   LB, MUST be chosen such that it is at least as large as the largest
   Source Packet Information Length LP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that if no FEC repair packets are received, then no FEC decoding
   is possible, and it is unnecessary for the receiver to identify the
   Source FEC Packet Identification Information for the source packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding symbol ID for a packet is derived from the following
   information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The sequence number, Ns, of the packet

   o  The Source Packet Information Length for the source block, LP
   o  The Initial Sequence Number of the source block, I

   Then, the encoding symbol ID for the packet with sequence number Ns
   is determined by the following formula:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ESI = ( Ns - I ) * LP

   Note that all repair packets associated to a given source block MUST
   contain the same Source Block Length and Initial Sequence Number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note also that the source packet flow processed by the FEC encoder
   MUST have consecutive sequence numbers.  In case the incoming source
   packet flow has a gap in the sequence numbers, then implementors
