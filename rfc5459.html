	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation
   G.729.1 [ITU-G.729.1] is a scalable and wideband extension of the
   Recommendation G.729 [ITU-G.729] audio codec.  [RFC4749] specifies
   the payload format for packetization of G.729.1-encoded audio signals
   into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Annex C of G.729.1 [ITU-G.729.1-C] adds Discontinuous Transmission
   (DTX) support to G.729.1.  This document updates the RTP payload
   format to allow usage of this Annex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Only changes or additions to [RFC4749] will be described in the
   following sections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Background</h2></a>

   G.729.1 supports Discontinuous Transmission (DTX), a.k.a. "silence
   suppression".  It means that the coder includes a Voice Activity
   Detection (VAD) algorithm to determine if an audio frame contains
   silence or actual audio.  During silence periods, the coder may
   significantly decrease the transmitted bit rate by sending a small
   frame called a Silence Insertion Descriptor (SID) and then stop
   transmission.  The receiver's decoder will generate comfort noise
   (CNG) according to the parameters contained in the SID.  This DTX/CNG
   scheme is specified in [ITU-G.729.1-C].
   The G.729.1 SID has an embedded structure.  The core SID is the same
   as the legacy G.729 SID [ITU-G.729-B].  The first enhancement layer
   adds some parameters for narrowband comfort noise, while a second
   enhancement layer adds wideband information.  The G.729.1 SID can be
   2, 3, or 6 octets long.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   RTP Header Usage</h2></a>

   The fields of the RTP header must be used as described in [RFC4749],
   except for the Marker (M) bit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If DTX is used, the first packet of a talkspurt -- that is, the first
   packet after a silence period during which packets have not been
   transmitted contiguously -- MUST be distinguished by setting the M
   bit in the RTP data header to 1.  The M bit in all other packets MUST
   be set to 0.  The beginning of a talkspurt MAY be used to adjust the
   playout delay to reflect changing network delays.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If DTX is not used, the M bit MUST be set to 0 in all packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Payload Format</h2></a>

   The payload format is the same as in [RFC4749], with the option to
   add a SID at the end.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   So the complete payload consists of a payload header of 1 octet (MBS
   (maximum bit rate supported) and FT (frame type) fields), followed by
   zero or more consecutive audio frames at the same bit rate, followed
   by zero or one SID.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that this is consistent with the payload format of G.729
      described in section 4.5.6 of [RFC3551].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To be able to transport a SID alone -- that is, without actual audio
   frames -- we assign the FT value 14 to the SID.  When using FT=14,
   only a single SID frame SHALL be included in the payload.  The actual
   SID size (2, 3, or 6 octets) is inferred from the payload size: it is
   the size of what is left after the payload header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a SID is appended to actual audio frames, the FT value remains
   the one describing the encoding rate of the audio frames.  Since the
   SID is much smaller than any other frame, it can be easily detected
   at the receiver side, and it will not hinder the calculation of the
   number of frames.  The actual SID size is inferred from the payload
   size: it is the size of what is left after the audio frames.
   Section 5.4 of [RFC4749] mandates to ignore the remaining bytes after
   complete frames.  This document overrides that statement: the
   receiver of the payload must consider these remaining bytes as a SID
   frame.  If the size of this remainder is not a valid SID frame size
   (2, 3, or 6 octets), the receiver MUST ignore these bytes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The full FT table is given for convenience:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><pre>               +-------+---------------+-------------------+
               |   FT  | encoding rate |     frame size    |
               +-------+---------------+-------------------+
               |   0   |     8 kbps    |     20 octets     |
               |   1   |    12 kbps    |     30 octets     |
               |   2   |    14 kbps    |     35 octets     |
               |   3   |    16 kbps    |     40 octets     |

   DTX has no impact on the MBS definition and use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Payload Format Parameters</h2></a>

   Parameters defined in [RFC4749] are not modified.  We add a new
   optional parameter to configure DTX.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Media Type Registration Update</h3></a>

   We add a new optional parameter to the audio/G7291 media subtype:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   dtx: indicates that Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) is used or
      preferred.  Permissible values are 0 and 1. 0 means no DTX. 1
      means DTX support, as described in Annex C of ITU-T Recommendation
      G.729.1. 0 is implied if this parameter is omitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When DTX is turned off, the RTP payload MUST NOT contain a SID, and
   the FT value 14 MUST NOT be used.
	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Mapping to SDP Parameters</h3></a>

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mapping described in [RFC4749] remains unchanged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "dtx" parameter goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some example partial SDP session descriptions utilizing G.729.1
   encodings follow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example 1: default parameters (DTX off)

      m=audio 57586 RTP/AVP 96
      a=rtpmap:96 G7291/16000

   Example 2: recommended packet duration of 40 ms (=2 frames), maximum
   bit rate is 20 kbps, DTX supported and preferred.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      m=audio 49987 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 G7291/16000
      a=fmtp:97 maxbitrate=20000; dtx=1
      a=ptime:40

	<a name="section-5.2.1"><h4>5.2.1   DTX Offer-Answer Model Considerations</h4></a>

   The offer-answer model considerations of [RFC4749] fully apply.  In
   this section, we only define the management of the "dtx" parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "dtx" parameter concerns both sending and receiving, so both
   sides of a bi-directional session MUST have the same DTX setting.  If
   one party indicates that it does not support DTX, DTX must be
   deactivated both ways.  In other words, DTX is actually activated if,
   and only if, "dtx=1" in the offer and in the answer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A special rule applies for multicast: the "dtx" parameter becomes
   declarative and MUST NOT be negotiated.  This parameter is fixed, and
   a participant MUST use the configuration that is provided for the
   session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An RTP receiver compliant with only RFC 4749 and not this
   specification will ignore the "dtx" parameter and will not include it
   in its answer, so DTX will not be activated in this case.  As a
   remark, if that happened, this kind of receiver would not be confused
   by an RTP stream with DTX because RFC 4749 requires that the bytes
   that are now used for SID frames be ignored.  But during the silence
   period, the receiver would then react using packet loss concealment
   instead of comfort noise generation, leading to bad audio quality.
   This justifies the use of the "dtx" parameter, even if the payload
   format is backward-compatible at the binary level.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.2"><h4>5.2.2   DTX Declarative SDP Considerations</h4></a>

   The "dtx" parameter is declarative and provides the parameter that
   SHALL be used when receiving and/or sending the configured stream.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Congestion Control</h2></a>

   The congestion control considerations of [RFC4749] apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of DTX can help congestion control by reducing the number of
   transmitted RTP packets and the average bandwidth of audio streams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The security considerations of [RFC4749] apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   By observing the RTP flow with DTX, an attacker could see when and
   for how long people are speaking.  This is a general fact for DTX,
   and G.729.1 DTX introduces no new specific issue.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has assigned a new optional parameter for media subtype (audio/
   G7291); see Section 5.1.
