	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   RFC 4279 specifies cipher suites for supporting TLS using pre-shared
   symmetric keys that (a) use only symmetric key operations for
   authentication, (b) use a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with
   a pre-shared key (PSK), or (c) combine public key authentication of
   the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 4785 specifies authentication-only cipher suites (with no
   encryption).  These cipher suites are useful when authentication and
   integrity protection is desired, but confidentiality is not needed or
   not permitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 4492 defines a set of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based
   cipher suites for TLS and describes the use of ECC certificates for
   client authentication.  In particular, it specifies the use of
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in a TLS handshake
   and the use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
   as a new authentication mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies a set of cipher suites that use a PSK to
   authenticate an ECDH exchange.  These cipher suites provide Perfect
   Forward Secrecy.  Some of these cipher suites provide authentication
   only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The reader is expected to become familiar with RFC 4279, RFC 4492,
   and RFC 4785 prior to studying this document.
	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Applicability Statement</h3></a>

   The cipher suites defined in this document can be negotiated,
   whatever the negotiated TLS version is.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The applicability statement in [RFC4279] applies to this document as
   well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Conventions Used in This Document</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   ECDHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm</h2></a>

   The cipher suites described in this document make use of the elliptic
   curve (EC) parameter negotiation mechanism defined in RFC 4492.  When
   the cipher suites defined in this document are used, the
   'ec_diffie_hellman_psk' case inside the ServerKeyExchange and
   ClientKeyExchange structure MUST be used instead of the 'psk' case
   defined in [RFC4279] (i.e., the ServerKeyExchange and
   ClientKeyExchange messages include the EC Diffie-Hellman parameters
   in the form specified in Sections 5.4 and 5.7 of [RFC4492]).  The PSK
   identity and identity hint fields have the same meaning and encoding
   as specified in [RFC4279] (note that the ServerKeyExchange message is
   always sent, even if no PSK identity hint is provided).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages is
   shown below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case ec_diffie_hellman_psk:  /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity_hint<0..2^16-1>;
                  ServerECDHParams params;
          };
      } ServerKeyExchange;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case ec_diffie_hellman_psk:   /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity<0..2^16-1>;
                  ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic public;
          } exchange_keys;
      } ClientKeyExchange;
   The premaster secret is formed as follows.  First, perform the ECDH
   computation as described in Section 5.10 of [RFC4492].  Let Z be the
   octet string produced by this computation.  Next, concatenate a
   uint16 containing the length of Z (in octets), Z itself, a uint16
   containing the length of the PSK (in octets), and the PSK itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This corresponds to the general structure for the premaster secrets
   (see Note 1 in Section 2 of [RFC4279]), with "other_secret"
   containing Z.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      struct {
          opaque other_secret<0..2^16-1>;
          opaque psk<0..2^16-1>;
      };

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   ECDHE_PSK-Based Cipher Suites</h2></a>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above four cipher suites match the cipher suites defined in
   [RFC4279], except that they use an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   exchange [RFC4492] authenticated with a PSK, and:

      Random Function (PRF) from that version is used; otherwise, the

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xC0,0x38};

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above two cipher suites are the same as the corresponding

   follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  For the cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384:

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suite Using the SHA-1 Hash with NULL Encryption</h3></a>

   The following cipher suite matches the cipher suites defined in

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC5246],
   [RFC4785], [RFC4492], and [RFC4279] apply here as well.  In
   particular, as the authentication-only cipher suites (with no
   encryption) defined here do not support confidentiality, care should
   be taken not to send sensitive information (such as passwords) over
   connections protected with one of the cipher suites with NULL
   encryption defined in Section 4 of this document.
   Implementers and administrators should monitor the general statements
   on recommended cryptographic algorithms (e.g., SHA-1 hash function)
   that are published from time to time by various forums, including the
   IETF, as a base for the portfolio they support and the policies for
   strength of function acceptable for the cipher suites they set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document defines the following new cipher suites, whose values
   have been assigned from the TLS Cipher Suite registry defined in
   [RFC5246].
