   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for
   managing the Line Code Specific parameters of Very High Speed Digital
   Subscriber Line (VDSL) interfaces using Multiple Carrier Modulation
   (MCM) Line Coding.  It is an optional extension to the VDSL-LINE-MIB,
   RFC 3728, which handles line code independent objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overview</h2></a>

   This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing the Line Code
   Dependent, Physical Medium Dependent (PMD), Layer of MCM VDSL Lines.
   These definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as
   defined in T1E1, European Telecommunications Standards Institute
   (ETSI), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) documentation
   [T1E1311, T1E1011, T1E1013, ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971].
   Additionally the protocol-dependent (and line-code dependent)
   management framework for VDSL lines specified by the Digital
   Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration
   [DSLFTR57].
   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB-2 transmission.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Relationship of this MIB Module to other MIB Modules</h3></a>

   The relationship of the VDSL Line MIB module to other MIB modules and
   in particular to the IF-MIB, as presented in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is
   discussed in the VDSL-LINE-MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].  This section
   outlines the relationship of this VDSL Line Extension MIB to the
   VDSL-LINE-MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].

	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Structure</h3></a>

   The MCM VDSL Line Extension MIB contains the following MIB group:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   vdslMCMGroup :

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This group supports MIB objects for defining configuration profiles
   and for monitoring individual bands of Multiple Carrier Modulation
   (MCM) VDSL modems.  It contains the following tables:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable

   If the MCM VDSL Line Extension MIB is implemented then all of the
   objects in this group MUST be implemented.
   Figure 1, below, displays the relationship of the tables in the
   vdslMCMGroup to the vdslGroup and to the ifEntry:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ifEntry(ifType=97)  ----> vdslLineTableEntry 1:(0..1)

      vdslLineTableEntry (vdslLineCoding=MCM)

      vdslLineConfProfileEntry(vdslLineConfProfileName)
                 ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileTable 1:(0..1)
                 ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable 1:(0..n)
                 ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandTable 1:(0..n)
                 ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTable 1:(0..n)
                 ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTable 1:(0..n)
                 ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable 1:(0..n)

                       Figure 1: Table Relationships

   When the object vdslLineCoding is set to MCM, vdslLineConfProfileName
   is used as the index to each of the six vdslLineMCMConfProfile
   Tables.  The existence of an entry in any of the tables of the
   vdslMCMGroup is optional.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Persistence</h3></a>

   All read-create objects defined in this MIB module SHOULD be stored
   persistently.  Following is an exhaustive list of these persistent
   objects:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        vdslMCMConfProfileTxWindowLength
        vdslMCMConfProfileRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandNumber
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandStart
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandStop
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileRxBandStart
        vdslMCMConfProfileRxBandStop
        vdslMCMConfProfileRxBandRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxPSDTone
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxPSDPSD

        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTone
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDPSD
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDRowStatus
   Note also that the interface indices in this MIB are maintained
   persistently.  View-based Access Control Model (VACM) data relating
   to these SHOULD be stored persistently as well [RFC3415].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Conformance and Compliance</h2></a>

   An MCM based VDSL agent does not have to implement this MIB to be
   compliant with RFC 3728 [RFC3728].  If the MCM VDSL Line Extension
   MIB is implemented then the following group is mandatory:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  vdslMCMGroup

   DESCRIPTION
       "The VDSL-LINE-MIB found in RFC 3728 defines objects for
       the management of a pair of VDSL transceivers at each end of
       the VDSL line.  The VDSL-LINE-MIB configures and monitors the
       line code independent parameters (TC layer) of the VDSL line.
       This MIB module is an optional extension of the VDSL-LINE-MIB
       and defines objects for configuration and monitoring of the
       line code specific (LCS) elements (PMD layer) for VDSL lines
       using MCM coding.  The objects in this extension MIB MUST NOT
       be used for VDSL lines using Single Carrier Modulation (SCM)
       line coding.  If an object in this extension MIB is referenced
       by a line which does not use MCM, it has no effect on the
       operation of that line.

   VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber to
   manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded
   operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.  For example, unchecked
   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate
   sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the
   management interface to the network or the element manager.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additionally, allowing write access to configuration data may allow
   an end-user to increase their service levels or affect other end-
   users in either a positive or negative manner.  For this reason, the
   tables and objects listed above should be considered to contain
   sensitive information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Read access of the physical band parameters may provide knowledge to
   an end-user that would allow malicious behavior, for example the
   application of an intentional interference on one or all of the
   physical bands in use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of a MIB module which utilizes the textual conventions
   defined in this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
