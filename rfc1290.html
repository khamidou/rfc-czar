	<a name="section-1.0"><h3>1.0   Introduction</h3></a>

   This paper is a list of the essential things, in my view, that a
   person who is responsible for providing network information should
   have in their hands as reference material.  One of the basic problems
   of information is making it easily available to those who have need
   of the data.  Libraries have been performing a cataloging function
   for many centuries.  Information flow is now being provided at such a
   fast rate that it is difficult to keep up with it, even partially.
   Computer networks have only added to the problem by opening up even
   more information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Attempting to make this wealth of information available to those who
   would find it useful poses some problems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   First, we need to know of its existence.  To that end, this paper
   provides an index into the vast realm of network information. Most of
   the documents listed here are POINTERS to the final information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Second, even if you know of a document's existence, you may not know
   if it is important or relevant.  Few of us are knowledgeable in more
   than a limited area.  We need to rely on others to make us aware of
   the importance of databases in a specific discipline. The librarians
   can be of great assistance here.  They are familiar with the research
   databases that individuals search in Law, Mathematics, and many
   others.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, once the existence and importance are known, the information
   needs to be indexed so that researchers can find it.  This is the
   most difficult task to accomplish.  Information available on the
   network is hardly ever static.  It is always moving, growing,
   changing, and dying.  Computers should be able to assist us in
   managing this ever-changing environment.  Right now, we have to
   catalog the information as it passes through the network.  In my
   case, I generally save it in a file somewhere, spending far too much
   time trying to retrieve it again when needed.

   2.05  Regional Network Policies (Documents)

      Many regional networks have developed policies on responsible use
      of their network.  You can retrieve copies of these policies on
      line by anonymous FTP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Source:

      will give you a directory of the filenames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.06  Campus ethics/policy statements (Documents)

      Many universities have developed more complete policies based on
      the regional network policies.  If you wish to look at some to use

      anonymous FTP.

   2.07  VAX book (Document)

      Joe St Sauver of the University of Oregon has developed a very
      complete guide of information on the network available via
      anonymous FTP.  The following is a quote from the README file:
      "While it is tailored to the University of Oregon's VAX8000
      system, the skills it illustrates are general enough to be of
      interest to users at most other VAX sites, and even users at many
      non-VAX sites connected to the national networks." There is a
      major section on Network Topics that is excellent.  It is a large
      document, over 300 pages.

      Washington University represents perhaps one of the most popular
      sites for software on the network.  The mirrors directory is where
      a copy of all of the wsmr-simtel20.army.mil files are kept.
      Wsmr-simtel20-army.mil is the originator and keeper of major
      amounts of public domain software.  Their site, however, is often
      overloaded with connections and difficult to make connection to.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      You will find enough software here to keep you busy for the rest

   The information provided in this paper is primarily intended for the
   individuals who will use this information to then provide methods for
   access from their own computing environment.  Although standards have
   been proposed, there are no "packages" that give you access to all of
   the information presented here.  What we at Ohio State University
   have done, as have several other universities, is to provide a menu
   to the user that accesses these services and databases behind the
   scenes.  In fact, Ur had to go into the shell scripts to look up the
   network addresses of these machines, because I rely on the menu for
   access as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As the name "Information Systems" implies, the user wants access to
   the information without having to know exactly how to get to it.  In
   this way, the network is invisible to the end user.  All they need to
   know is what they want, not the command structure needed to actually
   get the information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At the present, the menu system seems to be the easiest way in which
   to lead the end user to the information.  A term "knowbot" has been
   used to describe the ability to indicate what information you wish in
   free form, and have a "knowbot" which knows what is available, go out
   and retrieve it.

      ability to do remote login (Telnet sessions).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   12.2  Internet:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A very large network that connects just about any type of
      computer together.  It supports e-mail, file transfer (FTP), and
      remote login (Telnet).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   12.3  Anonymous FTP:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The ability to transfer a file from a remote computer connected
      to Internet without having an account on the remote computer.
      The program that performs the file transfer is normal FTP.  To
      connect to a remote computer offering anonymous FTP you can use
      the following commands from a computer connected to Internet:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      FTP Internet computer name
      When prompted for a userid:  type anonymous
      When prompted for a password type your e-mail address
      To get a listing of files type dir
      To change directory type cd directory name
      To get a file type get filename
      To get a binary file type binary then get filename
      To end session type quit

      Example:
      FTP pilot.njin.net
      Username:  anonymous
      Password:  yourname@computer.edu
      cd pub/ftp-list
      get ftp.list
      quit
   12.4  Telnet:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The ability to establish a connection to a remote computer
      connected to the Internet network.  There are two types of
      programs that are used to do this.  One, normally referred to as
      Telnet, normally establishes a VT100 type terminal emulation to
      the remote computer.  The second, TN3270, establishes a full
      screen IBM 3270 type terminal connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   12.5  Listserv:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A program available on many BITNET connected computers that can
      act as a mail forward system and as a file repository.  BITNET is
      another network that links many colleges and universities
      together.  It does not normally link to military or government
      institutions as does the Internet.  To subscribe to a listserv,
      you normally send mail to the machine which has the mailing list
      with the command to subscribe.  As an example, to subscribe to a
      list for discussion of topics pertinent to Mechanical Engineering,
      you would send e-mail to listserv@utarlvml with the content of the
      message containing the one line command to subscribe:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SUB MECH-1 John Doe  (Where John Doe would be your full name)

      The document "Interest Groups" listed below contains the list of
      the majority of these lists that you can subscribe.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Disclaimer

   The information provided in the previous sections has been put
   together from multiple sources acquired from the network.  Much of it
   came from reading newsgroups and trying things out to see how they
   worked.  The information is as accurate as I have been able to
   determine, as of December 5, 1991.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   I used a DEC5500 system running Ultrix to check most of these
   sources.  Most of the information is oriented toward Internet, since
   it has the ability to remote login (Telnet) and File Transfer (FTP).
