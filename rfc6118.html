   Appendix A.  Former Content of the IANA Repository . . . . . . . . 49
	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   [RFC6117] has obsoleted the IANA registration section of [RFC3761].
   Since the IANA Enumservice registry contains various Enumservices
   registered under the regime of RFC 3761, those registrations do not
   conform to the new guidelines as specified in [RFC6117].  To ensure
   consistency among all Enumservice registrations at IANA, this
   document adds the (nowadays) missing elements to those legacy
   registrations.  Furthermore, all legacy Enumservice registrations are
   converted to the new XML-chunk format, and, where deemed necessary,
   minor editorial corrections are applied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, this document only adds the missing elements to the XML
   chunks as specified in the IANA Considerations section of [RFC6117],
   but it does not complete the (nowadays) missing sections of the
   corresponding Enumservice Specifications.  In order to conform with
   the new registration regime as specified in [RFC6117], those
   Enumservice Specifications still have to be revised.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is important to note that this document does not update the
   functional specification of the concerned Enumservices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following RFCs are updated by this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  [RFC3762]
   o  [RFC3764]
   o  [RFC3953]
   o  [RFC4143]
   o  [RFC4002]
   o  [RFC4238]
   o  [RFC4355]
   o  [RFC4415]
   o  [RFC4769]

	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IESG Action</h2></a>

   According to [RFC3761], any Enumservice registration had to be
   published as a Standards Track, Experimental, or BCP (Best Current
   Practice) RFC.  [RFC6117] no longer has this requirement, i.e.,
   "Specification Required", which implies the use of a Designated
   Expert [RFC5226], is sufficient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document changes the approval requirement for updates to
   Enumservice registrations to Specification Required, whereby the
   specification and request are reviewed by a Designated Expert as
   described in [RFC6117].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Legacy Enumservice Registrations Converted to XML Chunks</h2></a>

   In the following, the legacy Enumservice Registrations are converted
   to XML chunks that include the new elements introduced by [RFC6117].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (Note that references in Sections 4.1 - 4.39 refer to the references
   section within the respective Enumservice Specification.)

          The MMS Architecture describes an interface
          between the MMSE and "legacy messaging systems"
          (labelled as MM3) that accepts "standard" SMTP
          messages.  Thus, although the MMS Relay Server that
          supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP
          server from the perspective of an Internet-based
          mail server, it acts as a gateway and translator,
          adding the internal state data that is used within
          and between the MMS Environments.  This mechanism is
          described in [17], which also includes references to
          the specifications agreed by those bodies
          responsible for the design of the MMS.

          Note that MMS can be used as an alternative to
          deliver an SMS RP-DATA RPDU if, for example, the
          SMS bearer is not supported.  If an entry includes
          this Enumservice, then in effect this can be taken
          as implying that the recipient is capable of
          receiving EMS or SMS messages at this address.  Such
          choices on the end system design do have two small
          caveats; whilst in practice all terminals supporting
          MMS today support SMS as well, it might not
          necessarily be the case in the future, and there may
          be tariff differences in using the MMS rather than
          using the SMS or EMS.

        <paragraph>The kind of subsystem required to initiate a

          This is a subsystem that either provides a local
          connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that provides an
          indirect connection to those networks.  The
          subsystem will use the telephone number held in the

          is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to

          Provider that accepts call initiation requests from
          that subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as
          SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using
          a remote gateway service.  In this case, the Provider
          may either accept requests using "tel:" URIs or has
          a defined mechanism to convert "tel:" URI values
          into a "protocol-native" form.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified
          (using the "global phone number" form of RFC 3966
          [10]).  A "local phone number" as defined in that
          document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller of
          the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure that it
          can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients

 Enumservice Registrations

 (last updated 2009-10-13)

 Registries included below:
 - Enumservice Registrations

 Registry Name: Enumservice Registrations
 Reference: [RFC3761]
 Registration Procedures: Require an RFC approved by the IESG

 Note:
 Enumservice specifications contain the functional specification (i.e.
 what it can be used for), the valid protocols, and the URI schemes
 that may be returned.

 Service Name: "web"
     Type: "web"
     Subtype: "http"
     URI Scheme: 'http:'
     Functional Specification:
        This ENUMservice indicates that the resource identified by the
        associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of
        information.  It has to be noted that the kind of information
        retrieved can be manifold.  Usually, contacting a resource by an
        'http:' URI provides a document.  This document can contain
        references that will trigger download of many different kinds
        of information, like audio or video or executable code.  Thus,
        one can not be more specific about the kind of information that
        can be expected when contacting the resource.

     Functional Specification:
        This ENUMservice indicates that the resource identified by the
        associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of
        information, which can be contacted by using TLS or Secure
        Socket Layer protocol.  It has to be noted that the kind of
        information retrieved can be manifold.  Usually, contacting a
        resource by an 'https:' URI provides a document.  This document
        can contain all different kind of information, like audio or
        video or executable code.  Thus, one can not be more specific
        what information to expect when contacting the resource.

    Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
    URI Scheme: 'tel:'
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
       associated URI scheme is capable of being contacted to provide
       a communication session during which facsimile documents can be
       sent.
       A client selecting this NAPTR will have support for generating
       and sending facsimile documents to the recipient using the PSTN
       session and transfer protocols specified in [12] and [13] in
       [RFC4355]  - in short, they will have a fax
       program with a local or shared PSTN access over which they can
       send faxes.

 Enumservice Name: "sms"
    Enumservice Type: "sms"
    Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto"
    URI Scheme: 'mailto:'
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
       associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using
       an email protocol.
       SMS content is sent over SMTP using the format specified by TS
       23.140 [15] section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] section 4 (for
       references see [RFC4355]), as an MMS message.  Within such a
       message, SMS content is carried as either a text or
       application/octet-stream MIME sub-part (see TS 26.140 [16] ,
       section 4.1)
       For references see [RFC4355].
    Security Considerations:

 Enumservice Name: "ems"
    Enumservice Type: "ems"
    Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
    URI Scheme: 'tel:'
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
       associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using
       the Enhanced Message Service (EMS) [14] (For reference see
       [RFC4355]).
    Security Considerations:
       There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
       However, the general considerations of Section 6 apply.

       contact detail see [RFC4355])
    Any other information the author deems interesting:
       Note that an indication of EMS can be taken as implying that
       the recipient is capable of receiving SMS messages at this
       address as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Enumservice Name: "ems"
    Enumservice Type: "ems"
    Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto"
    URI Scheme: 'mailto:'
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
       associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using
       an email protocol.
       EMS content is sent over SMTP using the format specified by TS
       23.140 [15] section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] section 4, as an
       MMS message.  Within such a message, EMS content is carried as
       either a text or application/octet-stream MIME sub-part (see
       TS 26.140 [16] , section 4.1).
       For references see [RFC4355]
    Security Considerations:

 Enumservice Name: "mms"
    Enumservice Type: "mms"
    Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
    URI Scheme: 'tel:'
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
       associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using
       the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) [15].
       For references see [RFC4355]
    Security Considerations:
       There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
       However, the general considerations of Section 6 of [RFC4355]
       apply.
    Intended Usage: COMMON
    Authors:
       Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
       contact detail see [RFC4355])
    Any other information the author deems interesting:
       Note that MMS can be used as an alternative to deliver an SMS
       RP-DATA RPDU if, for example, the SMS bearer is not supported.
       If an entry includes this Enumservice, then in effect this can
       be taken as implying that the recipient is capable of receiving
       EMS or SMS messages at this address.  Such choices on the end
       system design do have two small caveats; whilst in practice all
       terminals supporting MMS today support SMS as well, it might
       not necessarily be the case in the future, and there may be
       tariff differences in using the MMS rather than using the SMS
       or EMS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Enumservice Name: "mms"
    Enumservice Type: "mms"
    Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto"
    URI Scheme: 'mailto:'
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
       associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using
       an email protocol.
       MMS messages are sent over SMTP using the format specified by
       TS 23.140 [15] section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] section 4.
       Within and between MMS Environments (MMSE, network
       infrastructures that support the MultiMedia Service), other
       pieces of state data (for example, charging-significant
       information) are exchanged between MMS Relay Servers.  Thus,
       although these servers use SMTP as the "bearer" for their
       application exchanges, they map their internal state to
       specialised headers carried in the SMTP message exchanges.
       The headers used in such MMSE are described in detail in [17].
       For references see [RFC4355]
    Security Considerations:
       There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
       However, the general considerations of Section 6 of [RFC4355]
       apply.
    Intended Usage: COMMON
    Authors:
       Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
       contact detail see [RFC4355])
    Any other information the author deems interesting:
       The MMS Architecture describes an interface between the MMSE and
       "legacy messaging systems" (labelled as MM3) which accepts
       "standard" SMTP messages.  Thus although the MMS Relay Server
       that supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP server
       from the perspective of an Internet-based mail server, it acts
       as a gateway and translator, adding the internal state data that
       is used within and between the MMS Environments.  This mechanism
       is described in [17], which also includes references to the
       specifications agreed by those bodies responsible for the design
       of the MMS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Service Name: E.164 to VPIM MailTo: URL
    URI Type: "Mailto:"
    Type: VPIM
    Subtype: MAILTO
    Functional Specification: See section 4.2 through 4.4 of [RFC4238]
    Intended Usage: COMMON
    Author: Greg Vaudreuil (gregv&ieee.org)
    Error Conditions:
       o E.164 number not in the numbering plan
       o E.164 number in the numbering plan, but no URLs exist for that
         number
       o E2U+VPIM:Mailto Service unavailable
    Security Considerations:
       o Malicious Redirection
         One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as
         this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will
         cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong email URL.
         The possible intent may be to cause the client to send the
         information to an incorrect destination.
       o Denial of Service
         By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a malicious
         intruder may remove the client's ability to access the
         resource.
       o Unsolicited Bulk Email
         The exposure of email addresses through the ENUM
         service provides a bulk mailer access to large numbers
         of email addresses where only the telephone number was
         previously known.
 Service Name: E.164 to VPIM LDAP URL
    URI Type: "LDAP:"
    Type: VPIM
    Subtype: LDAP
    Functional Specification: See section 3.2 through 3.3 of [RFC4238]
    Intended Usage: COMMON
    Author: Greg Vaudreuil (gregv&ieee.org)
    Security Considerations:
       o Malicious Redirection
         One of the fundamental dangers related to any service
         such as this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's
         database will cause clients to resolve the E.164 into
         the wrong LDAP URL.  The possible intent may be to cause
         the client to connect to a rogue LDAP server and
         retrieve (or fail to retrieve) a resource containing
         fraudulent or damaging information.
       o Denial of Service
         By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a
         malicious intruder may remove the client's ability to
         access the LDAP directory server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Enumservice Name: "voice"
    Enumservice Type: "voice"
    Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
    URI Scheme: 'tel:'
    Functional Specification:
       The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is
       "Interactive Voice".  From a protocol perspective, this
       communication is expected to involve bidirectional media streams
       carrying audio data.
       A client may imply that the person controlling population of a
       NAPTR holding this Enumservice indicates their capability to
       engage in an interactive voice session when contacted using the
       URI generated by this NAPTR.
    Security Considerations:
       See Section 5 of [RFC4415]
    Intended Usage: COMMON
    Authors:  Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for
              author contact detail see Authors' Addresses section)
    Any other information the author deems interesting:
     o This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for the
       NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
       Network) or PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value of
       the generated URI.
     o The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice
       with this sub-type is a "Dialler".  This is a subsystem that
       either provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that
       provides an indirect connection to those networks.  The
       subsystem will use the telephone number held in the generated
       URI to place a voice call.  The voice call is placed to a
       network that uses E.164 numbers to route calls to an appropriate
       destination.
     o Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end
       user receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a
       Communications Service Provider that accepts call initiation
       requests from that subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as
       SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using a remote
       gateway service.  In this case the Provider may either accept
       requests using "tel:" URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert
       "tel:" URI values into a "protocol-native" form.
     o The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the
       "global phone number" form of RFC3966 [10]).  A "local phone
       number" as defined in that document SHOULD NOT be used unless
       the controller of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure
       that it can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients that
       can access the resource record and that a call from their
       network access points can be routed to that destination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Enumservice Name: "pstn"
    Enumservice Type: "pstn"
    Enumservice Subtype: "tel"

    Functional Specification:
       These Enumservices indicate that the remote resource identified
       can be addressed by the associated URI scheme in order to
       initiate a telecommunication session, which may include two-way
       voice or other communications, to the PSTN.  These URIs may

    URI scheme(s): "im:"
    Functional Specification:
       This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified
       is an 'im:' URI.  The 'im:' URI scheme does not identify
       any particular protocol that will be used to handle
       instant messaging receipt or delivery, rather the mechanism
       in RFC 3861 [4] is used to discover whether an IM protocol
       supported by the party querying ENUM is also supported by
       the target resource.
