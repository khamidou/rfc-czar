                  RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Port for
                Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) Sessions

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows
   RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic.  In RTP-based source-specific
   multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the
   address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP
   description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session
   itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,
   and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media
   description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an
   unnecessary restriction.  This document removes this restriction by
   introducing a new SDP attribute.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] has an attribute
   that allows RTP applications [RFC3550] to specify an address and a
   port associated with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic
   [RFC3605].  This attribute is called 'rtcp'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Now consider a network where one or more media senders send RTP
   packets to a distribution source, which then multicasts these RTP
   packets to multicast receivers using a source-specific multicast
   (SSM) arrangement [RFC5760].  The distribution source also multicasts
   the forward RTCP traffic (i.e., RTCP sender reports and receiver
   reports or their summaries) to the receivers in the same SSM session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In RTP-based SSM sessions, the 'rtcp' attribute is used to designate
   the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP
   description [RFC5760].  However, the RTCP port associated with the
   SSM session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute since it
   could potentially cause ambiguity.  Thus, the multicast RTCP port is
   required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media description
   (see Section 10.2 of [RFC5760]) by following the +1 rule (see Section
   11 of [RFC3550]).  However, [RFC3550] lifted the requirement for the
   +1 rule since it imposed an unnecessary restriction on RTCP port
   selection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this specification, we introduce a new SDP attribute to remove
   this restriction.  The new attribute allows the multicast sender to
   use its desired port in the RTCP session.  This document updates
   [RFC5760].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The 'multicast-rtcp' Attribute</h2></a>

   In RTP-based SSM sessions, the distribution source can use different
   multicast RTP and RTCP ports to send the RTP and RTCP packets,
   respectively.  Alternatively, the distribution source can use RTP/
   RTCP port muxing [RFC5761], in which case the RTP and RTCP packets
   are sent to the same destination port in the SSM session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the cases when the distribution source does not want to use the
   one higher port for the RTCP traffic, this document defines a new SDP
   attribute, called 'multicast-rtcp'.  By using this attribute, the
   distribution source uses a desired port for the SSM RTCP session.  In
   the absence of the 'multicast-rtcp' attribute, the +1 rule applies
   following [RFC5760].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following ABNF [RFC5234] syntax formally describes the
   'multicast-rtcp' attribute:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">               rtcp-attribute = "a=multicast-rtcp:" port CRLF

         Figure 1: ABNF syntax for the 'multicast-rtcp' attribute

   Here, the 'port' token is defined as specified in Section 9 of
   [RFC4566].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The 'multicast-rtcp' attribute is defined as both a media-level and
   session-level attribute.  Except where stated otherwise in this
   document, the rules of [RFC3550] apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   SDP Example</h2></a>

   In the session description shown in Figure 2, a source stream is
   multicast from a distribution source (with a source IP address of
   198.51.100.1) to the multicast destination address of 233.252.0.2 and
   port 41000.  The forward RTCP traffic is multicast in the same
   multicast group but to port 42000 as specified by the "a=multicast-
   rtcp:42000" line.  A feedback target with an address of 192.0.2.1 and
   port of 43000 is specified by the 'rtcp' attribute.

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The 'multicast-rtcp' attribute is not believed to introduce any
   significant security risk to multimedia applications.  A malevolent
   third party could use this attribute to redirect the RTCP traffic,
   but this requires intercepting and rewriting the packets carrying the
   SDP description; and if an interceptor can do that, many more attacks
   are possible, including a wholesale change of the addresses and port
   numbers at which the media will be sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to
   be integrity protected and provided with source authentication.  This
   can, for example, be achieved on an end-to-end basis using S/MIME
   [RFC5652] [RFC5751] when SDP is used in a signaling packet using MIME
   types (application/sdp).  Alternatively, HTTPS [RFC2818] or the
   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974] could be used as well.
