</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   In X.500 directories, subentries are special entries used to hold
   information associated with a subtree or subtree refinement.  This
   document adapts X.500 subentries mechanisms for use with the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Overview</h2></a>

   From [X.501]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       A subentry is a special kind of entry immediately subordinate to
       an administrative point.  It contains attributes that pertain to
       a subtree (or subtree refinement) associated with its
       administrative point.  The subentries and their administrative
       point are part of the same naming context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       A single subentry may serve all or several aspects of
       administrative authority.  Alternatively, a specific aspect of
       administrative authority may be handled through one or more of
       its own subentries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subentries in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
   [RFC3377] SHALL behave in accordance with X.501 unless noted
   otherwise in this specification.
   In absence of the subentries control (detailed in Section 3),
   subentries SHALL NOT be considered in one-level and subtree scope
   search operations.  For all other operations, including base scope
   search operations, subentries SHALL be considered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Conventions</h3></a>

   Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
   [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped)
   for readability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680].  The term "BER-
   encoded" means the element is to be encoded using the Basic Encoding
   Rules [X.690] under the restrictions detailed in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC2251].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Subentry Schema</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Subtree Specification Syntax</h3></a>

   The Subtree Specification syntax provides a general purpose mechanism
   for the specification of a subset of entries in a subtree of the
   Directory Information Tree (DIT).  A subtree begins at some base
   entry and includes the subordinates of that entry down to some
   identified lower boundary, possibly extending to the leaf entries.  A
   subtree specification is always used within a context or scope which
   implicitly determines the bounds of the subtree.  For example, the
   scope of a subtree specification for a subschema administrative area
   does not include the subtrees of any subordinate administrative point
   entries for subschema administration.  Where a subtree specification
   does not identify a contiguous subset of the entries within a single
   subtree the collection is termed a subtree refinement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This syntax corresponds to the SubtreeSpecification ASN.1 type
   described in [X.501], Section 11.3.  This ASN.1 data type definition
   is reproduced here for completeness.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     SubtreeSpecification ::= SEQUENCE {
         base                [0] LocalName DEFAULT { },
                                 COMPONENTS OF ChopSpecification,
         specificationFilter [4] Refinement OPTIONAL }

     LocalName ::= RDNSequence
     ChopSpecification ::= SEQUENCE {
         specificExclusions  [1] SET OF CHOICE {
                                 chopBefore [0] LocalName,
                                 chopAfter [1] LocalName } OPTIONAL,
         minimum             [2] BaseDistance DEFAULT 0,
         maximum             [3] BaseDistance OPTIONAL }

     BaseDistance ::= INTEGER (0 .. MAX)

     Refinement ::= CHOICE {
         item                [0] OBJECT-CLASS.&id,
         and                 [1] SET OF Refinement,
         or                  [2] SET OF Refinement,
         not                 [3] Refinement }

   The components of SubtreeSpecification are: base, which identifies
   the base entry of the subtree or subtree refinement, and
   specificExclusions, minimum, maximum and specificationFilter, which
   then reduce the set of subordinate entries of the base entry.  The
   subtree or subtree refinement contains all the entries within scope
   that are not excluded by any of the components of the subtree
   specification.  When all of the components of SubtreeSpecification
   are absent (i.e., when a value of the Subtree Specification syntax is
   the empty sequence, {}), the specified subtree implicitly includes
   all the entries within scope.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any particular use of this mechanism MAY impose limitations or
   constraints on the components of SubtreeSpecification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LDAP syntax specification is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.45 DESC 'SubtreeSpecification' )

   The LDAP-specific encoding of values of this syntax is defined by the
   Generic String Encoding Rules [RFC3641].  Appendix A provides an
   equivalent Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC2234] for this
   syntax.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.1"><h4>2.1.1   Base</h4></a>

   The base component of SubtreeSpecification nominates the base entry
   of the subtree or subtree refinement.  The base entry may be an entry
   which is subordinate to the root entry of the scope in which the
   subtree specification is used, in which case the base component
   contains a sequence of Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs) relative
   to the root entry of the scope, or may be the root entry of the scope
   itself (the default), in which case the base component is absent or
   contains an empty sequence of RDNs.
   Entries that are not subordinates of the base entry are excluded from
   the subtree or subtree refinement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.2"><h4>2.1.2   Specific Exclusions</h4></a>

   The specificExclusions component of a ChopSpecification is a list of
   exclusions that specify entries and their subordinates to be excluded
   from the subtree or subtree refinement.  The entry is specified by a
   sequence of RDNs relative to the base entry (i.e., a LocalName).
   Each exclusion is of either the chopBefore or chopAfter form.  If the
   chopBefore form is used then the specified entry and its subordinates
   are excluded from the subtree or subtree refinement.  If the
   chopAfter form is used then only the subordinates of the specified
   entry are excluded from the subtree or subtree refinement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.3"><h4>2.1.3   Minimum and Maximum</h4></a>

   The minimum and maximum components of a ChopSpecification allow the
   exclusion of entries based on their depth in the DIT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Entries that are less than the minimum number of RDN arcs below the
   base entry are excluded from the subtree or subtree refinement.  A
   minimum value of zero (the default) corresponds to the base entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Entries that are more than the maximum number of RDN arcs below the
   base entry are excluded from the subtree or subtree refinement.  An
   absent maximum component indicates that there is no upper limit on
   the number of RDN arcs below the base entry for entries in the
   subtree or subtree refinement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.4"><h4>2.1.4   Specification Filter</h4></a>

   The specificationFilter component is a boolean expression of
   assertions about the values of the objectClass attribute of the base
   entry and its subordinates.  A Refinement assertion item evaluates to
   true for an entry if that entry's objectClass attribute contains the
   OID nominated in the assertion.  Entries for which the overall filter
   evaluates to false are excluded from the subtree refinement.  If the
   specificationFilter is absent then no entries are excluded from the
   subtree or subtree refinement because of their objectClass attribute
   values.
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Administrative Role Attribute Type</h3></a>

   The Administrative Model defined in [X.501], clause 10 requires that
   administrative entries contain an administrativeRole attribute to
   indicate that the associated administrative area is concerned with
   one or more administrative roles.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The administrativeRole operational attribute is specified as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 2.5.18.5 NAME 'administrativeRole'
           EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
           USAGE directoryOperation
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 )

   The possible values of this attribute defined in X.501 are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        OID            NAME
        --------  -------------------------------
       2.5.23.1   autonomousArea
       2.5.23.2   accessControlSpecificArea
       2.5.23.3   accessControlInnerArea
       2.5.23.4   subschemaAdminSpecificArea
       2.5.23.5   collectiveAttributeSpecificArea
       2.5.23.6   collectiveAttributeInnerArea

   Other values may be defined in other specifications.  Names
   associated with each administrative role are Object Identifier
   Descriptors [RFC3383].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The administrativeRole operational attribute is also used to regulate
   the subentries permitted to be subordinate to an administrative
   entry.  A subentry not of a class permitted by the administrativeRole
   attribute cannot be subordinate to the administrative entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Subtree Specification Attribute Type</h3></a>

   The subtreeSpecification operational attribute is defined as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 2.5.18.6 NAME 'subtreeSpecification'
           SINGLE-VALUE
           USAGE directoryOperation
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.45 )

   This attribute is present in all subentries.  See [X.501], clause 10.
   Values of the subtreeSpecification attribute nominate collections of
   entries within the DIT for one or more aspects of administrative
   authority.
	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Subentry Object Class</h3></a>

   The subentry object class is a structural object class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">       ( 2.5.17.0 NAME 'subentry'
           SUP top STRUCTURAL
           MUST ( cn $ subtreeSpecification ) )

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Subentries Control</h2></a>

   The subentries control MAY be sent with a searchRequest to control
   the visibility of entries and subentries which are within scope.
   Non-visible entries or subentries are not returned in response to the
   request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The subentries control is an LDAP Control whose controlType is
   1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.10.1, criticality is TRUE or FALSE (hence absent),
   and controlValue contains a BER-encoded BOOLEAN indicating
   visibility.  A controlValue containing the value TRUE indicates that
   subentries are visible and normal entries are not.  A controlValue
   containing the value FALSE indicates that normal entries are visible
   and subentries are not.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that TRUE visibility has the three octet encoding { 01 01 FF }
   and FALSE visibility has the three octet encoding { 01 01 00 }.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The controlValue SHALL NOT be absent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In absence of this control, subentries are not visible to singleLevel
   and wholeSubtree scope Search requests but are visible to baseObject
   scope Search requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no corresponding response control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This control is not appropriate for non-Search operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Subentries often hold administrative information or other sensitive
   information and should be protected from unauthorized access and
   disclosure as described in [RFC2829][RFC2830].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   General LDAP [RFC3377] security considerations also apply.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Descriptors</h3></a>
