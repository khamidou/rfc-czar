                NEW CONSOLE ATTACHMENTS TO THE UCSB HOST



   The MLC/360M
   ---------------

   The UCSB 360-75 is equipped with an interface unit that allows
   attachment of any type of I/O device to the Multiplexor Channel and
   for that device to be operated by program control as though it were a
   standard IBM Control Unit.  The interface, referred to as the
   Multi-Line Controller/360M (MLC/360M), operates on the Multiplexor
   Channel and provides 32 independently addressed I/O connections that
   are grouped into 16 pairs to accommodate full- duplex I/O operation.
   Each input group has a 16-bit input buffer plus related synchronizing
   and control logic to make it a stand-alone control unit on the 360
   channel.  Similarly, each output group has a 32-bit buffer plus logic.
   Attachment is achieved by connection through a data-set type connector
   and I/O signal levels conform to EIA standards (RS-232 Spec.).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   Both the I/O group hardware and the supporting software for the
   MLC/360M are readily modified to produce any variations required for
   attachment and operation of non-standard devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   Since our primary support was for 201B data-sets at 2400 baud, we
   first implemented the 16 I/O group pairs to accommodate this type of
   modem in our time-shared user environment.  The I/O groups have now
   been variously modified to support a wide range of applications, from
   300 baud acoustic coupled use to 9600 baud for multi-station classroom
   operation.

   New Consoles
   ---------------


   In addition to our standard attachments, which are mostly Culler-Fried
   graphic display consoles and educational classrooms




                                                                [Page 1]

   using such consoles, we have a Tektronix 4002A and an NIH General
   Purpose Graphics Terminal (GPGT).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   The Tektronix terminal can now be operated on the ARPANET and will
   provide our users with upper and lower case ASCII for easier operation
   with other sites.  A report on this console's capability will be
   forthcoming.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   The GPGT was developed by the University of IOWA for use in
   Bio-Medical applications.  The unit is a delay-line refreshed video
   display with graphic capability and is the only dynamic type display
   in use on our host computer at present.  We are evaluating its
   performance in our On-Line System environment.  Since a user at this
   terminal is also able to reach into the network, we will have some
   future comments on its operation for interested persons.
