	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes how access networks, Session Initiation
   Protocol [RFC3261] user agents, proxy servers, and Public Safety
   Answering Points (PSAPs) support emergency calling, as outlined in
   [RFC6443], which is designed to complement the present document in
   section headings, numbering, and content.  Understanding [RFC6443] is
   necessary to understand this document.  This Best Current Practice
   (BCP) succinctly describes the requirements of end devices and
   applications (requirements prefaced by "ED-"), access networks
   (including enterprise access networks) (requirements prefaced by
   "AN-"), service providers (requirements prefaced by "SP-"), and PSAPs
   to achieve globally interoperable emergency calling on the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document also defines requirements for "intermediate" devices
   that exist between end devices or applications and the access
   network.  For example, a home router is an intermediate device.
   Reporting location on an emergency call (see Section 6) may depend on
   the ability of such intermediate devices to meet the requirements
   prefaced by "INT-".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The access network requirements apply to those networks that may be
   used to place emergency calls using IETF protocols.  Local
   regulations may impact the need to support this document's access
   network requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other organizations, such as the National Emergency Number
   Association (NENA), define the PSAP interface.  NENA's documents
   reference this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document uses terms from [RFC3261], [RFC5012], and [RFC6443].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview of How Emergency Calls Are Placed</h2></a>

   An emergency call can be distinguished (Section 5) from any other
   call by a unique service URN [RFC5031] that is placed in the call
   setup signaling when a home or visited emergency dial string is
   detected.  Because emergency services are local to specific
   geographic regions, a caller must obtain his location (Section 6)
   prior to making emergency calls.  To get this location, either a form
   of measuring (e.g., GPS) ([RFC6443] Section 6.2.3) device location in
   the endpoint is deployed or the endpoint is configured (Section 6.5)
   with its location from the access network's Location Information
   Server (LIS).  The location is conveyed (Section 6.7) in the SIP
   signaling with the call.  The call is routed (Section 8) based on
   location using the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol
   [RFC5222], which maps a location to a set of PSAP URIs.  Each URI
   resolves to a PSAP or an Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) that
   serves a group of PSAPs.  The call arrives at the PSAP with the
   location included in the SIP INVITE request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Which Devices and Services Should Support Emergency Calls?</h2></a>

   ED-1:  A device or application that implements SIP calling SHOULD
      support emergency calling.  Some jurisdictions have regulations
      governing which devices need to support emergency calling, and
      developers are encouraged to ensure that devices they develop meet
      relevant regulatory requirements.  Unfortunately, the natural
      variation in those regulations also makes it impossible to
      accurately describe the cases when developers do or do not have to
      support emergency calling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SP-1:  If a device or application expects to be able to place a call
      for help, the service provider that supports it MUST facilitate
      emergency calling.  Some jurisdictions have regulations governing
      this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-2:  Devices that create media sessions and exchange real-time
      audio, video, and/or text and that have the capability to
      establish sessions to a wide variety of addresses and communicate
      over private IP networks or the Internet SHOULD support emergency
      calls.  Some jurisdictions have regulations governing this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Identifying an Emergency Call</h2></a>

   ED-3:  Endpoints SHOULD recognize dial strings of emergency calls.
      If the service provider always knows the location of the device
      (the correct dial string depends on which country a caller is in),
      the service provider may recognize them; see SP-2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SP-2:  Proxy servers SHOULD recognize emergency dial strings if for
      some reason the endpoint does not recognize them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-4/SP-3:  Emergency calls MUST be marked with a service URN in the
      Request-URI of the INVITE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-5/SP-4:  Geographically local dial strings MUST be recognized.
   ED-6/SP-5:  Devices MUST be able to be configured with the home
      country from which the home dial string(s) can be determined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-7/SP-6:  Emergency dial strings SHOULD be determined from LoST
      [RFC5222].  Dial strings MAY be configured directly into the
      device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-1:  LoST servers MUST return dial strings for emergency services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-8:  Endpoints that do not recognize emergency dial strings SHOULD
      send dial strings as per [RFC4967].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SP-7:  If a proxy server recognizes dial strings on behalf of its
      clients, it MUST recognize emergency dial strings represented by
      [RFC4967] and SHOULD recognize the emergency dial strings
      represented by a tel URI [RFC3966].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-9:  Endpoints SHOULD be able to have home dial strings
      provisioned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SP-8:  Service providers MAY provision home dial strings in devices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-10:  Devices SHOULD NOT have one-button emergency calling
      initiation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-11/SP-9:  All sub-services for the 'sos' service specified in
      [RFC5031] MUST be recognized.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Location and Its Role in an Emergency Call</h2></a>

   Handling location for emergency calling usually involves several
   steps to process, and multiple entities are involved.  In Internet
   emergency calling, where the endpoint is located is determined using
   a variety of measurement or wire-tracing methods.  Endpoints can be
   configured with their own location by the access network.  In some
   circumstances, a proxy server can insert location into the signaling
   on behalf of the endpoint.  The location is mapped to the URI to send
   the call to, and the location is conveyed to the PSAP (and other
   entities) in the signaling.  Likewise, we employ Location
   Configuration Protocols (LCPs), the Location-to-Service Mapping
   Protocol, and Location Conveyance Protocols for these functions.  The
   Location-to-Service Translation protocol [RFC5222] is the Location
   Mapping Protocol defined by the IETF.
	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Types of Location Information</h3></a>

   There are several forms of location.  All IETF location configuration
   and location conveyance protocols support both civic and geospatial
   (geo) forms.  The civic forms include both postal and jurisdictional
   fields.  A cell tower/sector can be represented as a point (geo or
   civic) or polygon.  Endpoints, intermediate devices, and service
   providers receiving other forms of location representation MUST map
   them into either a geo or civic for use in emergency calls.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-12/INT-1/SP-10:  Endpoints, intermediate devices, and service
      providers MUST be prepared to handle location represented in
      either civic or geo form.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-13/INT-2/SP-11/AN-2:  Entities MUST NOT convert (civic to geo or
      geo to civic) from the form of location that the determination
      mechanism (see Section 6.2) supplied prior to receipt by the PSAP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Location Determination</h3></a>

   ED-14/INT-3/AN-3:  Any location determination mechanism MAY be used,
      provided the accuracy of the location meets local requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.1"><h4>6.2.1   User-Entered Location Information</h4></a>

   ED-15/INT-4/AN-4:  Devices, intermediate devices, and/or access
      networks SHOULD support a manual method to override the location
      the access network determines.  When the override location is
      supplied in civic form, it MUST be possible for the resultant
      Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)
      received at the PSAP to contain any of the elements specified in
      [RFC4119] and [RFC5139].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.2"><h4>6.2.2   Access Network "Wire Database" Location Information</h4></a>

   AN-5:  Access networks supporting copper, fiber, or other hard-wired
      IP packet services SHOULD support location configuration.  If the
      network does not support location configuration, it MUST require
      every device or intermediate device that connects to the network
      to support end system measured location.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-6/INT-5:  Access networks and intermediate devices providing wire
      database location information SHOULD provide interior location
      data (building, floor, room, cubicle) where possible.  It is
      RECOMMENDED that interior location be provided when spaces exceed
      approximately 650 square meters.  See [RFC6443] Section 6.2.2 for
      a discussion of how this value was determined.
   AN-7/INT-6:  Access networks and intermediate devices (including
      enterprise networks) that support intermediate range wireless
      connections (typically 100 m or less of range) and that do not
      support a more accurate location determination mechanism such as
      triangulation MUST support location configuration where the
      location of the access point is reflected as the location of the
      clients of that access point.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-8/INT-7:  Where the access network provides location
      configuration, intermediate devices MUST either be transparent to
      it or provide an interconnected client for the supported
      configuration mechanism and a server for a configuration protocol
      supported by end devices downstream of the intermediate device
      such that the location provided by the access network is available
      to clients as if the intermediate device was not in the path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.3"><h4>6.2.3   End System Measured Location Information</h4></a>

   ED-16/INT-8:  Devices MAY support end system measured location.  See
      [RFC6443] Section 6 for a discussion of accuracy of location.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-17/INT-9/AN-9:  Devices that support endpoint measuring of
      location MUST have at least a coarse location capability
      (typically <1 km accuracy) for the routing of calls.  The location
      mechanism MAY be a service provided by the access network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.4"><h4>6.2.4   Network Measured Location Information</h4></a>

   AN-10:  Access networks MAY provide network measured location
      determination.  Wireless access networks that do not supply
      network measured location MUST require every device or
      intermediate device connected to the network to support end system
      measured location.  Uncertainty and confidence may be specified by
      local regulation.  Where not specified, uncertainty of less than
      100 meters with 95% confidence is RECOMMENDED for dispatch
      location.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-11:  Access networks that provide network measured location MUST
      have at least a coarse location (typically <1 km when not location
      hiding) capability at all times for the routing of calls.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-12:  Access networks with a range of <10 meters (e.g., personal
      area networks such as Bluetooth) MUST provide a location to mobile
      devices connected to them.  The location provided SHOULD be that
      reported by the upstream access network unless a more accurate
      mechanism is available.
	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Who Adds Location?  The Endpoint, or the Proxy?</h3></a>

   ED-18/INT-10:  Endpoints SHOULD attempt to configure their own
      location using the Location Configuration Protocols (LCPs) listed
      in ED-21.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SP-12: Proxies MAY provide location on behalf of devices if:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The proxy has a relationship with all access networks the device
      could connect to, and the relationship allows it to obtain
      location.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The proxy has an identifier, such as an IP address, that can be
      used by the access network to determine the location of the
      endpoint, even in the presence of NAT and VPN tunnels that may
      obscure the identifier between the access network and the service
      provider.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-19/INT-11/SP-13:  Where proxies provide location on behalf of
      endpoints, the service provider MUST ensure that either the end
      device is provided with the local dial strings for its current
      location (where the end device recognizes dial strings) or the
      service provider proxy MUST detect the appropriate local dial
      strings at the time of the call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.4"><h3>6.4   Location and References to Location</h3></a>

   ED-20/INT-12:  Devices SHOULD be able to accept and forward location-
      by-value or location-by-reference.  An end device that receives
      location-by-reference (and does not also get the corresponding
      value) MUST be able to perform a dereference operation to obtain a
      value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5"><h3>6.5   End System Location Configuration</h3></a>

   Obtaining location from the access network may be preferable even if
   the device can measure its own location, especially indoors where
   most measurement mechanisms are not accurate enough.  The
   requirements listed in this section do not apply to devices that can
   accurately measure their own location.
   ED-21/INT-13:  Devices MUST support both the Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol (DHCP) location options [RFC4776] [RFC6225]
      and HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) [RFC5985].  When devices
      deploy a specific access network interface for which location
      configuration mechanisms such as Link Layer Discovery Protocol -
      Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) [LLDP-MED] or 802.11v are
      specified, the device SHOULD support the additional respective
      access network specific location configuration mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-13/INT-14:  The access network MUST support either DHCP location
      options or HELD.  The access network SHOULD support other location
      configuration technologies that are specific to the type of access
      network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-14/INT-15:  Where a router is employed between a LAN and WAN in a
      small (less than approximately 650 square meters) area, the router
      MUST be transparent to the location provided by the WAN to the
      LAN.  This may mean the router must obtain location as a client
      from the WAN and supply an LCP server to the LAN with the location
      it obtains.  Where the area is larger, the LAN MUST have a
      location configuration mechanism satisfying the requirements of
      this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-22/INT-16:  Endpoints SHOULD try all LCPs supported by the device
      in any order or in parallel.  The first one that succeeds in
      supplying location MUST be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   AN-15/INT-17:  Access networks that support more than one LCP MUST
      reply with the same location information (within the limits of the
      data format for the specific LCP) for all LCPs it supports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-23/INT-18/SP-14:  When HELD is the LCP, the request MUST specify a
      value of "emergencyRouting" for the "responseTime" parameter and
      use the resulting location for routing.  If a value for dispatch
      location will be sent, another request with the "responseTime"
      parameter set to "emergencyDispatch" must be completed, with the
      result sent for dispatch purposes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-24:  Where the operating system supporting application programs
      that need location for emergency calls does not allow access to
      Layer 2 and Layer 3 functions necessary for a client application
      to use DHCP location options and/or other location technologies
      that are specific to the type of access network, the operating
      system MUST provide a published API conforming to ED-12 through
      ED-23 and ED-25 through ED-32.  It is RECOMMENDED that all
      operating systems provide such an API.
	<a name="section-6.6"><h3>6.6   When Location Should Be Configured</h3></a>

   If an endpoint is manually configured, the requirements in this
   section are not applicable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-25/INT-19:  Endpoints SHOULD obtain location immediately after
      obtaining local network configuration information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-26/INT-20:  If the device is configured to use DHCP for
      bootstrapping and does not use its own measurement to determine
      location, it MUST include both options for location acquisition
      (civic and geodetic), the option for LIS discovery, and the option
      for LoST discovery as defined in [RFC4776], [RFC6225], [RFC5986],
      and [RFC5223], respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-27/INT-21:  If the device sends a DHCPINFORM message, it MUST

      [RFC5223], respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-28/INT-22:  To minimize the effects of VPNs that do not allow
      packets to be sent via the native hardware interface rather than

        from LoST (see Section 8).  If the device does not interpret
        dial plans or was unable to obtain a route from a LoST server,
        no such Route header field will be present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.   A Contact header field MUST be globally routable, for example, a
        Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) [RFC5627], and be valid
        for several minutes following the termination of the call,
        provided that the User Agent Client (UAC) remains registered
        with the same registrar, to permit an immediate callback to the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   8.   If a device understands the SIP location conveyance [RFC6442]
        extension and has its location available, it MUST include
        location as either location-by-value or location-by-reference,
        or both, according to the rules within RFC 6442.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   9.   An SDP offer SHOULD be included in the INVITE.  If voice is
        supported, the offer SHOULD include the G.711 codec; see
        Section 14.  As PSAPs may support a wide range of media types
        and codecs, sending an offerless INVITE may result in a lengthy
        return offer but is permitted.  Cautions in [RFC3261] on
        offerless INVITEs should be considered before such use.
   10.  If the device includes location-by-value, the user agent (UA)
        MUST support multipart message bodies, since SDP will likely be

   SP-33: SIP proxy servers processing emergency calls:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  If the proxy interprets dial plans on behalf of user agents, the
       proxy MUST look for the local emergency dial string at the

       If it finds it, the proxy MUST:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  If the proxy recognizes the service URN in the Request URI and

       immediately.  If a location was provided (which should be the
       case), the proxy uses that location to query LoST.  The proxy may
       have to dereference a location-by-reference to get a value.  If a
       location is not present and the proxy can query a LIS that has
       the location of the UA, it MUST do so.  If no location is present
       and the proxy does not have access to a LIS that could provide
       location, the proxy MUST supply a default location (see
       Section 6.11).  The location (in the signaling, obtained from a
       LIS, or default) MUST be used in a query to LoST with the service
       URN received with the call.  The resulting URI MUST be placed in
       a Route header added to the call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  The proxy MAY add a Geolocation header field.  Such an additional

   4.  Either a P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325] or an Identity header
       field [RFC4474], or both, SHOULD be included to identify the
       sender.  For services that must support emergency calls from
       unauthenticated devices, valid identity may not be available.
       Proxies encountering a P-Asserted-Identity will need to pass the
       header to the PSAP, which is in a different domain.  [RFC3325]
       requires a "spec(T)" to determine what happens if either the "id"
       privacy service or a Privacy header is present and requests
       privacy.  In the absence of another spec(T), such proxies should
       pass the header unmodified if and only if the connection between
       the proxy and the PSAP is, as far as the proxy can determine,
       protected by TLS with mutual authentication using keys reliably
       known by the parties, encrypted with no less strength than AES,
       and the local regulations governing the PSAP do not specify
       otherwise.

   o  Call forward (all kinds)

   These features SHOULD be disabled for approximately 30 minutes
   following termination of an emergency call.
   ED-69:  Callbacks SHOULD be determined by retaining the domain of the
      PSAP that answers an outgoing emergency call and instantiating a
      timer that starts when the call is terminated.  If a call is
      received from the same domain and within the timer period, and it
      is sent to the URI in a Contact header or the AoR used in the
      emergency call, then it should be assumed to be a callback.  The
      suggested timer period is 5 minutes.  The mechanism described in
      [RFC4916] can be used by the PSAP to inform the endpoint of the
      PSAP's domain.  Recognizing a callback from the domain of the PSAP

   ED-77:  INVITE requests to a service URN starting with "test."
      indicate a request for an automated test, for example,
      "urn:service:test.sos.fire".  As in standard SIP, a 200 (OK)
      response indicates that the address was recognized and a 404 (not
      found) that it was not.  A 486 (busy here) MUST be returned if the
      test service is busy, and a 404 (not found) MUST be returned if
      the PSAP does not support the test mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-78:  In its response to the test, the PSAP MAY include a text body
      (text/plain) indicating the identity of the PSAP, the requested
      service, and the location reported with the call.  For the latter,
      the PSAP SHOULD return location-by-value even if the original
      location delivered with the test was location-by-reference.  If
      the location-by-reference was supplied and the dereference
      requires credentials, the PSAP SHOULD use credentials supplied by
      the LIS for test purposes.  This alerts the LIS that the
      dereference is not for an actual emergency call, and therefore
      location-hiding techniques, if they are being used, may be
      employed for this dereference.  Use of SIPS for the request would
      assure that the response containing the location is kept private.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-79:  A PSAP accepting a test call SHOULD accept a media loopback
      [RFC6849] test and SHOULD support the "rtp-pkt-loopback" and
      "rtp-media-loopback" options.  The user agent would specify a
      loopback attribute of "loopback-source", the PSAP being the
      mirror.  User agents should expect the PSAP to loop back no more
      than 3 packets of each media type accepted (which limits the
      duration of the test), after which the PSAP would normally send
      BYE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-80:  User agents SHOULD perform a full call test, including media
      loopback, after a disconnect and subsequent change in IP address
      not due to a reboot.  After an initial test, a full test SHOULD be
      repeated approximately every 30 days with a random interval.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-81:  User agents MUST NOT place a test call immediately after
      booting.  If the IP address changes after booting, the endpoint
      should wait a random amount of time (in perhaps a 30-minute
      period, sufficient for any avalanche-restart event to complete)
      and then test.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ED-82:  PSAPs MAY refuse repeated requests for test from the same
      device in a short period of time.  Any refusal is signaled with a
      486 (busy here) or 488 (not acceptable here) response.
	<a name="section-16"><h2>16.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security considerations for emergency calling have been documented in
   [RFC5069] and [RFC6280].  This document suggests that security (TLS
   or IPsec) be used hop by hop on a SIP call to protect location
   information, identity, etc.  It also suggests that if the attempt to
   create a security association fails the call be retried without the
   security.  It's more important to get an emergency call through than
   to protect the data; indeed, in many jurisdictions privacy is
   explicitly waived when making emergency calls.  Placing a call
   without security may reveal user information, including location.
   The alternative -- failing the call if security cannot be established
   -- is considered unacceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-17"><h2>17.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document registers service URNs in the Service URN Labels
   registry per [RFC5031] for testing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-17.1"><h3>17.1   Test Service URN</h3></a>

   A new entry in the URN Service Label registry has been added.  The
   new service is "test", the reference is this document, and the
   description is "self-test".
	<a name="section-17.2"><h3>17.2   'test' Subregistry</h3></a>

   A new subregistry has been created: 'test' Sub-Services.  The
   registration process is Expert Review per [RFC5226].  The expert
   review should consider that the entries in this registry nominally
   track the entries in the 'sos' subregistry, although it is not
   required that every entry in 'sos' have an entry in 'test', and it is
   possible that entries in the 'test' subregistry may not necessarily
   be in the 'sos' subregistry.  For example, testing of non-emergency
   URNs may be allowed.  The reference is this document.  The initial
   content of the subregistry is:
