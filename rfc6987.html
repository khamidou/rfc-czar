                     OSPF Stub Router Advertisement

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
   used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
   a router's unavailability to forward transit traffic or to lower the
   preference level for the paths through such a router.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers in a
   network not to use a specific router as a transit point but to still
   route to it.  Possible situations include the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The router is in a critical condition (for example, has a very
      high CPU load or does not have enough memory to store all Link
      State Advertisements (LSAs) or build the routing table).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the
      network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.
   Note that the solution introduced in this document does not remove
   the router from the topology view of the network (as could be done by
   just flushing that router's router-LSA) but discourages other routers
   from using it for transit routing, while still routing packets to the
   router's own IP addresses, i.e., the router is announced as a stub.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It must be emphasized that the solution provides real benefits in
   networks designed with at least some level of redundancy, so that
   traffic can be routed around the stub router.  Otherwise, traffic
   destined for the networks and reachable through such a stub router
   may still be routed through it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Solutions</h2></a>

   The solution introduced in this document solves two challenges
   associated with the outlined problem.  In the description below,
   router X is the router announcing itself as a stub.  The challenges
   are

   1) Making other routers prefer routes around router X while
      performing the Dijkstra calculation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly connected to
      router X.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that it would be easy to address issue 1) alone by just flushing
   router X's router-LSA from the domain.  However, it does not solve
   problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use links to
   router X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will not
   have links to its neighbors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To address both problems, router X announces its router-LSA to the
   neighbors with the cost of all non-stub links (links of the types
   other than 3) being set to MaxLinkMetric (defined in Section 3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The solution above applies to both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   OSPFv3-Only Solution</h3></a>

   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] introduces additional options to provide similar
   control of the forwarding topology; the R-bit provides an indication
   of whether a router is active and should be used for transit traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is left to network operators to decide which technique to use in
   their network.  See Section 4 for more details.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Maximum Link Metric</h2></a>

   Section 2 refers to the cost of all non-stub links as MaxLinkMetric,
   which is a new fixed architectural value introduced in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MaxLinkMetric
      The metric value indicating that a router-LSA link (see Section 2)
      should not be used for transit traffic.  It is defined to be the
      16-bit binary value of all ones: 0xffff.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Deployment Considerations</h2></a>

   When using MaxLinkMetric, some inconsistency may be seen if the
   network is constructed of routers that perform an intra-area Dijkstra
   calculation as specified in [RFC1247] (discarding link records in
   router-LSAs that have a MaxLinkMetric cost value) and routers that
   perform it as specified in [RFC1583] and higher (do not treat links
   with MaxLinkMetric cost as unreachable).  Note that this
   inconsistency will not lead to routing loops, because if there are
   some alternate paths in the network, both types of routers will agree
   on using them rather than the path through the stub router.  If the
   path through the stub router is the only one, the routers of the
   first type will not use the stub router for transit (which is the
   desired behavior), while the routers of the second type will still
   use this path.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   On the other hand, clearing the R-bit will consistently result in the
   router not being used for transit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of MaxLinkMetric or the R-bit in a network depends on the
   objectives of the operator.  One of the possible considerations for
   selecting one or the other is in the desired behavior if the path
   through the stub router is the only one available.  Using
   MaxLinkMetric allows for that path to be used while the R-bit
   doesn't.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The technique described in this document does not introduce any new
   security issues into the OSPF protocol.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 3137

   This document obsoletes [RFC3137].

</p>   In addition to editorial updates, this document defines a new
   architectural constant (MaxLinkMetric in Section 3) to eliminate any
   confusion about the interpretation of LSInfinity.  It also
   incorporates and explains the use of the R-bit [RFC5340] as a
   solution to the problem addressed in the text.
