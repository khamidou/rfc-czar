   This document defines attributes within RADIUS and Diameter that can
   be used to convey location-related information within authentication
   and accounting exchanges.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Location information may be useful in a number of scenarios.
   Wireless networks (including wireless LAN) are being deployed in
   public places such as airports, hotels, shopping malls, and coffee
   shops by a diverse set of operators such as cellular network
   operators, Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), and fixed
   broadband operators.  In these situations, the home network may need
   to know the location of the user in order to enable location-aware
   billing, location-aware authorization, or other location-aware
   services.  Location information can also prove useful in other
   situations (such as wired networks) where operator-network ownership
   and location information may be needed by the home network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to preserve user privacy, location information needs to be
   protected against unauthorized access and distribution.  Requirements
   for access to location information are defined in [RFC3693].  The
   model includes a Location Generator (LG) that creates location
   information, a Location Server (LS) that authorizes access to
   location information, a Location Recipient (LR) that requests and
   receives information, and a Rule Maker (RM) that provides
   authorization policies to the LS, which enforces access-control
   policies on requests to location information.  In Appendix A, the
   requirements for a GEOPRIV using protocol [RFC3693] are compared to
   the functionality provided by this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RADIUS-specific terminology is borrowed from [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Terminology related to privacy issues, location information, and
   authorization policy rules is taken from [RFC3693].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Delivery Methods for Location Information</h2></a>

   The following exchanges show how location information is conveyed in
   RADIUS.  In describing the usage scenarios, we assume that privacy
   policies allow location to be conveyed in RADIUS; however, as noted
   in Section 6, similar exchanges can also take place within Diameter.
   Privacy issues are discussed in Section 7.2.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Location Delivery Based on Out-of-Band Agreements</h3></a>

   Figure 1 shows an example message flow for delivering location
   information during the network-access authentication and
   authorization procedure.  Upon a network-authentication request from
   an access-network client, the Network Access Server (NAS) submits a
   RADIUS Access-Request message that contains Location-Information
   Attributes among other required attributes.  In this scenario,
   location information is attached to the Access-Request message
   without an explicit request from the RADIUS server.  Note that such
   an approach with a prior agreement between the RADIUS client and the
   RADIUS server is only applicable in certain environments, such as in
   situations where the RADIUS client and server are within the same
   administrative domain.  The Basic-Location-Policy-Rules Attribute is
   populated based on the defaults described in Section 4.4, unless it
   has been explicitly configured otherwise.

        Figure 1: Location Delivery Based on Out-of-Band Agreements
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Location Delivery Based on Initial Request</h3></a>

   If the RADIUS client provides a Location-Capable Attribute in the
   Access-Request, then the RADIUS server MAY request location
   information from the RADIUS client if it requires that information
   for authorization and if location information was not provided in the
   Access-Request.  This exchange is shown in Figure 2.  The inclusion
   of the Location-Capable Attribute in an Access-Request message
   indicates that the NAS is capable of providing location data in
   response to an Access-Challenge.  The subsequent Access-Challenge
   message sent from the RADIUS server to the NAS provides a hint
   regarding the type of desired Location-Information Attributes.  The
   NAS treats the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-
   Policy-Rules Attributes as opaque data (e.g., it echoes these rules
   provided by the server within the Access-Challenge back in the
   Access-Request).  In the shown message flow, the location attributes
   are then provided in the subsequent Access-Request message.  When
   evaluating this Access-Request message, the authorization procedure
   at the RADIUS server might be based on a number of criteria,
   including the newly defined attributes listed in Section 4.

           Figure 2: Location Delivery Based on Initial Request

	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Location Delivery Based on Mid-Session Request</h3></a>

   The on-demand, mid-session location-delivery method utilizes the
   Change-of-Authorization Request (CoA-Request) message and the CoA-NAK
   (CoA-Negative Acknowledgement), defined in [RFC5176].  At any time
   during the session, the Dynamic Authorization Client MAY send a CoA-
   Request containing session-identification attributes to the NAS
   (i.e., Dynamic Authorization Server).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to enable the on-demand, mid-session location-delivery
   method, the RADIUS server MUST return an instance of the Requested-
   Location-Info Attribute with the 'FUTURE_REQUESTS' flag set and
   instances of the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-
   Policy-Rules Attributes in the Access-Accept message for the session.
   Upon receipt of a CoA-Request message containing a Service-Type
   Attribute with value "Authorize Only" for the same session, the NAS
   MUST include location information and echo the previously received
   Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules
   Attributes in the subsequent Access-Request message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receiving the Access-Request message containing the Service-Type
   Attribute with a value of Authorize-Only from the NAS, the RADIUS
   server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject
   message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of dynamic authorization [RFC5176] is necessary when location
   information is needed on-demand and cannot be obtained from
   accounting information in a timely fashion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 3 shows the above-described approach graphically.

                       Service-Type 'Authorize Only'

   When the Dynamic Authorization Client wants to change the values of
   the requested location information, or set the values of the
   requested location information for the first time, it may do so
   without triggering a reauthorization.  Assuming that the NAS had
   previously sent an Access-Request containing a Location-Capable
   Attribute, the Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC) can send a CoA-
   Request to the NAS without a Service-Type Attribute, but include the
   NAS identifiers and session identifiers as per [RFC5176] and the
   Requested-Location-Info, Basic-Location-Policy-Rules, and Extended-
   Location-Policy-Rules Attributes.  The Requested-Location-Info,
   Basic-Location-Policy-Rules, and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules
   Attributes MUST NOT be used for session identification.

   Location information may also be reported in accounting messages.
   Accounting messages are generated when the session starts, when the
   session stops, and periodically during the lifetime of the session.
   Accounting messages may also be generated when the user roams during
   handoff.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Accounting information may be needed by the billing system to
   calculate the user's bill.  For example, there may be different
   tariffs or tax rates applied based on the location.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the RADIUS server needs to obtain location information in
   accounting messages, then it needs to include a Requested-Location-

   be echoed in the Accounting-Request if indicated in the Access-

   It is important to note that the location-specific parts of the
   attributes defined below are not meant to be processed by the RADIUS
   server.  Instead, a location-server-specific component used in
   combination with the RADIUS server is responsible for receiving,
   processing, and further distributing location information (in
   combination with proper access control and privacy protection).  As
   such, from a RADIUS server point of view, location information is
   treated as opaque data.
	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Operator-Name Attribute</h3></a>

   This attribute carries the operator namespace identifier and the
   operator name.  The operator name is combined with the namespace
   identifier to uniquely identify the owner of an access network.  The
   value of the Operator-Name is a non-NULL terminated text whose length
   MUST NOT exceed 253 bytes.

   proxy server) to indicate support for the functionality specified in
   this document.  The Location-Capable Attribute with the value for
   'Location Capable' MUST be sent with the Access-Request messages, if
   the NAS supports the functionality described in this document and is
   capable of sending location information.  A RADIUS server MUST NOT
   challenge for location information unless the Location-Capable
   Attribute has been sent to it.

   The Requested-Location-Info Attribute allows the RADIUS server to
   indicate which location information about which entity it wants to
   receive.  The latter aspect refers to the entities that are indicated
   in the Entity field of the Location-Information Attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Requested-Location-Info Attribute MAY be sent in an Access-
   Accept, Access-Challenge, or Change-of-Authorization packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the RADIUS server wants to dynamically decide on a per-request
   basis to ask for location information from the RADIUS client, then
   the following cases need to be differentiated.  If the RADIUS client
   and the RADIUS server have agreed out-of-band to mandate the transfer
   of location information for every network-access authentication
   request, then the processing listed below is not applicable.
   o  If the RADIUS server requires location information for computing
      the authorization decision and the RADIUS client does not provide
      it with the Access-Request message, then the Requested-Location-
      Info Attribute is attached to the Access-Challenge with a hint
      about what is required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the RADIUS server does not receive the requested information in
      response to the Access-Challenge (including the Requested-
      Location-Info Attribute), then the RADIUS server may respond with
      an Access-Reject message with an Error-Cause Attribute (including
      the "Location-Info-Required" value).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the RADIUS server would like location information in the
      Accounting-Request message but does not require it for computing
      an authorization decision, then the Access-Accept message MUST
      include a Required-Info Attribute.  This is typically the case
      when location information is used only for billing.  The RADIUS
      client SHOULD attach location information, if available, to the
      Accounting-Request (unless authorization policies dictate
      something different).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the RADIUS server does not send a Requested-Location-Info
   Attribute, then the RADIUS client MUST NOT attach location
   information to messages towards the RADIUS server.  The user's

   server before requesting location information delivery from the
   RADIUS client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 6 shows a simple protocol exchange where the RADIUS server
   indicates the desire to obtain location information, namely civic

   required for computing an authorization decision.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   A number of security aspects are relevant for the distribution of
   location information via RADIUS.  These aspects are discussed in
   separate subsections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   Communication Security</h3></a>

   Requirements for the protection of a Location Object are defined in
   [RFC3693] -- namely, mutual end-point authentication, data object
   integrity, data object confidentiality, and replay protection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If no authentication, integrity, and replay protection between the
   participating RADIUS entities is provided, then adversaries can spoof
   and modify transmitted attributes.  Two security mechanisms are
   proposed for RADIUS:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  [RFC2865] proposes the usage of a static key that raised concerns
      regarding the lack of dynamic key management.  At the time of
      writing, work is ongoing to address some shortcomings of the
      [RFC2865] attribute regarding security protection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  RADIUS over IPsec [RFC3579] enables the use of standard key-
      management mechanisms, such as Kerberized Internet Negotiation of
      Keys (KINK), the Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE), and IKEv2
      [RFC4306], to establish IPsec security associations.
      Confidentiality protection MUST be used to prevent an eavesdropper
      from gaining access to location information.  Confidentiality
      protection is already present for other reasons in many
      environments, such as for the transport of keying material in the
      context of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication
      and authorization.  Hence, this requirement is, in many
      environments, already fulfilled.  Mutual authentication MUST be
      provided between neighboring RADIUS entities to prevent man-in-
      the-middle attacks.  Since mutual authentication is already
      required for key transport within RADIUS messages, it does not
      represent a deployment obstacle.  Since IPsec protection is
      already suggested as a mechanism to protect RADIUS, no additional
      considerations need to be addressed beyond those described in
      [RFC3579].
   In case IPsec protection is not available for some reason and RADIUS-
   specific security mechanisms have to be used, then the following
   considerations apply.  The Access-Request message is not integrity
   protected.  This would allow an adversary to change the contents of
   the Location Object or to insert, modify, and delete attributes or
   individual fields.  To address these problems, the Message-
   Authenticator (80) can be used to integrity protect the entire<br>
   Access-Request packet.  The Message-Authenticator (80) is also<br>
   required when EAP is used and, hence, is supported by many modern
   RADIUS servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Access-Request packets including location attribute(s) without a

   the RADIUS server.  A RADIUS server supporting location attributes

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RADIUS and Diameter make some assumptions about the trust between
   traversed RADIUS entities in the sense that object-level security is
   not provided by either RADIUS or Diameter.  Hence, some trust has to
   be placed on the RADIUS entities to behave according to the defined
   rules.  Furthermore, the RADIUS protocol does not involve the user in
   their protocol interaction except for tunneling authentication
   information (such as EAP messages) through their infrastructure.
   RADIUS and Diameter have even become a de facto protocol for key
   distribution for network-access authentication applications.  Hence,
   in the past there were some concerns about the trust placed into the
   infrastructure -- particularly from the security area -- when it
   comes to keying.  The EAP keying infrastructure is described in
   [RFC4282].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   Privacy Considerations</h3></a>

   This section discusses privacy implications for the distribution of
   location information within RADIUS.  Note also that it is possible
   for the RADIUS server to obtain some amount of location information
   from the NAS identifier.  This document, however, describes
   procedures to convey more accurate location information about the end
   host and/or the network.  In a number of deployment environments,
   location information about the network also reveals the current
   location of the user with a certain degree of precision, depending on
   the location-determination mechanism used, the update frequency, the
   size of the network, and other factors, such as movement traces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Three types of use cases have to be differentiated:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The RADIUS server does not want to receive location information
      from the RADIUS client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  In case there is an out-of-band agreement between the entity
      responsible for the NAS and the entity operating the RADIUS
      server, location information may be sent without an explicit
      request from the RADIUS server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The RADIUS server dynamically requests location information from
      the NAS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.1"><h4>7.2.1   RADIUS Client</h4></a>

   The RADIUS client MUST behave according to the following guidelines:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If neither an out-of-band agreement exists nor location
      information is requested by the RADIUS server, then location
      information is not disclosed by the RADIUS client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The RADIUS client MUST pass location information to other entities
      (e.g., when information is written to a local database or to the
      log files) only together with the policy rules.  The entity
      receiving the location information (together with the policies)
      MUST follow the guidance given with these rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A RADIUS client MUST include Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and
      Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes that are configured
      within an Access-Request packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  NAS implementations supporting this specification, which are
      configured to provide location information, MUST echo Basic-
      Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules
      Attributes unmodified within a subsequent Access-Request packet.
      In addition, an Access-Request packet sent with a Service-Type
      value of "Authorize Only" MUST include the Basic-Location-Policy-
      Rules or Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes that were
      received in a previous Access-Accept if the FUTURE_REQUESTS flag
      was set in the Requested-Location-Info Attribute.
	<a name="section-7.2.2"><h4>7.2.2   RADIUS Server</h4></a>

   The RADIUS server is a natural place for storing authorization
   policies since the user typically has some sort of trust relationship
   with the entity operating the RADIUS server.  Once the infrastructure
   is deployed and location-aware applications are available, there
   might be a strong desire to use location information for other
   purposes as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Common Policy framework [RFC4745] that was extended for
      geolocation privacy [GEO-POLICY] is tailored for this purpose.
      The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
      (XCAP) [RFC4825] gives users the ability to change their privacy
      policies using a standardized protocol.  These policies are an
      important tool for limiting further distribution of the user's
      location to other location-based services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RADIUS server MUST behave according to the following guidelines:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The RADIUS server MUST attach available rules to the Access-
      Accept, Access-Reject, or Access-Challenge message when the RADIUS
      client is supposed to provide location information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  When location information is made available to other entities
      (e.g., writing to stable storage for later billing processing),
      then the RADIUS server MUST attach the privacy rules to location
      information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.3"><h4>7.2.3   RADIUS Proxy</h4></a>

   A RADIUS proxy, behaving as a combined RADIUS client and RADIUS
   server, MUST follow the rules described in Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3   Identity Information and Location Information</h3></a>

   For the envisioned usage scenarios, the identity of the user and his
   device is tightly coupled to the transfer of location information.
   If the identity can be determined by the visited network or RADIUS
   brokers, then it is possible to correlate location information with a
   particular user.  As such, it allows the visited network and brokers
   to learn the movement patterns of users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The user's identity can be "leaked" to the visited network or RADIUS
   brokers in a number of ways:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The user's device may employ a fixed Media Access Control (MAC)
      address or base its IP address on such an address.  This enables
      the correlation of the particular device to its different
      locations.  Techniques exist to avoid the use of an IP address
      that is based on a MAC address [RFC4941].  Some link layers make
      it possible to avoid MAC addresses or change them dynamically.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Network-access authentication procedures, such as the PPP
      Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) [RFC1994] or
      EAP [RFC4187], may reveal the user's identity as a part of the
      authentication procedure.  Techniques exist to avoid this problem
      in EAP methods, for instance by employing private Network Access
      Identifiers (NAIs) [RFC4282] in the EAP Identity Response message
      and by method-specific private identity exchanges in the EAP
      method (e.g., [RFC4187], [RFC5281], [PEAP], and [RFC5106]).
      Support for identity privacy within CHAP is not available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  RADIUS may return information from the home network to the visited
      one in a manner that makes it possible to either identify the user
      or at least correlate his session with other sessions, such as the
      use of static data in a Class Attribute [RFC2865] or in some
      accounting attribute usage scenarios [RFC4372].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Mobility protocols may reveal some long-term identifier, such as a
      home address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Application-layer protocols may reveal other permanent
      identifiers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To prevent the correlation of identities with location information,
   it is necessary to prevent leakage of identity information from all
   sources, not just one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unfortunately, most users are not educated about the importance of
   identity confidentiality, and some protocols lack support for
   identity-privacy mechanisms.  This problem is made worse by the fact
   that users may be unable to choose particular protocols, as the
   choice is often dictated by the type of network operator they use,
   the type of network they wish to access, the kind of equipment they
   have, or the type of authentication method they are using.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A scenario where the user is attached to the home network is, from a
   privacy point of view, simpler than a scenario where a user roams
   into a visited network, since the NAS and the home RADIUS server are
   in the same administrative domain.  No direct relationship between
   the visited and the home network operator may be available, and some
   RADIUS brokers need to be consulted.  With subscription-based network
   access as used today, the user has a contractual relationship with
   the home network provider that could (theoretically) allow higher
   privacy considerations to be applied (including policy rules stored
   at the home network itself, for the purpose of restricting further
   distribution).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In many cases it is necessary to secure the transport of location
   information along the RADIUS infrastructure.  Mechanisms to achieve
   this functionality are discussed in Section 7.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   The Attribute Types and Attribute Values defined in this document

   (IANA) from the RADIUS namespaces as described in the "IANA
   Considerations" section of RFC 3575 [RFC3575], in accordance with BCP
   26 [RFC5226].  Additionally, the Attribute Type has been registered

Appendix A.  Matching with GEOPRIV Requirements

   This section compares the requirements for a GEOPRIV using protocol,
   described in [RFC3693], against the approach of distributing Location
   Objects with RADIUS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In Appendices A.1 and A.2, we discuss privacy implications when
   RADIUS entities make location information available to other parties.
   In Appendix A.3, the requirements are matched against these two
   scenarios.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A.1.  Distribution of Location Information at the User's Home Network

   When location information is conveyed from the RADIUS client to the
   RADIUS server, then it might subsequently be made available for
   different purposes.  This section discusses the privacy implications
   for making location information available to other entities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To use a more generic scenario, we assume that the visited RADIUS and

             Figure 9: Location Server at the Visited Network

   Location information always travels with privacy policies.  This
   document enables the RADIUS client to obtain these policies.  The
   Location Server can subsequently act according to these policies to
   provide access control using the Extended-Location-Policy-Rules and
   to adhere to the privacy statements in the Basic-Location-Policy-
   Rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A.3.  Requirements Matching

   Section 7.1 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a "Location
   Object".  We discuss these requirements in the subsequent list.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.1, the syntax and semantics of the
         Location Object are taken from [RFC3825] and [RFC4776].  It is
         furthermore possible to convert it to the format used in the
         Geography Markup Language (GMLv3) [GMLv3], as used with PIDF-LO
         [RFC4119].
      *  Regarding requirement 1.2, a number of fields in the civic
         location-information format are optional.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.3, the inclusion of type of place item
         (CAtype 29) used in the DHCP civic format gives a further
         classification of the location.  This attribute can be seen as
         an extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.4, this document does not define the
         format of the location information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.5, location information is only sent
         from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both
         location information and privacy rules.  Location information
         is described in Sections 4.2, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2.  The
         corresponding privacy rules are detailed in Sections 4.4 and
         4.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.7, the Location Object is usable in a
         variety of protocols.  The format of the object is reused from
         other documents, as detailed in Sections 4.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2,
         4.4, and 4.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 1.8, the encoding of the Location Object
         has an emphasis on a lightweight encoding format to be used
         with RADIUS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 2.  (Location Object fields):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.1, the target identifier is carried
         within the network-access authentication protocol (e.g., within
         the EAP-Identity Response when EAP is used and/or within the
         EAP method itself).  As described in Section 7.2 of this
         document, it has a number of advantages if this identifier is
         not carried in clear.  This is possible with certain EAP
         methods whereby the identity in the EAP-Identity Response only
         contains information relevant for routing the response to the
         user's home network.  The user identity is protected by the
         authentication and key exchange protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.2, the Location Recipient is, in the
         main scenario, the home RADIUS server.  For a scenario where
         the Location Recipient is obtaining location information from
         the Location Server via HTTP or SIP, the respective mechanisms
         defined in these protocols are used to identify the recipient.
         The Location Generator cannot, a priori, know the recipients if
         they are not defined in this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.3, the credentials of the Location
         Recipient are known to the RADIUS entities based on the
         security mechanisms defined in the RADIUS protocol itself.
         Section 7 of this document describes these security mechanisms
         offered by the RADIUS protocol.  The same is true for
         requirement 2.4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.5, Sections 4.2, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2
         describe the content of the Location fields.  Since the
         location format itself is not defined in this document, motion
         and direction vectors as listed in requirement 2.6 are not
         defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.6, this document provides the
         capability for the RADIUS server to indicate what type of
         location information it would like to see from the RADIUS
         client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.7, timing information is provided with
         the 'Sighting Time' and 'Time-to-Live' fields defined in
         Section 4.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.8, a reference to an external (more
         detailed ruleset) is provided with the Extended-Location-
         Policy-Rules Attribute in Section 4.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.9, security headers and trailers are
         provided as part of the RADIUS protocol or even as part of
         IPsec.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 2.10, a version number in RADIUS is
         provided with the IANA registration of the attributes.  New
         attributes are assigned a new IANA number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 3.  (Location Data Types):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 3.1, this document reuses civic and
         geospatial location information as described in Sections 4.3.2
         and 4.3.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  With the support of civic and geospatial location information,
         support of requirement 3.2 is fulfilled.
      *  Regarding requirement 3.3, the geospatial location information
         used by this document only refers to absolute coordinates.
         However, the granularity of the location information can be
         reduced with the help of the AltRes, LoRes, and LaRes fields
         described in [RFC3825].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Regarding requirement 3.4, further Location Data Types can be
         added via new coordinate reference systems (CRSs -- see the
         Datum field in [RFC3825]) and via extensions to [RFC3825] and
         [RFC4776].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 7.2 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a "using
   protocol".  These requirements are listed below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 4.:  The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security
      instructions coded in the Location Object (LO) regarding the
      transmission and storage of the LO.  This document requires that
      entities that aim to make location information available to third
      parties be required to obey the privacy instructions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 5.:  The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys
      associated with the credentials are transported to the respective
      parties, that is, key establishment is the responsibility of the
      using protocol.  Section 7 of this document specifies how security
      mechanisms are used in RADIUS and how they can be reused to
      provide security protection for the Location Object.
      Additionally, the privacy considerations (see Section 7.2) are
      also relevant for this requirement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 6.  (Single Message Transfer):  In particular, for tracking of
      small target devices, the design should allow a single message/
      packet transmission of location as a complete transaction.  The
      encoding of the Location Object is specifically tailored towards
      the inclusion into a single message that even respects the (Path)
      MTU size.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 7.3 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a "Rule-based
   Location Data Transfer".  These requirements are listed below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 7.  (LS Rules):  With the scenario shown in Figure 8, the
      decision of a Location Server to provide a Location Recipient
      access to location information is based on Rule Maker-defined
      privacy rules that are stored at the home network.  With regard to
      the scenario shown in Figure 9, the Rule Maker-defined privacy
      rules are sent from the RADIUS server to the NAS (see Sections
      4.4, 4.5, and 7.2 for more details).
   Req. 8.  (LG Rules):  For all usage scenarios, it is possible to
      consider the privacy rule before transmitting location information
      from the NAS to the RADIUS server or even to third parties.  In
      the case of an out-of-band agreement between the owner of the NAS
      and the owner of the RADIUS server, privacy might be applied on a
      higher granularity.  For the scenario shown in Figure 8, the
      visited network is already in possession of the user's location
      information prior to the authentication and authorization of the
      user.  A correlation between the location and the user identity
      might, however, still not be possible for the visited network (as
      explained in Section 7.2).  A Location Server in the visited
      network has to evaluate available rulesets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 9.  (Viewer Rules):  The Rule Maker might define (via mechanisms
      outside the scope of this document) which policy rules are
      disclosed to other entities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 10.  (Full Rule language):  GEOPRIV has defined a rule language
      capable of expressing a wide range of privacy rules that is
      applicable in the area of the distribution of Location Objects.  A
      basic ruleset is provided with the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules
      Attribute (Section 4.4).  A reference to the extended ruleset is
      carried in Section 4.5.  The format of these rules is described in
      [RFC4745] and [GEO-POLICY].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 11.  (Limited Rule language):  A limited (or basic) ruleset is
      provided by the Policy-Information Attribute in Section 4.4 (and
      as introduced with PIDF-LO [RFC4119]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 7.4 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a "Location
   Object Privacy and Security".  These requirements are listed below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 12 (Identity Protection):  Support for unlinkable pseudonyms is
      provided by the usage of a corresponding authentication and key-
      exchange protocol.  Such protocols are available, for example,
      with the support of EAP as network-access authentication methods.
      Some EAP methods support passive user-identity confidentiality,
      whereas others even support active user-identity confidentiality.
      This issue is further discussed in Section 7.  The importance for
      user-identity confidentiality and identity protection has already
      been recognized as an important property (see, for example, a
      document on EAP method requirements for wireless LANs [RFC4017]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Req. 13.  (Credential Requirements):  As described in Section 7 ,
      RADIUS signaling messages can be protected with IPsec.  This
      allows a number of authentication and key exchange protocols to be
      used as part of IKE, IKEv2, or KINK.
   Req. 14.  (Security Features):  GEOPRIV defines a few security
      requirements for the protection of Location Objects, such as
      mutual end-point authentication, data object integrity, data
      object confidentiality, and replay protection.  As described in
      Section 7, these requirements are fulfilled with the usage of
      IPsec if mutual authentication refers to the RADIUS entities
      (acting as various GEOPRIV entities) that directly communicate
      with each other.

</p>   Req. 15.  (Minimal Crypto):  A minimum of security mechanisms are
      mandated by the usage of RADIUS.  Communication security for
      Location Objects between RADIUS infrastructure elements is
      provided by the RADIUS protocol (including IPsec and its dynamic
      key-management framework), rather than relying on object security
      via S/SIME (which is not available with RADIUS).
