    Sockets Application Program Interface (API) for Multihoming Shim

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document specifies sockets API extensions for the multihoming
   shim layer.  The API aims to enable interactions between applications
   and the multihoming shim layer for advanced locator management, and
   access to information about failure detection and path exploration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document is based on an assumption that a multihomed host is
   equipped with a conceptual sub-layer (hereafter called "shim sub-
   layer") inside the IP layer that maintains mappings between
   identifiers and locators.  Examples of the shim are Shim6 and the
   Host Identity Protocol (HIP).

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document defines sockets API extensions by which upper-layer
   protocols may be informed about and control the way in which a
   multihoming shim sub-layer in the IP layer manages the dynamic choice
   of locators.  Initially, the multihoming shim sub-layer refers to
   Shim6 and/or HIP, but it is defined generically.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The role of the multihoming shim sub-layer (hereafter called "shim
   sub-layer" in this document) is to avoid impacts to upper-layer
   protocols that may be caused when the endhost changes its attachment
   point to the Internet -- for instance, in the case of a rehoming
   event under the multihomed environment.  There is, however, a need
   for an API in the cases where 1) the upper-layer protocol is
   particularly sensitive to impacts, or 2) the upper-layer protocol
   wants to benefit from better knowledge of what is going on
   underneath.
   There are various kinds of technologies that aim to solve the same
   issue (the multihoming issue).  Note that there will be conflict when
   more than one shim sub-layer is active at the same time.  The
   assumption made in this document is that there is only a single shim
   sub-layer (HIP or Shim6) activated on the system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The target readers of this document are application programmers who
   develop application software that may benefit greatly from multihomed
   environments.  In addition, this document aims to provide necessary
   information for developers of shim protocols to implement APIs for
   enabling advanced locator management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Requirements Language</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Terminology and Background</h2></a>

   This section provides terminology used in this document.  Basically,
   most of the terms used in this document are taken from the following
   documents:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Shim6 Protocol Specification [RFC5533]

   o  HIP Architecture [RFC4423]

   o  Reachability Protocol (REAP) [RFC5534]

   In this document, the term "IP" refers to both IPv4 and IPv6, unless
   the protocol version is specifically mentioned.  The following are
   definitions of terms frequently used in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Endpoint Identifier (EID) -- The identifier used by the
      application to specify the endpoint of a given communication.
      Applications may handle EIDs in various ways, such as long-lived
      connections, callbacks, and referrals [SHIM6-APP-REFER].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  In the case of Shim6, an identifier called a ULID (Upper-Layer
         Identifier) serves as an EID.  A ULID is chosen from locators
         available on the host.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  In the case of HIP, an identifier called a Host Identifier
         serves as an EID.  A Host Identifier is derived from the public
         key of a given host.  For the sake of backward compatibility
         with the sockets API, the Host Identifier is represented in the
         form of a hash of a public key.
      *  Note that the EID appears in the standard sockets API as an
         address, and does not appear in the extensions defined in this
         document, which only concern locators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Locator - The IP address actually used to deliver IP packets.
      Locators are present in the source and destination fields of the
      IP header of a packet on the wire.  A locator as discussed in this
      document could be either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.  Note
      that HIP can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 locators, whereas Shim6 can
      handle only IPv6 locators.  For the HIP case, a locator can be a
      private IPv4 address when the host is behind a NAT.  Section 8.1.1
      gives a detailed description about the handling of a locator
      behind a NAT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  List of locators - A list of locators associated with an EID.
         There are two lists of locators stored in a given context.  One
         is associated with the local EID, and the other is associated
         with the remote EID.  As defined in [RFC5533], the list of
         locators associated with an EID 'A' is denoted as Ls(A).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Preferred locator - The (source/destination) locator currently
         used to send packets within a given context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Unknown locator - Any locator that does not appear in the
         locator list of the shim context associated with the socket.
         When there is no shim context associated with the socket, any
         source and/or destination locator requested by the application
         is considered to be an unknown locator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Valid locator - A valid locator means that the locator is
         considered to be valid in the security sense.  More
         specifically, the validity indicates whether the locator is
         part of a Hash-Based Address (HBA) set [RFC5535].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Verified locator - A verified locator means that the locator is
         considered to be reachable according to the result of a REAP
         return routability check.  Note that the verification applies
         only to the peer's locator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Shim - The conceptual sub-layer inside the IP layer.  This sub-
      layer maintains mappings between EIDs and locators.  An EID can be
      associated with more than one locator at a time when the host is
      multihomed.  The term "shim" does not refer to a specific protocol
      but refers to the conceptual sub-layer inside the IP layer.
   o  Identifier/locator adaptation - The adaptation performed at the
      shim sub-layer.  This adaptation may end up re-writing the source
      and/or destination addresses of an IP packet.  In the outbound
      packet processing, the EID pair is converted to the associated
      locator pair.  In the inbound packet processing, the locator pair
      is converted to the EID pair.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Context - The state information shared by a given pair of peers.
      Context stores a binding between the EID and associated locators.
      Contexts are maintained by the shim sub-layer.  Deferred context
      setup is a scenario where a context is established after the
      communication starts.  Deferred context setup is possible if the
      ULID is routable, such as in the case of Shim6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reachability detection - The procedure to check reachability
      between a given locator pair.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Path - The sequence of routers that an IP packet goes through to
      reach the destination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Path exploration - The procedure to explore available paths for a
      given set of locator pairs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Outage - The incident that prevents IP packets flowing from the
      source locator to the destination locator.  When there is an
      outage, it means that there is no reachability between a given
      locator pair.  The outage may be caused by various reasons, such
      as a shortage of network resources, congestion, and human error
      (faulty operation).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Working address pair - Considered to be "working" if the packet
      can safely travel from the source to the destination, where the
      packet contains the first address from the pair as the source
      address and the second address from the pair as the destination
      address.  If reachability is confirmed in both directions, the
      address pair is considered to be working bi-directionally.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Reachability Protocol (REAP) - The protocol for detecting failure
      and exploring reachability in a multihomed environment.  REAP is
      defined in [RFC5534].
   In this document, syntax and semantics of the API are given in the
   same way as in the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)
   standard [POSIX].  The API specifies how to use ancillary data (aka
   cmsg) to access the locator information with recvmsg() and/or
   sendmsg() I/O calls.  The API is described in C language, and data
   types are defined in the POSIX format; intN_t means a signed integer
   of exactly N bits (e.g., int16_t), and uintN_t means an unsigned
   integer of exactly N bits (e.g., uint32_t).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The distinction between "connected" sockets and "unconnected" sockets
   is important when discussing the applicability of the sockets API
   defined in this document.  A connected socket is bound to a given
   peer, whereas an unconnected socket is not bound to any specific
   peers.  A TCP socket becomes a connected socket when the TCP
   connection establishment is completed.  UDP sockets are unconnected,
   unless the application uses the connect() system call.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   System Overview</h2></a>

   Figure 1 illustrates the system overview.  The shim sub-layer and
   REAP component exist inside the IP layer.  Applications use the
   sockets API defined in this document to interface with the shim
   sub-layer and the transport layer for locator management, failure
   detection, and path exploration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is also possible that the shim sub-layer interacts with the
   transport layer; however, such an interaction is outside the scope of
   this document.<pre>

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Requirements</h2></a>

   The following is a list of requirements from applications:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Turn on/off shim.  An application should be able to request to
      turn on or turn off the multihoming support by the shim layer:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Apply shim.  The application should be able to explicitly
         request that the shim sub-layer apply multihoming support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Don't apply shim.  The application should be able to request
         that the shim sub-layer not apply the multihoming support but
         apply normal IP processing at the IP layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Note that this function is also required by other types of
         multihoming mechanisms, such as the Stream Control Transmission
         Protocol (SCTP) and multipath TCP, to avoid potential conflict
         with the shim sub-layer.
   o  Locator management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  It should be possible to set a preferred source and/or
         destination locator within a given context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  It should be possible to get a preferred source and/or
         destination locator within a given context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  It should be possible to set a list of source and/or
         destination locators within a given context: Ls(local) and
         Ls(remote).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  It should be possible to get a list of source and/or
         destination locators within a given context: Ls(local) and
         Ls(remote).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Notification from applications and upper-layer protocols to the
      shim sub-layer about the status of the communication.  The
      notification occurs in an event-based manner.  Applications and/or
      upper-layer protocols may provide positive feedback or negative
      feedback to the shim sub-layer.  Note that these types of feedback
      are mentioned in [RFC5534]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Applications and/or upper-layer protocols (e.g., TCP) may
         provide positive feedback to the shim sub-layer informing that
         the communication is going well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  Applications and/or upper-layer protocols (e.g., TCP) may
         provide negative feedback to the shim sub-layer informing that
         the communication status is not satisfactory.  TCP may detect a
         problem when it does not receive any expected ACK message from
         the peer.  The REAP module may be triggered by the negative
         feedback and invoke the path exploration procedure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Feedback from applications to the shim sub-layer.  Applications
      should be able to inform the shim sub-layer of the timeout values
      for detecting failures, sending keepalives, and starting the
      exploration procedure.  In particular, applications should be able
      to suppress keepalives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Hot-standby.  Applications may request the shim sub-layer for a
      hot-standby capability.  This means that alternative paths are
      known to be working in advance of a failure detection.  In such a
      case, it is possible for the shim sub-layer to immediately replace
      the current locator pair with an alternative locator pair.
   o  Eagerness for locator exploration.  An application should be able
      to inform the shim sub-layer of how aggressively it wants the REAP
      mechanism to perform a path exploration (e.g., by specifying the
      number of concurrent attempts of discovery of working locator
      pairs) when an outage occurs on the path between the locator pair
      in use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Providing locator information to applications.  An application
      should be able to obtain information about the locator pair that
      was actually used to send or receive packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      *  For inbound traffic, the application may be interested in the
         locator pair that was actually used to receive the packet.

   In this section, socket options that are specific to the shim
   sub-layer are defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Table 1 shows a list of the socket options that are specific to the
   shim sub-layer.  All of these socket options are defined at the level
   SOL_SHIM.  When an application uses one of the socket options by
   getsockopt() or setsockopt(), the second argument MUST be set to
   SOL_SHIM.
   The first column of Table 1 gives the name of the option.  The second
   column indicates whether the value for the socket option can be read
   by getsockopt(), and the third column indicates whether the value for
   the socket option can be written by setsockopt().  The fourth column
   provides a brief description of the socket option.  The fifth column
   shows the type of data structure specified along with the socket
   option.  By default, the data structure type is an integer.

   mentioned, all the shim-specific socket options are defined at the
   SOL_SHIM level.  This design choice brings the following advantages:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The existing sockets APIs continue to work at the layer above the

       application obtains additional control of locator management.
   3.  The shim-specific socket options can be kept independent from

       protocol (IPPROTO_TCP or IPPROTO_UDP) settings.

   The SHIM_ASSOCIATED option is used to check whether or not the socket
   is associated with any shim context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This option is meaningful when the locator information of the
   received IP packet does not tell whether or not the identifier/
   locator adaptation is performed.  Note that the EID pair and the
   locator pair may be identical in some cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the socket option is read-only, and the option value can be
   read by getsockopt().  The result (0/1/2) is set in the option value
   (the fourth argument of getsockopt()).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the application specifies the socket option to an unconnected
   socket, error code EOPNOTSUPP is returned to the application.
   The data type of the option value is an integer.  The option value
   indicates the presence of shim context.  A return value of 1 means
   that the socket is associated with a shim context at the shim

   It is assumed that the kernel is capable of maintaining the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Relation to Existing Sockets API Extensions</h2></a>

   This section explains the relation between the sockets API defined in
   this document and the existing sockets API extensions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As mentioned in Section 6, the basic assumption is that the existing
   sockets API continues to work above the shim sub-layer.  This means
   that the existing sockets API deals with identifiers, and the sockets
   API defined in this document deals with locators.
   SHIM_LOC_LOCAL_SEND and SHIM_LOC_PEER_SEND socket options are
   semantically similar to the IPV6_PKTINFO sockets API in the sense
   that both provide a means for an application to set the source IP
   address of outbound IP packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   Operational Considerations</h2></a>

   This section gives operational considerations of the sockets API
   defined in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.1"><h3>11.1   Conflict Resolution</h3></a>

   There can be a conflicting situation when different applications
   specify different preferences for the same shim context.  For
   instance, suppose that applications A and B establish communication
   with the same EID pair while both applications have different
   preferences in their choice of local locator.  The notion of context
   forking in Shim6 can resolve the conflicting situation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible that socket options defined in Section 6 cause a
   conflicting situation when the target context is shared by multiple
   applications.  In such a case, the socket handler should inform the
   shim sub-layer that context forking is required.  In Shim6, when a
   context is forked, a unique identifier called the Forked Instance
   Identifier (FII) is assigned to the newly forked context.  The forked
   context is then exclusively associated with the socket through which
   a non-default preference value was specified.  The forked context is
   maintained by the shim sub-layer during the lifetime of the
   associated socket instance.  When the socket is closed, the shim
   sub-layer SHOULD delete the associated context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the application specifies SHIM_LOC_*_SEND specifying a different
   source or destination locator that does not have the highest priority
   and weight specified by the SHIM_LOC_*_PREF, the shim sub-layer
   SHOULD supersede the request made by SHIM_LOC_*_SEND over the
   preference specified by SHIM_LOC_*_PREF.
   When the peer provides preferences of the locators (e.g., a Shim6
   peer sends a locator with a Locator Preferences Option) that conflict
   with preferences specified by the applications either by
   SHIM_LOC_PEER_SEND or SHIM_LOC_PEER_PREF, the shim sub-layer SHOULD
   supersede the preferences made by the applications over the
   preferences specified by the peer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.2"><h3>11.2   Incompatibility between IPv4 and IPv6</h3></a>

   The shim sub-layer performs identifier/locator adaptation.
   Therefore, in some cases, the whole IP header can be replaced with a
   new IP header of a different address family (e.g., conversion from
   IPv4 to IPv6 or vice versa).  Hence, there is an issue regarding how
   to make the conversion with minimum impact.  Note that this issue is
   common in other protocol conversion techniques [RFC2765] [RFC6145].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As studied in the previous works on protocol conversion [RFC2765],
   [RFC6145] some of the features (IPv6 routing headers, hop-by-hop
   extension headers, and destination headers) from IPv6 are not
   convertible to IPv4.  In addition, the notion of source routing is
   not exactly the same in IPv4 and IPv6.  This means that an error may
   occur during the conversion of the identifier and locator.  It is
   outside the scope of this document to describe how the shim sub-layer
   should behave in such erroneous cases.

   ancillary data, and the socket level (SOL_SHIM) that are defined in
   this document.  All the numbers concerned are not under the control
   of the IETF or IANA, but they are platform-specific.

   This section gives security considerations of the API defined in this

	<a name="section-14.1"><h3>14.1   Treatment of Unknown Locator</h3></a>

   When sending IP packets, there is a possibility that an application
   will request the use of an unknown locator for the source and/or
   destination locators.  Note that the treatment of an unknown locator
   can be a subject of security considerations, because the use of an
   invalid source and/or destination locator may cause a redirection
   attack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-14.1.1"><h4>14.1.1   Treatment of Unknown Source Locator</h4></a>

   The shim sub-layer checks to determine if the requested locator is
   available on any local interface.  If not, the shim sub-layer MUST
   reject the request and return an error message with the
   EINVALIDLOCATOR code to the application.  If the locator is confirmed
   to be available, the shim sub-layer SHOULD initiate the procedure to
   update the locator list.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of the following socket options and ancillary data requires
   treatment of an unknown source locator:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  SHIM_LOC_LOCAL_SEND

   o  SHIM_LOC_LOCAL_PREF

   o  SHIM_LOCLIST_LOCAL

	<a name="section-14.1.2"><h4>14.1.2   Treatment of Unknown Destination Locator</h4></a>

   If the shim sub-layer turns out to be Shim6, the Shim6 layer MUST
   reject the request for using an unknown destination locator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the shim sub-layer turns out to be HIP, the HIP layer MUST reject
   the request for using an unknown destination locator.  There is,
   however, an exceptional case where the HIP layer SHOULD accept the
   request, provided that the HIP association is in the UNASSOCIATED
   state.  Details of locator handling in HIP are described in
   Section 4.6 of [RFC6317].

Appendix A.  Context Forking

   In this section, an issue concerning context forking and its relation
   to the multihoming shim API are discussed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Shim6 supports the notion of context forking.  A peer may decide to
   fork a context for a certain reason (e.g., an upper-layer protocol
   prefers to use a different locator pair than the one defined in an
   available context).  The procedure of context forking is done
   similarly to the normal context establishment, performing the 4-way
   message exchange.  A peer who has decided to fork a context initiates
   the context establishment.  Hereafter, we call this peer the
   "initiator".  The peer of the initiator is called the "responder".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Once the forked context is established between the peers, on the
   initiator side, it is possible to apply forked context to the packet
   flow, since the system maintains an association between the forked
   context and the socket owned by the application that has requested
   the context forking.  How this association is maintained is an
   implementation-specific issue.  However, on the responder side, there
   is a question of how the outbound packet can be multiplexed by the
   shim sub-layer, because there is more than one Shim6 context that
   matches with the ULID pair of the packet flow.  There is a need to
   differentiate packet flows not only by the ULID pairs but by some
   other information and associate a given packet flow with a specific
   context.

</p>   Figure 8 gives an example of a scenario where two communicating peers
   fork a context.  Initially, there has been a single transaction
   between the peers, by the application 1 (App1).  Accordingly, another
   transaction is started, by application 2 (App2).  Both of the
   transactions are made based on the same ULID pair.  The first context
   pair (Ctx1) is established for the transaction of App1.  Given the
   requests from App2, the shim sub-layer on Peer 1 decides to fork a
   context.  Accordingly, a forked context (Ctx2) is established between
   the peers, which should be exclusively applied to the transaction of
   App2.  Ideally, multiplexing and demultiplexing of packet flows that
   relate to App1 and App2 should be done as illustrated in Figure 8.
   However, as mentioned earlier, the responder needs to multiplex
   outbound flows of App1 and App2 somehow.  Note that if a context
   forking occurs on the initiator side, a context forking needs to also
   occur on the responder side.
