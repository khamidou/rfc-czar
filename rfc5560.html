   When a packet is sent from one host to the other, one normally
   expects that exactly one copy of the packet that was sent arrives at
   the destination.  It is, however, possible that a packet is either
   lost or that multiple copies arrive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In earlier work, a metric for packet loss was defined.  This metric
   quantifies the case where a packet that is sent does not arrive at
   its destination within a reasonable time.  In this memo, a metric for
   another case is defined: a packet is sent, but multiple copies
   arrive.  The document also discusses streams and methods to summarize
   the results of streams.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document defines a metric for one-way packet duplication across
   Internet paths.  It builds on the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
   Framework document [RFC2330]; the reader is assumed to be familiar
   with that document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document follows the same structure as the document for one-way
   packet loss [RFC2680]; the reader is assumed to be familiar with that
   document as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The structure of this memo is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  First, a singleton metric, called Type-P-one-way-packet-arrival-
      count, is introduced to measure the number of arriving packets for
      each packet sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Then, a singleton metric, called Type-P-one-way-packet-
      duplication, is defined to describe a single instance of packet
      duplication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Next, this singleton metric is used to define samples, Type-P-one-
      way-Packet-Duplication-Poisson-Stream and Type-P-one-way-Packet-
      Duplication-Periodic-Stream.  These are introduced to measure
      duplication in a series of packets sent with either Poisson-
      distributed [RFC2680] or periodic [RFC3432] intervals between the
      packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Finally, statistics that summarize the properties of these samples
      are introduced.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Notation</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although RFC 2119 was written with protocols in mind, the key words
   are used in this document for similar reasons.  They are used to
   ensure the results of measurements from two different implementations
   are comparable and to note instances when an implementation could
   perturb the network.
	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Motivation</h3></a>

   When a packet is sent from one host to the other, one normally
   expects that exactly one copy of the packet that was sent arrives at
   the destination.  It is, however, possible that a packet is either
   lost or that multiple copies arrive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In earlier work, a metric for packet loss was defined [RFC2680].
   This metric distinguishes between cases where the packet arrives and
   where the packet does not arrive within a reasonable time.  In this
   memo, a metric for a third outcome is defined: a single packet is
   sent, but multiple copies arrive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As this document describes a case similar to the one discussed in
   [RFC2680], all considerations from that document on timing and
   accuracy apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   A Singleton Definition for One-Way Packet Arrival Count</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Metric Name</h3></a>

   Type-P-one-way-packet-arrival-count

	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Metrics Parameters</h3></a>

   o  src, the IP address of a host

   o  dst, the IP address of a host

   o  T, the wire time of a packet at the source

   o  T0, the maximum waiting time for a packet to arrive at the
      destination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Metric Units</h3></a>

   An integer number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Definition</h3></a>

   Two packets are considered identical if and only if:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Both contain identical information fields (see Section 2.5).  The
      recipient thus could take either packet and use the data in an
      application.  The other packet does not contain any additional
      information.
   o  Both packets appear to have been sent by one and the same host, to
      one and the same destination.  Hosts are identified by their IP
      addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The value of a Type-P-one-way-packet-arrival-count is a positive
   integer number indicating the number of (uncorrupted and identical)
   copies received by dst in the interval [T, T+T0] for a packet sent by
   src at time T.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a packet is sent, but it is lost or does not arrive in the
   interval [T, T+T0], then the metric is undefined.  Applications MAY
   report an "impossible" value (for example, -1) to indicate this
   condition instead of undefined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a packet is fragmented during transport and if, for whatever
   reason, reassembly does not occur, then the packet will be deemed
   lost.  It is thus not included in the Type-P-one-way-packet-arrival-
   count.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5"><h3>2.5   Discussion</h3></a>

   This metric counts the number of packets arriving for each packet
   sent.  The time-out value T0 SHOULD be set to a value when the
   application could potentially still use the packet and would not
   discard it automatically.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If this metric is used in parallel with the Packet Loss Metric
   [RFC2680], the value of T0 MUST be the same for both cases in order
   to keep the results comparable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The metric only counts packets that are not corrupted during
   transmission and may have been resent automatically by lower layers
   or intermediate devices.  Packets that were corrupted during
   transmission but, nevertheless, still arrived at dst are not counted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Clocks do have to be synchronized between src and dst such that it is
   possible to uniquely and accurately determine the interval [T, T+T0]
   at both sides.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If this metric is used in an active measurement system, the system
   MUST NOT send multiple packets with identical information fields in
   order to avoid that all packets will be declared duplicates.  This
   metric can be used inside a passive measurement system as well, using
   packets generated by another source.  However, if the source can send
   two identical packets within the interval [T, T+T0], this will be
   incorrectly labeled as a duplicate, resulting in a false positive.
   It is up to the implementor to estimate if this scenario is likely to
   happen and the rate of false positives that is acceptable.
   The definition of identical information fields is such that two
   packets are considered to be identical if they are sent from the same
   source and contain the same information.  This does not necessarily
   mean that all bits in the packet are the same.  For example, when a
   packet is replicated and the copies are transferred along different
   paths, the Time to Live (TTL) may be different.  The implementation
   MUST specify which fields are compared when deciding whether or not
   two packets are identical.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the case of IPv4, these will usually be: version, ihl,
   identification, src, dst, protocol, some or all upper-layer protocol
   data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In IPv6, these will usually be: version, next header, source,
   destination, some or all upper-layer protocol data

   Note that the use of the identification field is not present in non-
   fragmented IPv6 packets and may not be sufficient to distinguish
   packets from each even in IPv4, particularly at higher transmission
   speeds

	<a name="section-2.6"><h3>2.6   Methodology</h3></a>

   The basic technique to measure this metric follows the methodology
   described in Section 2.6 of [RFC2680] with one exception.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC2680] does not specify that the receiving host should be able to
   receive multiple copies of a single packet, as it only needs one copy
   to determine the metrics.  Implementations for this metric should
   obviously be capable of receiving multiple copies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.7"><h3>2.7   Errors and Uncertainties</h3></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Metric Name</h3></a>

   Type-P-one-way-packet-duplication
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Metrics Parameters</h3></a>

   o  src, the IP address of a host

   o  dst, the IP address of a host

   o  T, the wire time of a packet at the source

   o  T0, the maximum waiting time for a packet to arrive at the
      destination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Metric Units</h3></a>

   An integer number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Definition</h3></a>

   The value of a Type-P-one-way-packet-duplication is a positive
   integer number indicating the number of (uncorrupted and identical)
   additional copies of an individual packet received by dst in the
   interval [T, T+T0] as sent by src at time T.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a packet is sent and only one copy arrives in the interval [T,
   T+T0], then the metric is 0.  If no copy arrives in this interval,
   then the metric is undefined.  Applications MAY report an
   "impossible" value (for example, -1) to indicate this condition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5   Discussion</h3></a>

   This metric is equal to:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Type-P-one-way-packet-arrival-count - 1

   This metric is expected to be used for applications that need to know
   duplication for an individual packet.  All considerations regarding
   methodology, errors, and reporting from the previous section apply.

   Consider a stream of 4 packets, sent as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        (1, 2, 3, 4)

   and arriving as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Case 1: (1, 2, 3, 4)

   o  Case 2: (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)

   o  Case 3: (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)

   o  Case 4: (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4)

   Case 1: No packets are duplicated in a stream, and both the Type-P-
   one-way-packet-duplication-fraction and the Type-P-one-way-packet-
   replicated-packet-rate are 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Case 2: Every packet is duplicated once, and the Type-P-one-way-
   packet-duplication-fraction is 100%.  The Type-P-one-way-replicated-
   packet-rate is 100%, too.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Case 3: Every packet is duplicated twice, so the Type-P-one-way-

   packet-rate is still 100%.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Case 4: Half the packets are duplicated twice and the other half are
   not duplicated.  The Type-P-one-way-packet-duplication-fraction is
   again 100%, and this number does not show the difference with case 2.
   However, the Type-P-one-way-packet-replicated-packet-rate is 50% in
   this case and 100% in case 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, the Type-P-one-way-packet-duplication-rate will not show the

   Type-P-one-way-packet-duplication-fraction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, note that the order in which the packets arrived does not
   affect the results.  For example, these variations of case 2:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Case 2a: (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)

   o  Case 2b: (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4)

   o  Case 2c: (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)

   Type-P-one-way-packet-duplication-fraction and the Type-P-one-way-

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy
   concerns.  This memo does not specify an implementation of the
   metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet
   nor of applications that run on the Internet.  However,
   implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and
   privacy concerns.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
   the measurements and potential harm to the measurements.  The
   measurements could cause harm because they are active, and they
   inject packets into the network.  The measurement parameters MUST be
   carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of
   additional traffic into the networks they measure.  If they inject
   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and
   in extreme cases, cause congestion and denial of service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic or by
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss
   rate will be artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the
   probability that measurement traffic can be distinguished from
   "normal" traffic.  Authentication techniques, such as digital
   signatures, may be used where appropriate to guard against injected
   traffic attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The privacy concerns of network measurement are limited by the active
   measurements described in this memo.  Unlike passive measurements,
   there can be no release of existing user data.
