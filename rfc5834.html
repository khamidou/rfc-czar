   The CAPWAP protocol [RFC5415] defines a standard, interoperable
   protocol, which enables an Access Controller (AC) to manage a
   collection of Wireless Termination Points (WTPs).  CAPWAP supports
   the use of various wireless technologies by the WTPs, with one
   specified in the CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11 [RFC5416].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a MIB module that can be used to manage CAPWAP
   implementations for IEEE 802.11 wireless binding.  This MIB module
   covers both configuration for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and
   a way to reuse the IEEE 802.11 MIB module [IEEE.802-11.2007].  It is
   presented as a basis for future work on the SNMP management of the
   CAPWAP protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h2></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Terminology</h2></a>

   This document uses terminology from the CAPWAP protocol specification
   [RFC5415], the CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11 [RFC5416], and
   the CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB [RFC5833].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Access Controller (AC): The network entity that provides WTP access
   to the network infrastructure in the data plane, control plane,
   management plane, or a combination therein.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Wireless Termination Point (WTP): The physical or network entity that
   contains an RF antenna and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit
   and receive station traffic for wireless access networks.
   Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP): It is a
   generic protocol defining AC and WTP control and data plane
   communication via a CAPWAP protocol transport mechanism.  CAPWAP
   control messages, and optionally CAPWAP data messages, are secured
   using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4347].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CAPWAP Control Channel: A bi-directional flow defined by the AC IP
   Address, WTP IP Address, AC control port, WTP control port, and the
   transport-layer protocol (UDP or UDP-Lite) over which CAPWAP control
   packets are sent and received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CAPWAP Data Channel: A bi-directional flow defined by the AC IP
   Address, WTP IP Address, AC data port, WTP data port, and the
   transport-layer protocol (UDP or UDP-Lite) over which CAPWAP data
   packets are sent and received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Station (STA): A device that contains an interface to a wireless
   medium (WM).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Split and Local MAC: The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of
   operation: Split and Local MAC (medium access control).  In Split MAC
   mode, all Layer 2 wireless data and management frames are
   encapsulated via the CAPWAP protocol and exchanged between the AC and
   the WTPs.  The Local MAC mode of operation allows the data frames to
   be either locally bridged or tunneled as 802.3 frames.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Wireless Binding: The CAPWAP protocol is independent of a specific
   WTP radio technology, as well its associated wireless link layer
   protocol.  Elements of the CAPWAP protocol are designed to
   accommodate the specific needs of each wireless technology in a
   standard way.  Implementation of the CAPWAP protocol for a particular
   wireless technology MUST define a binding protocol for it, e.g., the
   binding for IEEE 802.11, provided in [RFC5416].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): A WLAN refers to a logical
   component instantiated on a WTP device.  A single physical WTP MAY
   operate a number of WLANs.  Each Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)
   and its constituent wireless terminal radios are denoted as a
   distinct WLAN on a physical WTP.  To support a physical WTP with
   multiple WLANs is an important feature for CAPWAP protocol's 802.11
   binding, and it is also for MIB module design.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Wireless Binding MIB Module: Other Standards Development
   Organizations (SDOs), such as IEEE, already defined MIB modules for
   specific wireless technologies, e.g., the IEEE 802.11 MIB module
   [IEEE.802-11.2007].  Such MIB modules are called wireless binding MIB
   modules.
   CAPWAP Protocol Wireless Binding MIB Module: It is a MIB module
   corresponding to the CAPWAP Protocol Binding for a wireless binding.
   Sometimes, not all the technology-specific message elements in a
   CAPWAP binding protocol have MIB objects defined by other SDOs.  For
   example, the protocol of [RFC5416] defines WLAN conception.  Also,
   Local or Split MAC modes could be specified for a WLAN.  The MAC mode
   for a WLAN is not in the scope of IEEE 802.11 [IEEE.802-11.2007].  In
   such cases, in addition to the existing wireless binding MIB modules
   defined by other SDOs, a CAPWAP protocol wireless binding MIB module
   is required to be defined for a wireless binding.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   WLAN Profile</h3></a>

   A WLAN profile stores configuration parameters such as MAC type and
   tunnel mode for a WLAN.  Each WLAN profile is identified by a profile
   identifier.  The operator needs to create WLAN profiles before WTPs
   connect to the AC.  To provide WLAN service, the operator SHOULD bind
   WLAN profiles to a WTP Virtual Radio Interface that corresponds to a
   PHY radio.  During the binding operation, the AC MUST select an
   unused WLAN ID between 1 and 16 [RFC5416].  For example, to bind one
   more WLAN profile to a radio that has been bound with a WLAN profile,
   the AC SHOULD allocate WLAN ID 2 to the radio.  Although the maximum
   value of a WLAN ID is 16, the operator could configure more than 16
   WLAN Profiles on the AC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Requirements and Constraints</h3></a>

   The IEEE 802.11 MIB module [IEEE.802-11.2007] already defines MIB
   objects for most IEEE 802.11 Message Elements in the CAPWAP Protocol
   Binding for IEEE 802.11 [RFC5416].  As a CAPWAP protocol 802.11
   binding MIB module, the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module MUST be able to reuse
   such MIB objects in the IEEE 802.11 MIB module and support functions
   (such as MAC mode for WLAN in the [RFC5416]) that are not in the
   scope of IEEE 802.11 standard.  The CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module MUST
   support such functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In summary, the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module needs to support:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - Reuse of wireless binding MIB modules in the IEEE 802.11 standard;
   - Centralized management and configuration of WLAN profiles on the
     AC;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - Configuration of a MAC type and tunnel mode for a specific WLAN
     profile.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Mechanism of Reusing Wireless Binding MIB Module</h3></a>

   In the IEEE 802.11 MIB module, the MIB tables such as
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable are able to support WLAN
   configuration (such as authentication algorithm), and these tables
   use the ifIndex as the index which works well in the autonomous WLAN
   architecture.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reuse of such wireless binding MIB modules is very important to
   centralized WLAN architectures.  The key point is to abstract a WLAN
   profile as a WLAN Profile Interface on the AC, which could be
   identified by an ifIndex.  The MIB objects in the IEEE 802.11 MIB
   module which are associated with this interface can be used to
   configure WLAN parameters for the WLAN, such as authentication
   algorithm.  With the ifIndex of a WLAN Profile Interface, the AC is
   able to reuse the IEEE 802.11 MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module, each PHY radio is identified by a WTP
   ID and a radio ID, and has a corresponding WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface on the AC.  The IEEE 802.11 MIB module associated with this
   interface can be used to configure IEEE 802.11 wireless binding
   parameters for the radio such as RTS Threshold.  A WLAN Basic Service
   Set (BSS) Interface, created by binding a WLAN to a WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface, is used for data forwarding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Structure of MIB Module</h2></a>

   The MIB objects are derived from the CAPWAP protocol binding for IEEE
   802.11 document [RFC5416].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      capwapDot11WlanTable

      The table allows the operator to display and configure WLAN
      profiles, such as specifying the MAC type and tunnel mode for a
      WLAN.  Also, it helps the AC to configure a WLAN through the IEEE
      802.11 MIB module.
      capwapDot11WlanBindTable

      The table provides a way to bind WLAN profiles to a WTP Virtual
      Radio Interface, which has a corresponding PHY radio.  A binding
      operation dynamically creates a WLAN BSS Interface, which is used
      for data forwarding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Relationship to Other MIB Modules</h2></a>

	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   Relationship to SNMPv2-MIB Module</h3></a>

   The CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module does not duplicate the objects of the
   'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] that is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   Relationship to IF-MIB Module</h3></a>

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing WLAN that are modeled
   as interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each WLAN profile corresponds to a WLAN Profile Interface on the AC.
   The interface MUST be modeled as an ifEntry, and ifEntry objects such
   as ifIndex, ifDescr, ifName, and ifAlias are to be used as per
   [RFC2863].  The WLAN Profile Interface provides a way to configure
   IEEE 802.11 parameters for a specific WLAN and reuse the IEEE 802.11
   MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To provide data forwarding service, the AC dynamically creates WLAN
   BSS Interfaces.  A WLAN BSS Interface MUST be modeled as an ifEntry,
   and ifEntry objects such as ifIndex, ifDescr, ifName, and ifAlias are
   to be used as per [RFC2863].  The interface enables a single physical
   WTP to support multiple WLANs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also, the AC MUST have a mechanism that preserves the value of the
   ifIndexes (of both the WLAN Profile Interfaces and the WLAN BSS
   Interfaces) in the ifTable at AC reboot.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3   Relationship to CAPWAP-BASE-MIB Module</h3></a>

   The CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module provides a way to manage and control WTP
   and radio objects.  Especially, it provides the WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface mechanism to enable the AC to reuse the IEEE 802.11 MIB
   module.  With this mechanism, an operator could configure an IEEE
   802.11 radio's parameters and view the radio's traffic statistics on
   the AC.  Based on the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module, the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB
   module provides more WLAN information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.4"><h3>7.4   Relationship to MIB Module in the IEEE 802.11 Standard</h3></a>

   With the ifIndex of WLAN Profile Interface and WLAN BSS Interface,
   the MIB module is able to reuse the IEEE 802.11 MIB module
   [IEEE.802-11.2007].  The CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module does not duplicate
   those objects in the IEEE 802.11 MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11 [RFC5416] involves some
   of the MIB objects defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard.  Although
   CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module uses it [RFC5416] as a reference, it could
   reuse all the MIB objects in the IEEE 802.11 standard , and is not
   limited by the scope of CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.5"><h3>7.5   MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS</h3></a>

   The following MIB modules are required for IMPORTS: SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], and CAPWAP-BASE-MIB [RFC5833].

     }

      Suppose the WTP with model number 'WTP123' has one PHY radio and
      this PHY radio is identified by ID 1.  The creation of this WTP
      profile triggers the AC to automatically create a WTP Virtual

      capwapBaseWirelessBindingTable without manual intervention.
      Suppose the ifIndex of the WTP Virtual Radio Interface is 10.  The

   2) Query the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Before configuring PHY radios, the operator needs to get the
      ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces corresponding to the PHY
      radios.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      As the capwapBaseWirelessBindingTable already stores the mappings
      between PHY radios (Radio IDs) and the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual
      Radio Interfaces, the operator can get the ifIndex information by
      querying this table.  Such a query operation SHOULD run from radio
      ID 1 to radio ID 31 (according to [RFC5415]), and stop when an
      invalid ifIndex value (0) is returned.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This example uses capwapBaseWtpProfileId = 1 and
      capwapBaseWirelessBindingRadioId = 1 as inputs to query the
      capwapBaseWirelessBindingTable, and gets
      capwapBaseWirelessBindingVirtualRadioIfIndex = 10.  Then it uses
      capwapBaseWtpProfileId = 1 and capwapBaseWirelessBindingRadioId =
      2, and gets an invalid ifIndex value (0), so the query operation<br>
      ends.  This method gets not only the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual
      Radio Interfaces, but also the numbers of PHY radios.  Besides
      checking whether the ifIndex value is valid, the operator SHOULD
      check whether the capwapBaseWirelessBindingType is the desired
      binding type.

   4) Configure a WLAN Profile.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      WLAN configuration is made on the AC through the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB
      module, and IEEE 802.11 MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The first step is to create a WLAN Profile Interface through the
      CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module on the AC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For example, when you configure a WLAN profile that is identified
      by capwapDot11WlanProfileId 1, the capwapDot11WlanTable creates
      the following row object for it.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In capwapDot11WlanTable
      {
        capwapDot11WlanProfileId          = 1,
        capwapDot11WlanProfileIfIndex     = 20,
        capwapDot11WlanMacType            = splitMAC(2),<br>
        capwapDot11WlanTunnelMode         = dot3Tunnel(2),<br>
        capwapDot11WlanRowStatus          = createAndGo(4)
      }

      The creation of a row object triggers the AC to automatically
      create a WLAN Profile Interface and it is identified by ifIndex 20
      without manual intervention.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A WLAN Profile Interface MUST be modeled as an ifEntry on the AC
      that provides appropriate interface information.  The
      capwapDot11WlanTable stores the mappings between
      capwapDot11WlanProfileIds and the ifIndexes of WLAN Profile
      Interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In ifTable
      {
        ifIndex              = 20,
        ifDescr              = 'WLAN Profile Interface',
        ifType               = 252,
        ifMtu                = 0,
        ifSpeed              = 0,
        ifPhysAddress        = '00:00:00:00:00:00',
        ifAdminStatus        = true(1),<br>
        ifOperStatus         = true(1),<br>
        ifLastChange         = 0,
        ifInOctets           = 0,
        ifInUcastPkts        = 0,
        ifInDiscards         = 0,
        ifInErrors           = 0,

        ifOutOctets          = 0,
        ifOutUcastPkts       = 0,
        ifOutDiscards        = 0,
        ifOutErrors          = 0
      }

      The second step is to configure WLAN parameters for the WLAN
      Profile Interface through the IEEE 802.11 MIB module on the AC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The following example configures an authentication algorithm for a
      WLAN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable
      {
        ifIndex                                = 20,
        dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsIndex     = 1,
        dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm           = Shared Key(2),<br>
        dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsEnable    = true(1)
      }

      Here, ifIndex 20 identifies the WLAN Profile Interface, and the
      index of the configured authentication algorithm is 1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5) Bind WLAN Profiles to a WTP radio.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      On the AC, the capwapDot11WlanBindTable in the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB
      stores the bindings between WLAN profiles(identified by
      capwapDot11WlanProfileId) and WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces
      (identified by the ifIndex).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For example, after the operator binds a WLAN profile with
      capwapDot11WlanProfileId 1 to WTP Virtual Radio Interface with
      ifIndex 10, the capwapDot11WlanBindTable creates the following row
      object.
      In capwapDot11WlanBindTable
      {
        ifIndex                          = 10,
        capwapDot11WlanProfileId         = 1,
        capwapDot11WlanBindBssIfIndex    = 30,
        capwapDot11WlanBindRowStatus     = createAndGo(4)
      }

      If the capwapDot11WlanMacType of the WLAN is splitMAC(2), the<br>
      creation of the row object in the capwapDot11WlanBindTable
      triggers the AC to automatically create a WLAN BSS Interface
      identified by ifIndex 30 without manual intervention.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The WLAN BSS Interface MUST be modeled as an ifEntry on the AC,
      which provides appropriate interface information.  The
      capwapDot11WlanBindTable stores the mappings among the ifIndex of
      a WTP Virtual Radio Interface, WLAN profile ID, WLAN ID, and the
      ifIndex of a WLAN BSS Interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   6) Get the current configuration status report from the WTP to the
      AC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Before a WTP that has joined the AC gets configuration from the
      AC, it needs to report its current configuration status by sending
      a configuration status request message to the AC, which uses the
      message to update corresponding MIB objects on the AC.  For
      example, for ifIndex 10 (which identifies a WLAN Virtual Radio
      Interface), its ifOperStatus in the ifTable is updated according
      to the current radio operational status in the CAPWAP message
      [RFC5415].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   7) Query WTP and radio statistical data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      After WTPs start to run, the operator could query WTP and radio
      statistics data through the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB
      modules.  For example, through the dot11CountersTable
      [IEEE.802-11.2007], the operator could query counter data of a
      radio that is identified by the ifIndex of the corresponding WLAN
      Virtual Radio Interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   8) Query other statistical data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The operator could query the configuration of a WLAN through the
      dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable [IEEE.802-11.2007] and the
      statistical data of a WLAN BSS Interface through the ifTable

        "Represents the WLAN ID of a WLAN.
         During a binding operation, the AC MUST select an unused
         WLAN ID from between 1 and 16 [RFC5416].  For example, to bind
         another WLAN profile to a radio that has been bound with
         a WLAN profile, WLAN ID 2 should be assigned."

    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents the index value that uniquely identifies a
         WLAN BSS Interface.  The interface identified by a
         particular value of this index is the same interface as
         identified by the same value of the ifIndex.
         The ifIndex here is for a WLAN BSS Interface.
         The creation of a row object in the capwapDot11WlanBindTable
         triggers the AC to automatically create a WLAN BSS Interface
         identified by an ifIndex without manual intervention.
         The PHY address of the capwapDot11WlanBindBssIfIndex is the
         BSSID.  While manufacturers are free to assign BSSIDs by using
         any arbitrary mechanism, it is advised that where possible the
         BSSIDs are assigned as a contiguous block.
         When assigned as a block, implementations can still assign
         any of the available BSSIDs to any WLAN.  One possible method
         is for the WTP to assign the address using the following
         algorithm: base BSSID address + WLAN ID."

	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  The following are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  Unauthorized changes to the capwapDot11WlanTable and
      capwapDot11WlanBindTable MAY disrupt allocation of resources in
      the network, and also change the behavior of the WLAN system such
      as MAC type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
