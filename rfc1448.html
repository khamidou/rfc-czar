          1.  Introduction

          A network management system contains: several (potentially
          many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent,
          which has access to management instrumentation; at least one
          management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey
          management information between the agents and management
          stations.  Operations of the protocol are carried out under an
          administrative framework which defines both authentication and
          authorization policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Network management stations execute management applications
          which monitor and control network elements.  Network elements
          are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc.,
          which are monitored and controlled through access to their
          management information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Management information is viewed as a collection of managed
          objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the
          Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related
          objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written
          using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
          [1], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          The management protocol, version 2 of the Simple Network
          Management Protocol, provides for the exchange of messages
          which convey management information between the agents and the
          management stations.  The form of these messages is a message
          "wrapper" which encapsulates a Protocol Data Unit (PDU).  The
          form and meaning of the "wrapper" is determined by an
          administrative framework which defines both authentication and
          authorization policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          It is the purpose of this document, Protocol Operations for
          SNMPv2, to define the operations of the protocol with respect
          to the sending and receiving of the PDUs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
          1.1.  A Note on Terminology

          For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet-standard
          Network Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155, 1157,
          and 1212, is termed the SNMP version 1 framework (SNMPv1).
          The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2 framework
          (SNMPv2).
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


          2.  Overview

          2.1.  Roles of Protocol Entities

          A SNMPv2 entity may operate in a manager role or an agent
          role.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          A SNMPv2 entity acts in an agent role when it performs SNMPv2
          management operations in response to received SNMPv2 protocol
          messages (other than an inform notification) or when it sends
          trap notifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          A SNMPv2 entity acts in a manager role when it initiates
          SNMPv2 management operations by the generation of SNMPv2
          protocol messages or when it performs SNMPv2 management
          operations in response to received trap or inform
          notifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          A SNMPv2 entity may support either or both roles, as dictated
          by its implementation and configuration.  Further, a SNMPv2
          entity can also act in the role of a proxy agent, in which it
          appears to be acting in an agent role, but satisfies
          management requests by acting in a manager role with a remote
          entity.  The use of proxy agents and the transparency
          principle that defines their behavior is described in [3].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
          2.2.  Management Information

          The term, variable, refers to an instance of a non-aggregate
          object type defined according to the conventions set forth in
          the SMI [2] or the textual conventions based on the SMI [4].
          The term, variable binding, normally refers to the pairing of
          the name of a variable and its associated value.  However, if
          certain kinds of exceptional conditions occur during
          processing of a retrieval request, a variable binding will
          pair a name and an indication of that exception.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          A variable-binding list is a simple list of variable bindings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          The name of a variable is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER which is the
          concatenation of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the corresponding
          object-type together with an OBJECT IDENTIFIER fragment
          identifying the instance.  The OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the
          corresponding object-type is called the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


          prefix of the variable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
          2.3.  Access to Management Information

          Three types of access to management information are provided
          by the protocol.  One type is a request-response interaction,
          in which a SNMPv2 entity, acting in a manager role, sends a
          request to a SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, and the
          latter SNMPv2 entity then responds to the request.  This type
          is used to retrieve or modify management information
          associated with the managed device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          A second type is also a request-response interaction, in which
          a SNMPv2 entity, acting in a manager role, sends a request to
          a SNMPv2 entity, also acting in a manager role, and the latter
          SNMPv2 entity then responds to the request.  This type is used
          to notify a SNMPv2 entity, acting in a manager role, of
          management information associated with another SNMPv2 entity,
          also acting in a manager role.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          The third type of access is an unconfirmed interaction, in
          which a SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, sends a
          unsolicited message, termed a trap, to a SNMPv2 entity, acting
          in a manager role, and no response is returned.  This type is
          used to notify a SNMPv2 entity, acting in a manager role, of
          an exceptional situation, which has resulted in changes to
          management information associated with the managed device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
          2.4.  Retransmission of Requests

          For all types of request in this protocol, the receiver is
          required under normal circumstances, to generate and transmit
          a response to the originator of the request.  Whether or not a
          request should be retransmitted if no corresponding response
          is received in an appropriate time interval, is at the
          discretion of the application originating the request.  This
          will normally depend on the urgency of the request.  However,
          such an application needs to act responsibly in respect to the
          frequency and duration of re-transmissions.
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


          2.5.  Message Sizes

          The maximum size of a SNMPv2 message is limited the minimum
          of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (1)  the maximum message size which the destination SNMPv2<br>
               entity can accept; and,

          (2)  the maximum message size which the source SNMPv2 entity<br>
               can generate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          The former is indicated by partyMaxMessageSize[5] of the
          destination party.  The latter is imposed by implementation-
          specific local constraints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Each transport mapping for the SNMPv2 indicates the minimum
          message size which a SNMPv2 implementation must be able to
          produce or consume.  Although implementations are encouraged
          to support larger values whenever possible, a conformant
          implementation must never generate messages larger than
          allowed by the receiving SNMPv2 entity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          One of the aims of the GetBulkRequest-PDU, specified in this
          protocol, is to minimize the number of protocol exchanges
          required to retrieve a large amount of management information.
          As such, this PDU type allows a SNMPv2 entity acting in a
          manager role to request that the response be as large as
          possible given the constraints on message sizes.  These
          constraints include the limits on the size of messages which
          the SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role can generate, and
          the SNMPv2 entity acting in a manager role can receive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          However, it is possible that such maximum sized messages may
          be larger than the Path MTU of the path across the network
          traversed by the messages.  In this situation, such messages
          are subject to fragmentation.  Fragmentation is generally
          considered to be harmful [6], since among other problems, it
          leads to a decrease in the reliability of the transfer of the
          messages.  Thus, a SNMPv2 entity which sends a
          GetBulkRequest-PDU must take care to set its parameters
          accordingly, so as to reduce the risk of fragmentation.  In
          particular, under conditions of network stress, only small
          values should be used for max-repetitions.
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


          2.6.  Transport Mappings

          It is important to note that the exchange of SNMPv2 messages
          requires only an unreliable datagram service, with every
          message being entirely and independently contained in a single
          transport datagram.  Specific transport mappings and encoding
          rules are specified elsewhere [7].  However, the preferred
          mapping is the use of the User Datagram Protocol [8].

          4.  Protocol Specification


          4.1.  Common Constructs

          The value of the request-id field in a Response-PDU takes the
          value of the request-id field in the request PDU to which it
          is a response.  By use of the request-id value, a SNMPv2
          application can distinguish the (potentially multiple)
          outstanding requests, and thereby correlate incoming responses
          with outstanding requests.  In cases where an unreliable
          datagram service is used, the request-id also provides a
          simple means of identifying messages duplicated by the
          network.  Use of the same request-id on a retransmission of a
          request allows the response to either the original
          transmission or the retransmission to satisfy the request.
          However, in order to calculate the round trip time for
          transmission and processing of a request-response transaction,
          the SNMPv2 application needs to use a different request-id
          value on a retransmitted request.  The latter strategy is
          recommended for use in the majority of situations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          A non-zero value of the error-status field in a Response-PDU
          is used to indicate that an exception occurred to prevent the
          processing of the request.  In these cases, a non-zero value
          of the Response-PDU's error-index field provides additional
          information by identifying which variable binding in the list
          caused the exception.  A variable binding is identified by its
          index value.  The first variable binding in a variable-binding
          list is index one, the second is index two, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          SNMPv2 limits OBJECT IDENTIFIER values to a maximum of 128
          sub-identifiers, where each sub-identifier has a maximum value
          of 2**32-1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
          4.2.  PDU Processing

          It is mandatory that all SNMPv2 entities acting in an agent
          role be able to generate the following PDU types: Response-PDU
          and SNMPv2-Trap-PDU; further, all such implementations must be
          able to receive the following PDU types: GetRequest-PDU,
          GetNextRequest-PDU, GetBulkRequest-PDU, and SetRequest-PDU.
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


          It is mandatory that all SNMPv2 entities acting in a manager
          role be able to generate the following PDU types: GetRequest-
          PDU, GetNextRequest-PDU, GetBulkRequest-PDU, SetRequest-PDU,
          InformRequest-PDU, and Response-PDU; further, all such
          implementations must be able to receive the following PDU
          types: Response-PDU, SNMPv2-Trap-PDU, InformRequest-PDU;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          In the elements of procedure below, any field of a PDU which
          is not referenced by the relevant procedure is ignored by the
          receiving SNMPv2 entity.  However, all components of a PDU,
          including those whose values are ignored by the receiving
          SNMPv2 entity, must have valid ASN.1 syntax and encoding.  For
          example, some PDUs (e.g., the GetRequest-PDU) are concerned
          only with the name of a variable and not its value.  In this
          case, the value portion of the variable binding is ignored by
          the receiving SNMPv2 entity.  The unSpecified value is defined
          for use as the value portion of such bindings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          For all generated PDUs, the message "wrapper" to encapsulate
          the PDU is generated and transmitted as specified in [3].  The
          size of a message is limited only by constraints on the
          maximum message size, either a local limitation or the limit
          associated with the message's destination party, i.e., it is
          not limited by the number of variable bindings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          On receiving a management communication, the procedures
          defined in Section 3.2 of [3] are followed.  If these
          procedures indicate that the PDU contained within the message
          "wrapper" is to be processed, then the SNMPv2 context
          associated with the PDU defines the object resources which are
          visible to the operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Upon receipt of a SetRequest-PDU, the receiving SNMPv2 entity

          index and variable-bindings fields as the received
          SetRequest-PDU.  If the determined message size is greater

          constraint and the maximum message size of the request's
          source party, it is transmitted to the originator of the

          terminates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          If and only if it is not possible to undo all the assignments,
          then the Response-PDU is modified to have the value of its
          error-status field set to `undoFailed', and the value of its
          error-index field is set to zero.  Note that implementations
          are strongly encouraged to take all possible measures to avoid
          use of either `commitFailed' or `undoFailed' - these two
          error-status codes are not to be taken as license to take the
          easy way out in an implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Finally, the generated Response-PDU is encapsulated into a

          4.2.6.  The SNMPv2-Trap-PDU

          A SNMPv2-Trap-PDU is generated and transmitted by a SNMPv2
          entity acting in an agent role when an exceptional situation
          occurs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          The destination(s) to which a SNMPv2-Trap-PDU is sent is
          determined by consulting the aclTable [5] to find all entries
          satisfying the following conditions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (1)  The value of aclSubject refers to the SNMPv2 entity.<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (2)  The value of aclPrivileges allows for the SNMPv2-Trap-<br>
               PDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (3)  aclResources refers to a SNMPv2 context denoting local<br>
               object resources, and the notification's administratively
               assigned name is present in the corresponding MIB view.
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


               (That is, the set of entries in the viewTable [5] for
               which the instance of viewIndex has the same value as the
               aclResources's contextViewIndex, define a MIB view which
               contains the notification's administratively assigned
               name.)

          (4)  If the OBJECTS clause is present in the invocation of the<br>
               corresponding NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro, then the
               correspondent variables are all present in the MIB view
               corresponding to aclResource.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Then, for each entry satisfying these conditions, a SNMPv2-
          Trap-PDU is sent from aclSubject with context aclResources to
          aclTarget.  The instance of snmpTrapNumbers [11] corresponding
          to aclTarget is incremented, and is used as the request-id
          field of the SNMPv2-Trap-PDU.  Then, the variable-bindings
          field are constructed as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (1)  The first variable is sysUpTime.0 [9].<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (2)  The second variable is snmpTrapOID.0 [11], which contains<br>
               the administratively assigned name of the notification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (3)  If the OBJECTS clause is present in the invocation of the<br>
               corresponding NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro, then each
               corresponding variable is copied, in order, to the
               variable-bindings field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (4)  At the option of the SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent<br>
               role, additional variables may follow in the variable-
               bindings field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
          4.2.7.  The InformRequest-PDU

          An InformRequest-PDU is generated and transmitted at the
          request an application in a SNMPv2 entity acting in a manager
          role, that wishes to notify another application (in a SNMPv2
          entity also acting in a manager role) of information in the
          MIB View of a party local to the sending application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          The destination(s) to which an InformRequest-PDU is sent is
          determined by inspecting the snmpEventNotifyTable [12], or as
          specified by the requesting application.  The first two
          variable bindings in the variable binding list of an
          RFC 1448        Protocol Operations for SNMPv2      April 1993


          InformRequest-PDU are sysUpTime.0 [9] and snmpEventID.i [12]
          respectively.  If the OBJECTS clause is present in the
          invocation of the corresponding NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro, then
          each corresponding variable, as instantiated by this
          notification, is copied, in order, to the variable-bindings
          field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Upon receipt of an InformRequest-PDU, the receiving SNMPv2
          entity determines the size of a message encapsulating a
          Response-PDU with the same values in its request-id, error-
          status, error-index and variable-bindings fields as the
          received InformRequest-PDU.  If the determined message size is
          greater than either a local constraint or the maximum message
          size of the request's source party, then an alternate
          Response-PDU is generated, transmitted to the originator of
          the InformRequest-PDU, and processing of the InformRequest-PDU
          terminates immediately thereafter.  This alternate Response-
          PDU is formatted with the same values in its request-id field
          as the received InformRequest-PDU, with the value of its
          error-status field set to `tooBig', the value of its error-
          index field set to zero, and an empty variable-bindings field.
          This alternate Response-PDU is then encapsulated into a
          message.  If the size of the resultant message is less than or
          equal to both a local constraint and the maximum message size
          of the request's source party, it is transmitted to the
          originator of the InformRequest-PDU.  Otherwise, the resultant
          message is discarded.  Regardless, processing of the
          InformRequest-PDU terminates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Otherwise, the receiving SNMPv2 entity:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (1)  presents its contents to the appropriate SNMPv2<br>
               application;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          (2)  generates a Response-PDU with the same values in its<br>
               request-id and variable-bindings fields as the received
               InformRequest-PDU, with the value of its error-status
               field is set to `noError' and the value of its error-
               index field is zero; and

          (3)  transmits the generated Response-PDU to the originator of<br>
               the InformRequest-PDU.
