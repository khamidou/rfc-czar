                          Comments on RFC #123
                          --------------------



        The requirement that byte size 's' be 32-bits for
the initial connection imposes some severe strains on some of
the 36-bit machines. For example, in our PDP-10 (DMCG-
ITS) NCP, we have at present no way of sending or receiving
exactly 32-bits of data. Data is transmitted either in
image mode (36-bit bytes) or in ASCII mode (8-bit characters
with the 8th bit as zero). Perhaps we should permit the
server to send more than 32-bits (say 72-bits) where the
remaining bits could be NULL fillers. The byte size
's' for the connection may be fixed at 8-bits.
