   This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for
   group key management to support secure group communications.  The
   GDOI manages group security associations, which are used by IPSEC and
   potentially other data security protocols running at the IP or
   application layers.  These security associations protect one or more
   key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group
   members.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for
   group key management called the "Group Domain of Interpretation"
   (GDOI).  In this group key management model, the GDOI protocol is run
   between a group member and a "group controller/key server" (GCKS),
   which establishes security associations [Section 4.6.2 RFC2401] among
   authorized group members.  ISAKMP defines two "phases" of negotiation
   [p.16 RFC2408].  The GDOI MUST be protected by a Phase 1 security
   association.  This document incorporates the Phase 1 security
   association (SA) definition from the Internet DOI [RFC2407, RFC2409].
   Other possible Phase 1 security association types are noted in
   Appendix A.  The Phase 2 exchange is defined in this document, and
   proposes new payloads and exchanges according to the ISAKMP standard
   [p. 14 RFC2408].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are six new payloads:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1) GDOI SA
      2) SA KEK (SAK) which follows the SA payload
      3) SA TEK (SAT) which follows the SA payload
      4) Key Download Array (KD)
      5) Sequence number (SEQ)
      6) Proof of Possession (POP)

   There are two new exchanges.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) A Phase 2 exchange creates Re-key and Data-Security Protocol SAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The new Phase 2 exchange, called "GROUPKEY-PULL," downloads keys for
   a group's "Re-key" SA and/or "Data-security" SA.  The Re-key SA
   includes a key encrypting key, or KEK, common to the group; a
   Data-security SA includes a data encryption key, or TEK, used by a
   data-security protocol to encrypt or decrypt data traffic [Section
   2.1 RFC2407].  The SA for the KEK or TEK includes authentication
   keys, encryption keys, cryptographic policy, and attributes.  The
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchange uses "pull" behavior since the member
   initiates the retrieval of these SAs from a GCKS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2) A datagram subsequently establishes additional Rekey and/or
   Data-Security Protocol SAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GROUPKEY-PUSH datagram is "pushed" from the GCKS to the members
   to create or update a Re-key or Data-security SA.  A Re-key SA
   protects GROUPKEY-PUSH messages.  Thus, a GROUPKEY-PULL is necessary
   to establish at least one Re-key SA in order to protect subsequent
   GROUPKEY-PUSH messages.  The GCKS encrypts the GROUPKEY-PUSH message
   using the KEK Re-key SA.  GDOI accommodates the use of arrays of KEKs
   for group key management algorithms using the Logical Key Hierarchy
   (LKH) algorithm to efficiently add and remove group members
   [RFC2627].  Implementation of the LKH algorithm is OPTIONAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although the GROUPKEY-PUSH specified by this document can be used to
   refresh a Re-key SA, the most common use of GROUPKEY-PUSH is to
   establish a Data-security SA for a data security protocol.  GDOI can
   accommodate future extensions to support a variety of data security
   protocols.  This document only specifies data-security SAs for one
   security protocol, IPsec ESP.  A separate RFC will specify support
   for other data security protocols such as a future secure Real-time
   Transport Protocol.  A security protocol uses the TEK and "owns" the
   data-security SA in the same way that IPsec ESP uses the IKE Phase 2
   keys and owns the Phase 2 SA; for GDOI, IPsec ESP uses the TEK.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Thus, GDOI is a group security association management protocol: All
   GDOI messages are used to create, maintain, or delete security
   associations for a group.  As described above, these security
   associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys,
   traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group members for
   multicast and groups security applications.
   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   GDOI Applications</h3></a>

   Secure multicast applications include video broadcast and multicast
   file transfer.  In a business environment, many of these applications
   require network security and may use IPsec ESP to secure their data
   traffic.  Section 5.4.1 specifies how GDOI carries the needed SA
   parameters for ESP.  In this way, GDOI supports multicast ESP with
   group authentication of ESP packets using the shared, group key
   (authentication of unique sources of ESP packets is not possible).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GDOI can also secure group applications that do not use multicast
   transport such as video-on-demand.  For example, the GROUPKEY-PUSH
   message may establish a pair-wise IPsec ESP SA for a member of a
   subscription group without the need for key management exchanges and
   costly asymmetric cryptography.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Extending GDOI</h3></a>

   Not all secure multicast or multimedia applications can use IPsec
   ESP.  Many Real Time Transport Protocol applications, for example,
   require security above the IP layer to preserve RTP header
   compression efficiencies and transport-independence [RFC3550].  A
   future RTP security protocol may benefit from using GDOI to establish
   group SAs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to add a new data security protocol, a new RFC MUST specify
   the data-security SA parameters conveyed by GDOI for that security
   protocol; these parameters are listed in section 5.4.2 of this
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Data security protocol SAs MUST protect group traffic.  GDOI provides
   no restriction on whether that group traffic is transmitted as
   unicast or multicast packets.  However, GDOI MUST NOT be used as a
   key management mechanism by a data security protocol when the packets
   protected by the data-security SA are intended to be private and
   never become part of group communications.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   GDOI Phase 1 protocol</h2></a>

   GDOI is a "phase 2" protocol which MUST be protected by a "phase 1"
   protocol.  The "phase 1" protocol can be any protocol which provides
   for the following protections:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o Peer Authentication
   o Confidentiality
   o Message Integrity

   The following sections describe one such "phase 1" protocol.  Other
   protocols which may be potential "phase 1" protocols are described in
   Appendix A.  However, the use of the protocols listed there are not
   considered part of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   ISAKMP Phase 1 protocol</h3></a>

   This document defines how the ISAKMP phase 1 exchanges as defined in
   [RFC2409] can be used a "phase 1" protocol for GDOI.  The following
   sections define characteristics of the ISAKMP phase 1 protocols that
   are unique for these exchanges when used for GDOI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Section 6.1 describes how the ISAKMP Phase 1 protocols meet the
   requirements of a GDOI "phase 1" protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.1"><h4>2.1.1   DOI value</h4></a>

   The Phase 1 SA payload has a DOI value.  That value MUST be the GDOI
   DOI value as defined later in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.2"><h4>2.1.2   UDP port</h4></a>

   GDOI MUST NOT run on port 500 (the port commonly used for IKE).  IANA
   has assigned port 848 for the use of GDOI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   GROUPKEY-PULL Exchange</h2></a>

   The goal of the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange is to establish a Re-key
   and/or Data-security SAs at the member for a particular group.  A
   Phase 1 SA protects the GROUPKEY-PULL; there MAY be multiple
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchanges for a given Phase 1 SA.  The GROUPKEY-PULL
   exchange downloads the data security keys (TEKs) and/or group key
   encrypting key (KEK) or KEK array under the protection of the Phase 1
   SA.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Authorization</h3></a>

   There are two alternative means for authorizing the GROUPKEY-PULL
   message.  First, the Phase 1 identity can be used to authorize the
   Phase 2 (GROUPKEY-PULL) request for a group key.  Second, a new
   identity can be passed in the GROUPKEY-PULL request.  The new
   identity could be specific to the group and use a certificate that is
   signed by the group owner to identify the holder as an authorized
   group member.  The Proof-of-Possession payload validates that the
   holder possesses the secret key associated with the Phase 2 identity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Messages</h3></a>

   The GROUPKEY-PULL is a Phase 2 exchange.  Phase 1 computes SKEYID_a
   which is the "key" in the keyed hash used in the GROUPKEY-PULL HASH
   payloads.  When using the Phase 1 defined in this document, SKEYID_a
   is derived according to [RFC2409].  As with the IKE HASH payload
   generation [RFC 2409 section 5.5], each GROUPKEY-PULL message hashes
   a uniquely defined set of values.  Nonces permute the HASH and
   provide some protection against replay attacks.  Replay protection is
   important to protect the GCKS from attacks that a key management
   server will attract.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GROUPKEY-PULL uses nonces to guarantee "liveliness", or against
   replay of a recent GROUPKEY-PULL message.  The replay attack is only
   useful in the context of the current Phase 1.  If a GROUPKEY-PULL
   message is replayed based on a previous Phase 1, the HASH calculation
   will fail due to a wrong SKEYID_a.  The message will fail processing
   before the nonce is ever evaluated.  In order for either peer to get
   the benefit of the replay protection, it must postpone as much
   processing as possible until it receives the message in the protocol
   that proves the peer is live.  For example, the Responder MUST NOT
   compute the shared Diffie-Hellman number (if KE payloads were
   included) or install the new SAs until it receives a message with Nr
   included properly in the HASH payload.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Nonces require an additional message in the protocol exchange to
   ensure that the GCKS does not add a group member until it proves

     POP payload is constructed as described in Section 5.7.
   * Protected by the Phase 1 SA, encryption occurs after HDR

   HDR is an ISAKMP header payload that uses the Phase 1 cookies and a
   message identifier (M-ID) as in IKE [RFC2409].  Note that nonces are
   included in the first two exchanges, with the GCKS returning only the
   SA policy payload before liveliness is proven.  The HASH payloads
   [RFC2409] prove that the peer has the Phase 1 secret (SKEYID_a) and
   the nonce for the exchange identified by message id, M-ID.  Once
   liveliness is established, the last message completes the real
   processing of downloading the KD payload.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to the Nonce and HASH payloads, the member-initiator
   identifies the group it wishes to join through the ISAKMP ID payload.
   The GCKS responder informs the member of the current value of the
   sequence number in the SEQ payload; the sequence number orders the
   GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams (section 4); the member MUST check to see
   that the sequence number is greater than in the previous SEQ payload
   the member holds for the group (if it holds any) before installing
   any new SAs.  The SEQ payload MUST be present if the SA payload
   contains an SA KEK attribute.  The GCKS responder informs the member
   of the cryptographic policies of the group in the SA payload, which
   describes the DOI, KEK and/or TEK keying material, and authentication
   transforms.  The SPIs are also determined by the GCKS and downloaded
   in the SA payload chain (see section 5.2).  The SA KEK attribute
   contains the ISAKMP cookie pair for the Re-key SA, which is not
   negotiated but downloaded.  The SA TEK attribute contains an SPI as
   defined in section 5.4 of this document.  The second message
   downloads this SA payload.  If a Re-key SA is defined in the SA
   payload, then KD will contain the KEK; if one or more Data-security
   SAs are defined in the SA payload, KD will contain the TEKs.  This is
   useful if there is an initial set of TEKs for the particular group
   and can obviate the need for future TEK GROUPKEY-PUSH messages
   (described in section 4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As described above, the member may establish an identity in the
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchange in an optional CERT payload that is separate
   from the Phase 1 identity.  When the member passes a new CERT, a
   proof of possession (POP) payload accompanies it.  The POP payload
   demonstrates that the member or GCKS has used the very secret that
   authenticates it.  POP_I is an ISAKMP SIG payload containing a hash
   including the nonces Ni and Nr signed by the member, when the member
   passes a CERT, signed by the Group Owner to prove its authorization.
   POP_R contains the hash including the concatenated nonces Ni and Nr
   signed by the GCKS, when the GCKS passes a CERT, signed by the group
   owner, to prove its authority to provide keys for a particular group.
   The use of the nonce pair for the POP payload, transformed through a
   pseudo-random function (prf) and encrypted, is designed to withstand
   compromise of the Phase 1 key.  Implementation of the CERT and POP
   payloads is OPTIONAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   Perfect Forward Secrecy</h4></a>

   If PFS is desired and the optional KE payload is used in the
   exchange, then both sides compute a DH secret and use it to protect
   the new keying material contained in KD.  The GCKS responder will xor
   the DH secret with the KD payload and send it to the member
   Initiator, which recovers the KD by repeating this operation as in
   the Oakley IEXTKEY procedure [RFC2412].  Implementation of the KE

   Before a group member (GDOI initiator) contacts the GCKS, it must
   determine the group identifier and acceptable Phase 1 policy via an
   out-of-band method such as SDP.  Phase 1 is initiated using the GDOI
   DOI in the SA payload.  Once Phase 1 is complete, the initiator state
   machine moves to the GDOI protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To construct the first GDOI message the initiator chooses Ni and
   creates a nonce payload, builds an identity payload including the
   group identifier, and generates HASH(1).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of the second GDOI message, the initiator validates
   HASH(2), extracts the nonce Nr, and interprets the SA payload.  If<br>
   the policy in the SA payload is acceptable (e.g., the security
   protocol and cryptographic protocols can be supported by the
   initiator), the initiator continues the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the group policy uses certificates for authorization, the
   initiator generates a hash including Ni and Nr and signs it.  This
   becomes the contents of the POP payload.  If necessary, a CERT
   payload is constructed which holds the public key corresponding to
   the private key used to sign the POP payload.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The initiator constructs the third GDOI message by including the CERT

   GROUPKEY-PULL messages happened in parallel, and the sequence number
   changed between the times the results of two GROUPKEY-PULL messages
   were returned from the GCKS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The initiator interprets the KD key packets, matching the SPIs in the
   key packets to SPIs previously sent in the SA payloads identifying
   particular policy.  For TEKs, once the keys and policy are matched,
   the initiator is ready to send or receive packets matching the TEK
   policy.  (If policy and keys had been previously received for this
   TEK policy, the initiator may decide instead to ignore this TEK
   policy in case it is stale.)  If this group has a KEK, the KEK policy
   and keys are marked as ready for use.

   GDOI sends control information securely using group communications.
   Typically this will be using IP multicast distribution of a
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message but it can also be "pushed" using unicast
   delivery if IP multicast is not possible.  The GROUPKEY-PUSH message
   replaces a Re-key SA KEK or KEK array, and/or creates a new

   * Protected by the Re-key SA KEK; encryption occurs after HDR

   HDR is defined below.  The SEQ payload is defined in the Payloads
   section.  The SA defines the policy (e.g., protection suite) and
   attributes (e.g., SPI) for a Re-key and/or Data-security SAs.  The
   GCKS or delegate optionally provides a CERT payload for verification
   of the SIG.  KD is the key download payload as described in the
   Payloads section.
   The SIG payload is a signature of a hash of the entire message before
   encryption (including the header and excluding the SIG payload
   itself), prefixed with the string "rekey".  The prefixed string
   ensures that the signature of the Rekey datagram cannot be used for
   any other purpose in the GDOI protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the SA defines an LKH KEK array or single KEK, KD contains a KEK
   or KEK array for a new Re-key SA, which has a new cookie pair.  When
   the KD payload carries a new SA KEK attribute (section 5.3), a Re-key
   SA is replaced with a new SA having the same group identifier (ID
   specified in message 1 of section 3.2) and incrementing the same
   sequence counter, which is initialized in message 4 of section 3.2.
   If the SA defines an SA TEK payload, this informs the member that a
   new Data-security SA has been created, with keying material carried
   in KD (Section 5.5).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the SA defines a large LKH KEK array (e.g., during group
   initialization and batched rekeying), parts of the array MAY be sent
   in different unique GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams.  However, each of the
   GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams MUST be a fully formed GROUPKEY-PUSH
   datagram.  This results in each datagram containing a sequence number
   and the policy in the SA payload, which corresponds to the KEK array
   portion sent in the KD payload.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)</h3></a>

   The GROUPKEY-PUSH message is protected by the group KEK though in all
   cases, the GROUPKEY-PUSH message carries new key downloads, among
   other information.  A freshly generated secret must protect the key
   download for the GROUPKEY-PUSH message to have PFS.  This issue is
   for further study.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Forward and Backward Access Control</h3></a>

   Through GROUPKEY-PUSH, the GDOI supports algorithms such as LKH that
   have the property of denying access to a new group key by a member
   removed from the group (forward access control) and to an old group
   key by a member added to the group (backward access control).  An
   unrelated notion to PFS, "forward access control" and "backward
   access control" have been called "perfect forward security" and
   "perfect backward security" in the literature [RFC2627].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Group management algorithms providing forward and backward access
   control other than LKH have been proposed in the literature,
   including OFT [OFT] and Subset Difference [NNL].  These algorithms
   could be used with GDOI, but are not specified as a part of this
   document.
   Support for group management algorithms is supported via the
   KEY_MANAGEMENT_ALGORITHM attribute which is sent in the SA_KEK
   payload.  GDOI specifies one method by which LKH can be used for
   forward and backward access control.  Other methods of using LKH, as
   well as other group management algorithms such as OFT or Subset
   Difference may be added to GDOI as part of a later document.  Any
   such addition MUST be due to a Standards Action as defined in
   [RFC2434].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2.1"><h4>4.2.1   Forward Access Control Requirements</h4></a>

   When group membership is altered using a group management algorithm
   new SA_TEKs (and their associated keys) are usually also needed.  New
   SAs and keys ensure that members who were denied access can no longer
   participate in the group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If forward access control is a desired property of the group, new
   SA_TEKs and the associated key packets in the KD payload MUST NOT be
   included in a GROUPKEY-PUSH message which changes group membership.
   This is required because the SA_TEK policy and the associated key
   packets in the KD payload are not protected with the new KEK.  A
   second GROUPKEY-PUSH message can deliver the new SA_TEKS and their
   associated keys because it will be protected with the new KEK, and
   thus will not be visible to the members who were denied access.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If forward access control policy for the group includes keeping group
   policy changes from members that are denied access to the group, then
   two sequential GROUPKEY-PUSH messages changing the group KEK MUST be
   sent by the GCKS.  The first GROUPKEY-PUSH message creates a new KEK
   for the group.  Group members, which are denied access, will not be
   able to access the new KEK, but will see the group policy since the
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message is protected under the current KEK.  A
   subsequent GROUPKEY-PUSH message containing the changed group policy
   and again changing the KEK allows complete forward access control.  A
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message MUST NOT change the policy without creating a
   new KEK.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If other methods of using LKH or other group management algorithms
   are added to GDOI, those methods MAY remove the above restrictions
   requiring multiple GROUPKEY-PUSH messages, providing those methods
   specify how forward access control policy is maintained within a
   single GROUPKEY-PUSH message.
	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Delegation of Key Management</h3></a>

   GDOI supports delegation of GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams through the

   to the PKI that is used by a particular GDOI implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Use of signature keys</h3></a>

   The GCKS SHOULD NOT use the same key to sign the SIG payload in the

   SA.  Alternatively, group policy might use a Re-key SA but choose to
   download a KEK to the group member only as part of the Registration

   The Sequence Number Payload fields are defined as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Next Payload (1 octet) -- Identifier for the payload type of
         the next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the
         last in the message, then this field will be zero.
      o  RESERVED (1 octet) -- Unused, set to zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Payload Length (2 octets) -- Length in octets of the current
         payload, including the generic payload header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Sequence Number (4 octets) -- This field contains a
         monotonically increasing counter value for the group.  It is
         initialized to zero by the GCKS, and incremented in each
         subsequently-transmitted message.  Thus the first packet sent
         for a given Rekey SA will have a Sequence Number of 1.  The
         GDOI implementation keeps a sequence counter as an attribute
         for the Rekey SA and increments the counter upon receipt of a
         GROUPKEY-PUSH message.  The current value of the sequence
         number must be transmitted to group members as a part of the
         Registration SA SA payload.  A group member must keep a sliding
         receive window.  The window must be treated as in the ESP
         protocol [RFC2406] Section 3.4.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.7"><h3>5.7   Proof of Possession</h3></a>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   GDOI is a security association (SA) management protocol for groups of
   senders and receivers.  Unlike a data security protocol, SA
   management includes a key establishment protocol to securely
   establish keys at communication endpoints.  This protocol performs
   entity authentication of the GDOI member or Group Controller/Key
   Server (GCKS), it provides confidentiality of key management
   messages, and it provides source authentication of those messages.
   This protocol also uses best-known practices for defense against
   man-in-middle, connection hijacking, replay, reflection, and
   denial-of-service (DOS) attacks on unsecured networks [STS, RFC2522,
   SKEME].  GDOI assumes the network is not secure and may be under the
   complete control of an attacker.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GDOI assumes that the host computer is secure even though the network
   is insecure.  GDOI ultimately establishes keys among members of a
   group, which MUST be trusted to use those keys in an authorized
   manner according to group policy.  The security of GDOI, therefore,
   is as good as the degree to which group members can be trusted to
   protect authenticators, encryption keys, decryption keys, and message
   authentication keys.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are three phases of GDOI as described in this document: an
   ISAKMP Phase 1 protocol, a new exchange called GROUPKEY-PULL which is
   protected by the ISAKMP Phase 1 protocol, and a new message called
   GROUPKEY-PUSH.  Each phase is considered separately below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   ISAKMP Phase 1</h3></a>

   As described in this document, GDOI uses the Phase 1 exchanges
   defined in [RFC2409] to protect the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange.
   Therefore all security properties and considerations of those
   exchanges (as noted in [RFC2409]) are relevant for GDOI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GDOI may inherit the problems of its ancestor protocols [FS00], such
   as identity exposure, absence of unidirectional authentication, or
   stateful cookies [PK01].  GDOI could benefit, however, from
   improvements to its ancestor protocols just as it benefits from years
   of experience and work embodied in those protocols.  To reap the
   benefits of future IKE improvements, however, GDOI would need to be
   revised in a future standards-track RFC, which is beyond the scope of
   this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.1"><h4>6.1.1   Authentication</h4></a>

   Authentication is provided via the mechanisms defined in [RFC2409],
   namely Pre-Shared Keys or Public Key encryption.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.2"><h4>6.1.2   Confidentiality</h4></a>

   Confidentiality is achieved in Phase 1 through a Diffie-Hellman
   exchange that provides keying material, and through negotiation of
   encryption transforms.
   The Phase 1 protocol will be protecting encryption and integrity keys
   sent in the GROUPKEY-PULL protocol.  The strength of the encryption
   used for Phase 1 SHOULD exceed that of the keys send in the
   GROUPKEY-PULL protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.3"><h4>6.1.3   Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection</h4></a>

   A successful man-in-the-middle or connection-hijacking attack foils
   entity authentication of one or more of the communicating entities
   during key establishment.  GDOI relies on Phase 1 authentication to
   defeat man-in-the-middle attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.4"><h4>6.1.4   Replay/Reflection Attack Protection</h4></a>

   In a replay/reflection attack, an attacker captures messages between
   GDOI entities and subsequently forwards them to a GDOI entity.
   Replay and reflection attacks seek to gain information from a
   subsequent GDOI message response or seek to disrupt the operation of
   a GDOI member or GCKS entity.  GDOI relies on the Phase 1 nonce
   mechanism in combination with a hash-based message authentication
   code to protect against the replay or reflection of previous key
   management messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1.5"><h4>6.1.5   Denial of Service Protection</h4></a>

   A denial of service attacker sends messages to a GDOI entity to cause
   that entity to perform unneeded message authentication operations.
   GDOI uses the Phase 1 cookie mechanism to identify spurious messages
   prior to cryptographic hash processing.  This is a "weak" form of
   denial of service protection in that the GDOI entity must check for
   good cookies, which can be successfully imitated by a sophisticated
   attacker.  The Phase 1 cookie mechanism is stateful, and commits
   memory resources for cookies, but stateless cookies are a better
   defense against denial of service attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   GROUPKEY-PULL Exchange</h3></a>

   The GROUPKEY-PULL exchange allows a group member to request SAs and
   keys from a GCKS.  It runs as a "phase 2" protocol under protection
   of the Phase 1 security association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.1"><h4>6.2.1   Authentication</h4></a>

   Peer authentication is not required in the GROUPKEY-PULL protocol.
   It is running in the context of the Phase 1 protocol, which has
   previously authenticated the identity of the peer.
   Message authentication is provided by HASH payloads in each message,
   where the HASH is defined to be over SKEYID_a (derived in the Phase 1
   exchange), the ISAKMP Message-ID, and all payloads in the message.
   Because only the two endpoints of the exchange know the SKEYID_a
   value, this provides confidence that the peer sent the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.2"><h4>6.2.2   Confidentiality</h4></a>

   Confidentiality is provided by the Phase 1 security association,
   after the manner described in [RFC2409].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.3"><h4>6.2.3   Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection</h4></a>

   Message authentication (described above) includes a secret known only
   to the group member and GCKS when constructing a HASH payload. This
   prevents man-in-the-middle and connection-hijacking attacks because
   an attacker would not be able to change the message undetected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.4"><h4>6.2.4   Replay/Reflection Attack Protection</h4></a>

   Nonces provide freshness of the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange.  The group
   member and GCKS exchange nonce values first two messages.  These
   nonces are included in subsequent HASH payload calculations.  The
   Group member and GCKS MUST NOT perform any computationally expensive
   tasks before receiving a HASH with its own nonce included.  The GCKS
   MUST NOT update the group management state (e.g., LKH key tree) until
   it receives the third message in the exchange with a valid HASH
   payload including its own nonce.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations SHOULD keep a record of recently received
   GROUPKEY-PULL messages and reject messages that have already been
   processed.  This enables an early discard of the replayed messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2.5"><h4>6.2.5   Denial of Service Protection</h4></a>

   A GROUPKEY-PULL message identifies its messages using a cookie pair
   from the Phase 1 exchange that precedes it.  The cookies provide a
   weak form of denial of service protection as described above, in the
   sense that a GROUPKEY-PULL message with invalid cookies will be
   discarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The replay protection mechanisms described above provide the basis
   for denial of service protection.
	<a name="section-6.2.6"><h4>6.2.6   Authorization</h4></a>

   The CERT payload in a GROUPKEY-PULL exchange allows a group member or
   GCKS to submit a certificate containing authorization attributes to
   the peer as well as identifying a public/private key pair.  The
   GROUPKEY-PULL POP payload enables authorization to be accomplished
   where the authorization infrastructure is different than the
   GROUPKEY-PULL authentication infrastructure by proving that it is in
   possession of the private key.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   GROUPKEY-PUSH Exchange</h3></a>

   The GROUPKEY-PUSH exchange is a single message that allows a GCKS to
   send SAs and keys to group members.  This is likely to be sent to all
   members using an IP multicast group.  This provides an efficient
   rekey and group membership adjustment capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.1"><h4>6.3.1   Authentication</h4></a>

   The GROUPKEY-PULL exchange identifies a public key that is used for
   message authentication.  The GROUPKEY-PUSH message is digitally
   signed using the corresponding private key held by the GCKS or its
   delegate.  This digital signature provides source authentication for
   the message.  Thus, GDOI protects the GCKS from impersonation in
   group environments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.2"><h4>6.3.2   Confidentiality</h4></a>

   The GCKS encrypts the GROUPKEY-PUSH message with an encryption key
   that was established by the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.3"><h4>6.3.3   Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection</h4></a>

   This combination of confidentiality and message authentication
   services protects the GROUPKEY-PUSH message from man-in-middle and
   connection-hijacking attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.4"><h4>6.3.4   Replay/Reflection Attack Protection</h4></a>

   The GROUPKEY-PUSH message includes a monotonically increasing
   sequence number to protect against replay and reflection attacks.  A
   group member will recognize a replayed message by comparing the
   sequence number to a sliding window, in the same manner as the ESP
   protocol uses sequence numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations SHOULD keep a record of recently received
   GROUPKEY-PUSH messages and reject duplicate messages.  This enables
   an early discard of the replayed messages.
	<a name="section-6.3.5"><h4>6.3.5   Denial of Service Protection</h4></a>

   A cookie pair identifies the security association for the
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message.  The cookies thus serve as a weak form of
   denial-of-service protection for the GROUPKEY-PUSH message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The digital signature used for message authentication has a much
   greater computational cost than a message authentication code and
   could amplify the effects of a denial of service attack on GDOI
   members who process GROUPKEY-PUSH messages.  The added cost of
   digital signatures is justified by the need to prevent GCKS
   impersonation:  If a shared symmetric key were used for
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message authentication, then GCKS source authentication
   would be impossible and any member would be capable of GCKS
   impersonation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The potential of the digital signature amplifying a denial of service
   attack is mitigated by the order of operations a group member takes,
   where the least expensive cryptographic operation is performed first.
   The group member first decrypts the message using a symmetric cipher.
   If it is a validly formed message then the sequence number is checked
   against the replay window.  Only if the sequence number is valid is
   the digital signature verified.  Thus in order for a denial of
   service attack to be mounted, an attacker would need to know both the
   symmetric encryption key used for confidentiality, and a valid
   sequence number.  Generally speaking this means only current group
   members can effectively deploy a denial of service attack.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.6"><h4>6.3.6   Forward Access Control</h4></a>

   If a group management algorithm (such as LKH) is used, forward access
   control may not be ensured in some cases.  This can happen if some
   group members are denied access to the group in the same
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message as new policy and TEKs are delivered to the
   group.  As discussed in Section 4.2.1, forward access control can be
   maintained by sending multiple GROUPKEY-PUSH messages, where the
   group membership changes are sent from the GCKS separate from the new
   policy and TEKs.

Appendix A: Alternate GDOI Phase 1 protocols

   This section describes a manner in which other protocols could be
   used as GDOI Phase 1 protocols in place of the ISAKMP Phase 1
   protocol.  However, they are not specified as a part of this
   document.  A separate document MUST be written in order for another
   protocol to be used as a GDOI Phase 1 protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other possible phase 1 protocols are also described in [GKMARCH].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Any GDOI phase 1 protocol MUST satisfy the requirements specified in
   Section 2 of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A.1.  IKEv2 Phase 1 protocol

   Version 2 of the IKE protocol (IKEv2) is a work in progress [IKEv2].
   That protocol seeks to simplify the IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2
   protocols, and improve the security of the IKE protocol.  An IKEv2
   Phase 1 negotiates an IPSEC SA during phase 1, which was not possible
   in IKE.  However, IKEv2 also defines a phase 2 protocol.  The phase 2
   protocol is protected by the Phase 1, similar in concept to how IKE
   Quick Mode is protected by the IKE Phase 1 protocols in [RFC2409].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IKEv2 may not include a DOI value in the SA payload.  However, since
   GDOI uses a unique port, choice of a phase 2 protocol in the SA
   payload using a GDOI value is not necessary.  It is expected that an
   IKEv2 Phase 1 protocol definition could be run on the GDOI port.  The
   SA payload in the protocol would be specific to GDOI, or omitted if
   not needed at all.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GROUPKEY-PULL protocol would follow the IKEv2 Phase 1 protocol in
   the same manner as described in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A.2.  KINK Protocol

   A work in progress [KINK] has defined a method of encapsulating an
   IKE Quick Mode [RFC2409] encapsulated in Kerberos KRB_AP_REQ and
   KRB_AP_REP payloads.  KINK provides a low-latency, computationally
   inexpensive, easily managed, and cryptographically sound method of
   setting up IPSec security associations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The KINK message format includes a GDOI field in the KINK header.
   The [KINK] document defines the DOI for the IPSEC DOI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A new DOI for KINK could be defined which would encapsulate a
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchange in the Kerberos KRB_AP_REQ and KRB_AP_REP
   payloads.  As such, GDOI would benefit from the computational
   efficiencies of KINK.
