                  <h2>Status of This Memo</h2>

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes domain-name-based service principal names and
   the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API).  Internationalization of
   the GSS-API is also covered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names,
   but using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in
   addition to a hostname.  The primary purpose of domain-based names is
   to provide a measure of protection to applications that utilize
   insecure service discovery protocols.  This is achieved by providing
   a way to name clustered services after the "domain" which they
   service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's
   servers based on authentication of their service names.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Some applications need to discover the names of servers for a
   specific resource.  Some common methods for server discovery are
   insecure, e.g., queries for DNS [RFC1035] SRV resource records
   [RFC2782] without using DNSSEC [RFC4033], and are subject to attacks
   whereby a client can be re-directed to incorrect and possibly
   malicious servers.  A client may even be re-directed to a server that
   has credentials for itself and thus may authenticate itself to the
   client, and yet it could be incorrect or malicious (because it has
   been compromised, say).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Domain-based names allow for GSS-API [RFC2743] initiator applications
   (clients) to authorize acceptor principals (servers) to serve the
   resource for which the client used insecure server discovery without
   either securing the server discovery method or requiring an
   additional protocol for server authorization.  That is, either a
   discovered server has credentials for authenticating the domain-based
   service names that it is intended to respond to, or it does not.
   Availability of valid credentials for authenticating domain-based
   names embodies the authorization of a given server to a domain-wide
   service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A domain-based name consists of three required elements:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  a service name

   o  a domain name

   o  a hostname

   The domain name and the hostname should be Domain Name System (DNS)
   names, though domain-based names could be used in non-DNS
   environments.  Because of the use of DNS names we must also provide
   for internationalization of the GSS-API.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that domain-based naming isn't new.  According to a report to
   the KITTEN WG mailing list, there exists at least one implementation
   of LDAP which uses domain-based service naming, and the DIGEST-MD5
   HTTP / Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism
   [RFC2831] describes a similar notion.  (See section 2.1.2 of
   [RFC2831] for a description of the "serv-name" field of the digest-
   response.)
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Name Type OID</h3></a>

   The IANA has recorded the following new name-type OID in IANA's "SMI
   Security for Name System Designators Codes (nametypes)" registry:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5 gss-domain-based-services [RFC5178]

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Name Type OID and Symbolic Name</h3></a>

   This document creates a new GSS-API name-type, with a symbolic name
   of "GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE" and this OID:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   {iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) nametypes(6) gss-<br>
   domain-based(5)}<br>


	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Query and Display Syntaxes</h2></a>

   There is a single name syntax for domain-based names.  It is
   expressed using the ABNF [RFC5234].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         domain-based-name = service "@" domain "@" hostname

         hostname          = domain

         domain            = sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain)

         sub-domain        = Let-dig [Ldh-str]

         Let-dig           = ALPHA / DIGIT

         Ldh-str           = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" ) Let-dig

   Where <service> is defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC2743].  Other rules
   not defined above are defined in Appendix B.1 of [RFC5234].
	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Examples of Domain-Based Names</h3></a>

   These examples are not normative:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  ldap@somecompany.example@ds1.somecompany.example

   o  nfs@somecompany.example@nfsroot1.somecompany.example

   The .example top-level domain is used here in accordance with
   [RFC2606].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Internationalization (I18N) Considerations</h2></a>

   We introduce new versions of GSS_Import_name() and GSS_Display_name()
   to better support Unicode.  Additionally, we provide for the use of
   ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE)-encoded DNS in the non-
   internationalized interfaces [RFC3490].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Importing Internationalized Names</h3></a>

   When the input_name_type parameter is the
   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE OID, then GSS_Import_name()
   implementations and GSS-API mechanisms MUST accept ACE-encoded
   internationalized domain names in the hostname and domain name slots
   of the given domain-based name string.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Support for non-ASCII internationalized domain names SHOULD also be
   provided through a new function, GSS_Import_name_utf8(), that
   operates exactly like GSS_Import_name() (with the same input and
   output parameters and behavior), except that it MUST accept
   internationalized domain names both as UTF-8 strings and as ACE-
   encoded strings via its input_name_string argument.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Displaying Internationalized Names</h3></a>

   Implementations of GSS_Display_name() MUST only output US-ASCII or
   ACE-encoded internationalized domain names in the hostname and domain
   name slots of domain-based names (or mechanism names (MN) that
   conform to the mechanism's form for domain-based names).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Support for non-ASCII internationalized domain names SHOULD also be
   provided through a new function, GSS_Display_name_utf8(), that
   operates exactly like GSS_Display_name() (with the same input and
   output parameters and behavior), except that it outputs UTF-8 strings
   via its name_string output argument.  GSS_Display_name_utf8() MUST
   NOT output ACE-encoded internationalized domain names.
	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Application Protocol Examples</h2></a>

   The following examples are not normative.  They describe how the
   authors envision two applications' use of domain-based names.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   NFSv4 Domain-Wide Namespace Root Server Discovery</h3></a>

   Work is ongoing to provide a method for constructing domain-wide
   NFSv4 [RFC3530] filesystem namespaces where there is a single "root"
   with one or more servers (replicas) and multiple filesystems glued
   into the namespace through use of "referrals".  Clients could then
   construct a "global" namespace through use of the DNS domain
   hierarchy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Here, clients would always know, from context, when they need to find
   the root servers for a given DNS domain.  Root server discovery would
   be performed using DNS SRV RR lookups, without using DNSSEC where
   DNSSEC has not been deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203] for security, NFSv4 clients would use
   domain-based names to ensure that the servers named in the SRV RRs
   are in fact authorized to be the NFSv4 root servers for the target
   domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   LDAP Server Discovery</h3></a>

   LDAP clients using the GSS-API through SASL would also benefit from
   use of domain-based names to protect server discovery through
   insecure DNS SRV RR lookups, much as described above.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unlike NFSv4 clients, not all LDAP clients always know from context
   when they should use domain-based names.  That's because existing
   clients may use host-based naming to authenticate servers discovered
   through SRV RR lookups.  Changing such clients to use domain-based
   naming when domain-based acceptor credentials have not been deployed
   to LDAP servers, or when LDAP servers have not been modified to allow
   use of domain-based naming, would break interoperability.  That is,
   there is a legacy server interoperability issue here.  Therefore,
   LDAP clients may require additional configuration at deployment time
   to enable (or disable) use of domain-based naming.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note: whether SASL [RFC4422] or its GSS-API bridges [RFC4752] [GS2]
   require updates in order allow use of domain-based names is not
   relevant to the theory of how domain-based naming would protect LDAP
   clients' server discovery.
	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Use of GSS-API domain-based names may not be negotiable by some GSS-
   API mechanisms, and some acceptors may not support GSS-API domain-
   based names.  In such cases, the initiators are left to fall back on
   the use of host-based names, so the initiators MUST also verify that
   the acceptor's host-based name is authorized to provide the given
   service for the domain that the initiator had wanted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above security consideration also applies to all GSS-API
   initiators who lack support for domain-based service names.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that, as with all service names, the mere existence of a domain-
   based service name conveys meaningful information that may be used by
   initiators for making authorization decisions; therefore,
   administrators of distributed authentication services should be aware
   of the significance of the service names for which they create
   acceptor credentials.
