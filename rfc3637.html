   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h2></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   The objects defined in this memo are used in conjunction with objects
   defined in the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863], the SONET/SDH
   Interface MIB [RFC3592], and the 802.3 MAU MIB [RFC3636] to manage
   the Ethernet Wide Area Network (WAN) Interface Sublayer (WIS) defined
   in [802.3ae].  The WIS contains functions to perform OC-192c/VC-4-64c
   framing and scrambling.  It resides between the Physical Coding
   Sublayer (PCS) and the Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) sublayer
   within a 10GBASE-W 10 Gb/s WAN-compatible physical layer device (PHY)
   and may be used in conjunction with any of the PCS, PMA, and Physical
   Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayers defined in [802.3ae] for 10GBASE-W
   PHYs.  Three types of 10GBASE-W PHYs are defined, distinguished by
   the type of optics employed:  10GBASE-SW, 10GBASE-LW, and 10GBASE-EW.
   The objects defined in this memo may be used to manage an Ethernet
   interface employing any type of 10GBASE-W PHY.  They do not apply to
   any other kind of interface.  In particular, they do not apply to
   so-called Ethernet Line Terminating Equipment (ELTE) residing within
   a SONET network element that uses the 10GBASE-W PMA/PMD sublayers but
   otherwise acts as SONET Line Terminating Equipment (LTE).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The objects presented here -- along with those incorporated by
   reference from the Interfaces Group MIB, the SONET/SDH Interface MIB,
   and the 802.3 MAU MIB -- are intended to provide exact
   representations of the mandatory attributes in the oWIS managed
   object class (i.e., the members of the pWISBasic package) defined in
   Clause 30 and Annex 30A of [802.3ae].  They are also intended to
   provide approximate representations of the optional attributes (i.e.,
   the members of the pWISOptional package).  Some objects with no
   analogues in oWIS are defined to support WIS testing features
   required by Clause 50 of [802.3ae].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Relationship to the SONET/SDH Interface MIB</h3></a>

   Since the Ethernet WAN Interface Sublayer was designed to be SONET-
   compatible, information similar to that provided by most of the
   members of the oWIS managed object class is available from objects
   defined in the SONET-MIB [RFC3592].  Thus, the MIB module defined in
   this memo is a sparse augmentation of the SONET-MIB -- in other
   words, every table defined here is an extension of some table in the
   SONET-MIB -- and its compliance statement REQUIRES that an agent
   implementing the objects defined in this memo also implement the
   relevant SONET-MIB objects.  That includes all objects required by
   sonetCompliance2 as well as some that it leaves optional.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that some of the objects incorporated by reference
   from the SONET-MIB -- specifically, the threshold objects and
   interval counter objects -- provide only approximate representations
   of the corresponding oWIS attributes, as detailed in Section 3.6.  An
   alternative approach would have been to define new objects to exactly
   match the oWIS definitions.  That approach was rejected because the
   SONET-MIB objects are already used in deployed systems to manage the
   SONET sublayers of ATM over SONET and PPP over SONET interfaces, and
   it was deemed undesirable to use a different scheme to manage the
   SONET sublayers of 10 Gb/s WAN-compatible Ethernet interfaces.  Note
   that the approach adopted by this memo requires no hardware support
   beyond that mandated by [802.3ae] subclause 50.3.11.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Relationship to the Ethernet-like Interface MIB</h3></a>

   An interface which includes the Ethernet WIS is, by definition, an
   Ethernet-like interface, and an agent implementing the objects
   defined in this memo MUST implement the objects required by the
   dot3Compliance2 compliance statement in the EtherLike-MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Relationship to the 802.3 MAU MIB</h3></a>

   Support for the mauModIfCompl3 compliance statement of the MAU-MIB
   [RFC3636] is REQUIRED for all Ethernet-like interfaces.  The MAU-MIB
   is needed in order to allow applications to control and/or determine
   the media type in use.  That is important for devices than can
   support both the 10GBASE-R 10 Gb/s LAN format (which does not include
   the WIS) and the 10GBASE-W 10 Gb/s WAN format (which does include the
   WIS).  The MAU-MIB also provides the means to put a device in standby
   mode or to reset it;  the latter may be used to re-initialize the
   WIS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Use of the ifTable</h3></a>

   This section specifies how the ifTable, as defined in [RFC2863], is
   used for the Ethernet WIS application.
	<a name="section-3.4.1"><h4>3.4.1   Layering Model</h4></a>

   Ethernet interfaces that employ the WIS are layered as defined in
   [802.3ae].  The corresponding use of the ifTable [RFC2863] is shown
   in the figure below.

   The exact configuration and multiplexing of the layers is maintained
   in the ifStackTable [RFC2863] and in the ifInvStackTable [RFC2864].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4.2"><h4>3.4.2   Use of ifTable for LLC Layer/MAC Layer/Reconciliation</h4></a>
         Sublayer/Physical Coding Sublayer

   The ifTable MUST be used as specified in [RFC3635] and [RFC3636] for
   the LLC Layer/MAC Layer/Reconciliation Sublayer/Physical Coding
   Sublayer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4.3"><h4>3.4.3   Use of ifTable for SONET/SDH Path Layer</h4></a>

   The ifTable MUST be used as specified in [RFC3592] for the SONET/SDH

   reports a value of 4294967295.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4.4"><h4>3.4.4   Use of ifTable for SONET/SDH Medium/Section/Line Layer</h4></a>

   The ifTable MUST be used as specified in [RFC3592] for the SONET/SDH
   Medium/Section/Line Layer.  The value of ifHighSpeed is set to 9953.
   ifSpeed reports a value of 4294967295.
	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5   SONET/SDH Terminology</h3></a>

   The SONET/SDH terminology used in [802.3ae] is mostly the same as in
   [RFC3592], but there are a few differences.  In those cases the
   definitions in [802.3ae] take precedence.  The specific differences
   are as follows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unequipped
       This defect is not defined by [802.3ae].  An implementation that
       supports it SHOULD report it by setting the sonetPathUnequipped
       bit in the appropriate instance of sonetPathCurrentStatus.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Signal Label Mismatch
       This defect is called Payload Label Mismatch (PLM) in [802.3ae].
       It is reported by setting both the sonetPathSignalLabelMismatch
       bit in the appropriate instance of sonetPathCurrentStatus
       (defined in [RFC3592]) and the etherWisPathPLM bit in the
       corresponding instance of etherWisPathCurrentStatus (defined
       below).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Loss of Codegroup Delineation
       [802.3ae] defines Loss of Codegroup Delineation (LCD) as
       occurring when the Physical Coding Sublayer is unable to locate
       64B/66B code group boundaries.  There is no analogous defect
       defined in [RFC3592].  It is reported by setting the
       etherWisPathLCD bit in the appropriate instance of the object
       etherWisPathCurrentStatus defined below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   STS-Path Remote Defect Indication
       [802.3ae] mandates the use of ERDI-P (Enhanced Remote Defect
       Indication - Path) defined in [T1.231] to signal remote server
       defects (triggered by path AIS or path LOP) and remote payload
       defects (triggered by Payload Label Mismatch or Loss of Codegroup
       Delineation).  [RFC3592] defines the one-bit RDI-P (Remote Defect
       Indication - Path), which signals remote server detects (i.e.,
       path AIS and path LOP) only.  An implementation of the MIB module
       defined in this memo MUST set the sonetPathSTSRDI bit in the
       appropriate instance of sonetPathCurrentStatus when it receives
       an ERDI-P server defect indication from the remote end.  Both
       ERDI-P payload defects and ERDI-P server defects are reported in
       the object etherWisFarEndPathCurrentStatus defined below.
   Path Coding Violations
       In [802.3ae] the path layer CV count is based on block errors and
       not BIP-8 errors, i.e., it is incremented only once for each B3
       byte that indicates incorrect parity, regardless of the number of
       bits in error.  Note that Section 8.4.5.1 of [T1.231] allows
       either path BIP-8 errors or path block errors to be used for the
       path layer error count.

   them.  Note that the MDIO interface is optional;  however, if it is
   not implemented, then the capabilities of the required register
   subset must be provided by other means.

	<a name="section-3.8"><h3>3.8   Structure of the MIB Module</h3></a>

   Four tables are defined in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.8.1"><h4>3.8.1   etherWisDeviceTable</h4></a>

   The purpose of this table is to define managed objects to control the
   WIS test pattern mode.  These objects are required to support
   mandatory and optional WIS test features specified in [802.3ae]
   subclause 50.3.8.
   The etherWisDeviceTable is a sparse augmentation of the
   sonetMediumTable of the SONET-MIB -- in other words, for each entry
   in the etherWisDeviceTable there MUST be an entry in the
   sonetMediumTable and the same ifIndex value MUST be used for both
   entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.8.2"><h4>3.8.2   etherWisSectionCurrentTable</h4></a>

   The purpose of this table is to define managed objects for the
   transmitted and received section trace messages (J0 byte).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The etherWisSectionCurrentTable is a sparse augmentation of the
   sonetSectionCurrentTable of the SONET-MIB -- in other words, for each
   entry in the etherWisSectionCurrentTable there MUST be an entry in
   the sonetSectionCurrentTable and the same ifIndex value MUST be used
   for both entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.8.3"><h4>3.8.3   etherWisPathCurrentTable</h4></a>

   The purpose of this table is to define managed objects for the
   current WIS path layer status and for the transmitted and received
   path trace messages (J1 byte).  The path layer status object is
   provided because the WIS supports some near-end path status
   conditions that are not reported in sonetPathCurrentStatus.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The etherWisPathCurrentTable is a sparse augmentation of the
   sonetPathCurrentTable of the SONET-MIB -- in other words, for each
   entry in the etherWisPathCurrentTable there MUST be an entry in the
   sonetPathCurrentTable and the same ifIndex value MUST be used for
   both entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.8.4"><h4>3.8.4   etherWisFarEndPathCurrentTable</h4></a>

   The purpose of this table is to define a managed object for the
   current status of the far end of the path.  This object is provided
   because the WIS supports some far-end path status conditions that are
   not reported in sonetPathCurrentStatus.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The etherWisFarEndPathCurrentTable is a sparse augmentation of the
   sonetFarEndPathCurrentTable of the SONET-MIB -- in other words, for
   each entry in the etherWisFarEndPathCurrentTable there MUST be an

   Ethernet Task Force.
	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are five managed objects defined in this MIB module that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write: etherWisDeviceTxTestPatternMode,
   etherWisDeviceRxTestPatternMode, etherWisDeviceRxTestPatternErrors,
   etherWisSectionCurrentJ0Transmitted, and
   etherWisPathCurrentJ1Transmitted.  Writing to these objects can have
   the following potentially disruptive effects on network operation:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  changing the transmit or receive test pattern mode or modifying
      the accumulated error count from a PRBS31 pattern test on an
      administratively disabled 10GBASE-W interface, which can
      interfere with an in-progress pattern test;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  modifying the transmitted section trace and/or path trace
      message on an operational 10GBASE-W interface, which can cause
      connectivity alarms to be raised at the remote of the link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

Appendix A:  Collection of Performance Data Using WIS MDIO Registers

   The purpose of this appendix is to illustrate how the WIS MDIO
   registers specified in [802.3ae] subclause 45.2.2 (and more
   specifically the subset required by [802.3ae] subclause 50.3.11) can
   be used to collect performance data either according to the
   conventions adopted by this document or according to the conventions
   specified in [802.3ae] Clause 30.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For an agent implementing the SNMP managed objects required by this
   document the first step in collecting WIS performance data would be
   to poll the 10G WIS status 3 register and the various error count
   registers (10G WIS section BIP error count, 10G WIS line BIP errors,
   10G WIS far end line BIP errors, 10G WIS path block error count, and
   10G WIS far end path block error count) once per second.  The 10G WIS
   status 3 register bits are all latched until read and so would
   indicate whether a given defect occurred any time during the previous
   second.  The error count registers roll over modulo 2^16 or 2^32, and
   so to find the number of errors within the previous second the agent
   would need to subtract (modulo 2^16 or 2^32) the current reading from
   the reading taken one second ago.  Armed with that information, the
   agent could determine for any layer whether the one second interval
   was an errored second, a severely errored second (that requires
   comparison with a threshold unless a defect is present), or a
   severely errored frame second.  Determining whether a given second is
   or is not part of unavailable time requires additional logic;  the
   most straightforward and accurate method is the delay-line approach
   outlined in Appendix A of [RFC3592].  With that information available
   the agent would be able to determine by how much each current count
   should be incremented (including effects of inhibiting).
   Implementations that conform to [T1.231] would end each 15-minute
   interval on time-of-day clock 1/4 hour boundaries;  if the delay-line
   approach is used then a time-of-day timestamp would accompany the
   one-second statistics.  At the end of each interval the current
   registers would be pushed onto the history stack and then would be
   cleared.  The xyxIntervalValidData flags would be set to False(2) if<br>
   the number of samples was not between 890 and 910 or, in the case of
   far-end counts, if a near-end defect occurred during the
   just-completed interval (see [T1.231] Section 9.1.2.2 for details).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An agent implementing the [802.3ae] Clause 30 oWIS objects could also
   start by polling the 10G WIS status 3 register and the various error
   count registers to find the defects and error counts for the previous
   second, and it could determine the number of errors and whether the
   second was an errored second, a severely errored second, or a
   severely errored frame second in the same manner as above.  The rest
   of the process would simply be to increment the generalized non-
   resetable counters without consideration of any inhibiting rules.
