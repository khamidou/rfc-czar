   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Definition of RMON</h2></a>

   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing and/or
   monitoring a network.  Often these remote probes are stand-alone
   devices and devote significant internal resources for the sole
   purpose of managing a network.  An organization may employ many of
   these devices, up to one per network segment, to manage its internet.
   In addition, these devices may be used to manage a geographically
   remote network such as for a network management support center of a
   service provider to manage a client network, or for the central
   support organization of an enterprise to manage a remote site.
   When the work on the RMON documents was started, this device-oriented
   definition of RMON was taken quite literally, as RMON devices were
   purpose-built probes and dedicated to implementing the RMON MIB
   modules.  Soon, cards were introduced that added RMON capability into
   a network hub, switch or router.  RMON also began to appear as a
   software capability that was added to the software of certain network
   equipment, as well as software applications that could run on servers
   or clients.  Despite the variety of these approaches, the RMON
   capability in each serves as a dedicated network management resource
   available for activities ranging from long-term data collection and
   analysis or for ad-hoc firefighting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the beginning, most, but not all, of RMON's capabilities were
   based on the promiscuous capture of packets on a network segment or
   segments.  Over time, that mixture included more and more
   capabilities that did not depend on promiscuous packet capture.
   Today, some of the newest documents added to the RMON framework allow
   multiple techniques of data gathering, where promiscuous packet
   capture is just one of several implementation options.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Goals of RMON</h2></a>

      o  Offline Operation

         There are sometimes conditions when a management station will
         not be in constant contact with its remote monitoring devices.
         This is sometimes by design in an attempt to lower
         communications costs (especially when communicating over a WAN
         or dialup link), or by accident as network failures affect the
         communications between the management station and the probe.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For this reason, RMON allows a probe to be configured to
         perform diagnostics and to collect statistics continuously,
         even when communication with the management station may not be
         possible or efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
         the management station when an exceptional condition occurs.
         Thus, even in circumstances where communication between
         management station and probe is not continuous, fault,
         performance, and configuration information may be continuously
         accumulated and communicated to the management station
         conveniently and efficiently.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Proactive Monitoring

         Given the resources available on the monitor, it is potentially
         helpful for it to continuously run diagnostics and to log
         network performance.  The monitor is always available at the
         onset of any failure.  It can notify the management station of
         the failure and can store historical statistical information
         about the failure.  This historical information can be played
         back by the management station in an attempt to perform further
         diagnosis into the cause of the problem.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Problem Detection and Reporting

         The monitor can be configured to recognize conditions, most
         notably error conditions, and to continuously check for them.
         When one of these conditions occurs, the event may be logged,
         and management stations may be notified in a number of ways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Value Added Data

         Because a remote monitoring device represents a network
         resource dedicated exclusively to network management functions,
         and because it is located directly on the monitored portion of
         the network, the remote network monitoring device has the
         opportunity to add significant value to the data it collects.
         For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the network that
         generate the most traffic or errors, the probe can give the
         management station precisely the information it needs to solve
         a class of problems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  Multiple Managers

         An organization may have multiple management stations for
         different units of the organization, for different functions
         (e.g., engineering and operations), and in an attempt to
         provide disaster recovery.  Because environments with multiple
         management stations are common, the remote network monitoring
         device has to deal with more than one management station,
         potentially using its resources concurrently.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   RMON Documents</h2></a>

   The RMON Framework includes a number of documents.  Each document
   that makes up the RMON framework defines some new useful behavior
   (i.e., an application) and managed objects that configure, control
   and monitor that behavior.  This section lists those documents and
   describes the role of each.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One of the key ways to differentiate the various RMON MIB modules is
   by noting at which layer they operate.  Because the RMON MIB modules
   take measurements and present aggregates of those measurements, there
   are 2 criteria to quantify for each MIB:
      1. At which layers does the MIB take measurements?

         For example, the RMON MIB measures data-link layer attributes
         (e.g., packets, bytes, errors), while the APM MIB measures
         application layer attributes (e.g., response time).  Supporting
         measurement at higher layers requires analysis deeper into the
         packet and many application layer measurements require stateful
         flow analysis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      2. At which layers does the MIB aggregate measurements?

         This criteria notes the granularity of aggregation.  For
         example, the RMON MIB aggregates its measurements to the link,
         hardware address, or hardware address pair - all data-link
         concepts.  In contrast, the RMON-2 MIB takes the same data-link
         metrics (packets, bytes, errors) and aggregates them based on
         network address, transport protocol, or application protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that a MIB may take measurements at one level while aggregating
   at different levels.  Also note that a MIB may function at multiple
   levels.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the measurement layers and
   aggregation layers for each MIB.

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   RMON-1</h3></a>

   The RMON-1 standard [RFC2819] is focused at layer 2 and provides
   link-layer statistics aggregated in a variety of ways.  In addition,
   it provides the generation of alarms when thresholds are crossed, as
   well as the ability to filter and capture packet contents.  The
   components of RMON-1 are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Ethernet Statistics Group

         The ethernet statistics group contains statistics measured by
         the probe for each monitored Ethernet interface on this device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The History Control Group

         The history control group controls the periodic statistical
         sampling of data from various types of network media.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Ethernet History Group

         The ethernet history group records periodic statistical samples
         from an ethernet network and stores them for later retrieval.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Alarm Group

         The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
         variables in the probe and compares them to previously
         configured thresholds.  If the monitored variable crosses a
         threshold, an event is generated.  A hysteresis mechanism is
         implemented to limit the generation of alarms.
      The Host Group

         The host group contains statistics associated with each host
         discovered on the network.  This group discovers hosts on the
         network by keeping a list of source and destination MAC
         Addresses seen in good packets promiscuously received from the
         network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The HostTopN Group

         The hostTopN group is used to prepare reports that describe the
         hosts that top a list ordered by one of their statistics.  The
         available statistics are samples of one of their base
         statistics over an interval specified by the management
         station.  Thus, these statistics are rate based.  The
         management station also selects how many such hosts are
         reported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Matrix Group

         The matrix group stores statistics for conversations between
         sets of two MAC addresses.  As the device detects a new
         conversation, it creates a new entry in its tables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Filter Group

         The filter group allows packets to be matched by a filter
         equation.  These matched packets form a data stream that may be
         captured or may generate events.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Packet Capture Group

         The Packet Capture group allows packets to be captured after
         they flow through a channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Event Group

         The event group controls the generation and notification of
         events from this device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB</h3></a>

   Some of the functions defined in the RMON-1 MIB were defined specific
   to Ethernet media.  In order to operate the functions on Token Ring
   Media, new objects needed to be defined in the Token Ring Extensions
   to RMON MIB [RFC1513].  In addition, this MIB defines additional
   objects that provide monitoring functions unique to Token Ring.
   The components of the Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Token Ring Statistics Groups

         The Token Ring statistics groups contain current utilization
         and error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two
         groups, the Token Ring Mac-Layer Statistics Group and the Token
         Ring Promiscuous Statistics Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer
         Statistics Group collects information from the Mac Layer,
         including error reports for the ring and ring utilization of
         the Mac Layer.  The Token Ring Promiscuous Statistics Group
         collects utilization statistics from data packets collected
         promiscuously.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Token Ring History Groups

         The Token Ring History Groups contain historical utilization
         and error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two
         groups, the Token Ring Mac-Layer History Group and the Token
         Ring Promiscuous History Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer
         History Group collects information from the Mac Layer,
         including error reports for the ring and ring utilization of
         the Mac Layer.  The Token Ring Promiscuous History Group
         collects utilization statistics from data packets collected
         promiscuously.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Token Ring Ring Station Group

         The Token Ring Ring Station Group contains statistics and
         status information associated with each Token Ring station on
         the local ring.  In addition, this group provides status
         information for each ring being monitored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group

         The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group provides the order of
         the stations on monitored rings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group

         The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group manages token ring
         stations through active means.  Any station on a monitored ring
         may be removed or have configuration information downloaded
         from it.
      The Token Ring Source Routing Group

         The Token Ring Source Routing Group contains utilization
         statistics derived from source routing information optionally
         present in token ring packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   The RMON-2 MIB</h3></a>

   The RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] extends the architecture defined in RMON-1,
   primarily by extending RMON analysis up to the application layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The components of the RMON-2 MIB are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Protocol Directory Group

         Every RMON-2 implementation will have the capability to parse
         certain types of packets and identify their protocol type at
         multiple levels.  The protocol directory presents an inventory
         of those protocol types the probe is capable of monitoring, and
         allows the addition, deletion, and configuration of protocol
         types in this list.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Protocol Distribution Group

         This function controls the collection of packet and octet
         counts for any or all protocols detected on a given interface.
         An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth
         allocation utilized by different protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Address Mapping Group

         This function lists MAC address to network address bindings
         discovered by the probe and on which interface they were last
         seen.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Network Layer Host Group

         This function counts the amount of traffic sent from and to
         each network address discovered by the probe.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Network Layer Matrix Group

         This function counts the amount of traffic sent between each
         pair of network addresses discovered by the probe.
      Application Layer Host Group

         This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent
         from and to each network address discovered by the probe.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Application Layer Matrix

         This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent
         between each pair of network addresses discovered by the probe.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      User History

         This function allows an NMS to request that certain variables
         on the probe be periodically polled and for a time-series to be
         stored of the polled values.  This builds a user-configurable
         set of variables to be monitored (not to be confused with data

      (SMON MIB)

   Switches have become pervasive in today's networks as a form of
   broadcast media.  SMON [RFC2613] provides RMON-like functions for the
   monitoring of switched networks.
   Switches today differ from standard shared media protocols because:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1) Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This MAY be caused by the
         switch architecture or by the connection-oriented nature of the
         data.  This means, therefore, that monitoring non-broadcast
         traffic needs to be considered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      2) Monitoring the multiple entry and exit points from a Switching
         device requires a vast amount of resources - memory and CPU,
         and aggregation of the data in logical packets of information,
         determined by the application needs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      3) Switching incorporates logical segmentation such as Virtual
         LANs (VLANs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      4) Switching incorporates packet prioritization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      5) Data across the switch fabric can be in the form of cells.
         Like RMON, SMON is only concerned with the monitoring of
         packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Differences such as these make monitoring difficult.  The SMON MIB

         802.1q VLANs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      smonPrioStats

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      portCopyConfig

         Many network switches provide the capability to make a copy of
         traffic seen on one port and sending it out to another port for
         management purposes.  This occurs in addition to any copying
         performed during the normal forwarding behavior of the switch.

   Many network switches contain hundreds of ports, many with only one

   to sort the interfaces by one of the parameters (e.g., to find the
   most highly utilized interface).  If the switch contains many
   interfaces it can be expensive and time consuming to download
   information for all interfaces to sort it on the NMS.  Instead, the

   The second of the RMON infrastructure components is the Protocol

   by an object called the protocolDirID.  The protocolDirID is a
   hierarchically formatted OCTET STRING that globally identifies
   individual protocol encapsulations.  A protocol descriptor macro has
   been defined in RFC 2895 [RFC2895] to describe the various protocol
   layers supported in the protocolDirID protocol hierarchy.  The
   protocolDirID is defined as a tree built up from successive protocol

   which data is to be collected.  The DataSource is an object
   identifier that identifies one of three types of data sources:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ifIndex.<I>

         Traditional RMON dataSources.  Called 'port-based' for
         ifType.<I> not equal to 'propVirtual(53)'.  <I> is the ifIndex<br>
         value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      smonVlanDataSource.<V>

         A dataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN' and
         is called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource.  <V> is the VLAN ID as
         defined by the IEEE 802.1Q standard.  The value is between 1
         and 4094 inclusive, and it represents an 802.1Q VLAN-ID with a
         global scope within a given bridged domain, as defined by
         802.1Q.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      entPhysicalEntry.<N>

         A dataSource of this form refers to a physical entity within
         the agent and is called an 'entity-based' dataSource.  <N> is
         the value of the entPhysicalIndex in the entPhysicalTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   Capabilities</h3></a>

   Probe Capabilities objects have been introduced in the RMON MIB
   modules with the goal of helping applications determine the
   capabilities of the different probes in the domain.  These objects
   use a BITS syntax (with the exception of some of the objects in the
   TPM and SSPM MIBs), and list in an explicit manner the MIB groups
   supported by the probe, as well as functional capabilities of the
   specific RMON agents.  By reading the values of these objects, it is
   possible for applications to know which RMON functions are usable
   without going through a trial-and-error process that can result in
   loss of time and bandwidth in the operational flow.  These objects
   have the MAX-ACCESS of read-only, which defines their use as an
   indication of what is supported by a probe, and not a means to
   configure the probe for operational modes.  An RMON agent SHOULD
   initiate the capabilities objects at agent initialization and SHOULD
   NOT modify the objects during operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The probeCapabilities object in the RMON-2 MIB describes the
   capabilities of probes that support RMON, Token-Ring RMON and RMON-2.
   The smonCapabilities object in the SMON MIB describes the SMON-
   specific capabilities of probes that support the SMON MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The dataSourceCapsTable in the SMON MIB defines the capabilities of
   the SMON data sources on probes that support the RMON MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The interfaceTopNCaps object in the Interface TopN MIB defines the
   sorting capabilities supported by an agent that supports the
   Interface TopN MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The dsmonCapabilities object in the DSMON MIB provides an indication
   of the DSMON groups supported by an agent that supports the DSMON
   MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables, which show the
   measurement protocol and metric capabilities of an agent that
   supports the TPM MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The sspmCapabilitiesTable indicates whether a device supporting the
   SSPM MIB supports SSPM configuration of the corresponding
   AppLocalIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The hcAlarmCapabilities object provides an indication of the high
   capacity alarm capabilities supported by an agent that supports the
   HC-Alarm MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6   Control Tables</h3></a>

   Due to the complex nature of the available functions in the RMON MIB
   modules, these functions often need user configuration.  In many
   cases, the function requires parameters to be set up for a data
   collection operation.  The operation can proceed only after these
   parameters are fully set up.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Many functional groups in the RMON MIBs have one or more tables in
   which to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables in
   which to place the results of the operation.  The control tables are
   typically read-write in nature, while the data tables are typically
   read-only.  Because the parameters in the control table often
   describe resulting data in the data table, many of the parameters can
   be modified only when the control entry is invalid.  Thus, the method
   for modifying these parameters is to invalidate the control entry,
   causing its deletion and the deletion of any associated data entries,
   and then create a new control entry with the proper parameters.
   Deleting the control entry also gives a convenient method for
   reclaiming the resources used by the associated data.
   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be
   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the memory
   and computation resources that a function requires.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two facilities are used to ease cooperation between multiple managers
   as they create and use control tables.  The first is the use of
   EntryStatus or RowStatus objects that guarantee that two managers can
   avoid creating the same control entry.  The second is the use of
   OwnerString objects in control tables that provides the following
   benefits:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1. Provides information to facilitate sharing of already existing
         control entries instead of creating a new but identical entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      2. Provides information to allow the ultimate human owners of
         control entries to identify each other so they can cooperate in
         cases of conflict over resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      3. Provides information to allow software to identify control
         entries that it owns but has forgotten about (e.g., due to a
         crash or other error) so that it can re-use or free them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      4. Provides information to allow an administrator to make an
         informed decision to override someone else's control entry when
         circumstances make it necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      5. Provides information to identify control entries that are set
         up automatically when the device starts up.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   See the RMON MIB [RFC2819] for further information on the use of
   control tables, EntryStatus/RowStatus, and OwnerStrings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Relationship of the SSPM MIB with the APM and TPM MIBs</h2></a>

   While APM and TPM may monitor actual traffic generated by end-users
   on the network, they may also monitor synthetically generated
   traffic.  The SSPM MIB provides a mechanism for the generation of
   synthetic traffic but no mechanism for monitoring - the task of
   monitoring the generated traffic is deferred to the APM and TPM MIBs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 5 shows an overview of the components of the SSPM MIB
   architecture, including the roles played by the APM and TPM MIBs.
   The RMON documents address the "Control-Level" in this diagram and
   some aspects of the "Synchronization Control-Level".  The underlying
   "Instrumentation-Level" is implementation dependent and outside the
   domain of the RMON specifications.

           Figure 5: An SSPM Performance Monitoring System

   It is the responsibility of the network management application to
   coordinate the individual aspects of the performance management
   system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Within the APM, TPM, and SSPM set of RMON MIB modules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      +  APM MIB [APM] is responsible for the aspects of the "Monitoring
         Metrics Control" directly related to the end-user's perceived
         application-level performance.  The APM MIB also handles
         aspects of "Data Reduction Control" and "Reports".  Finally,
         when TPM MIB relies upon the control tables in the APM MIB for
         its own control, then APM MIB is providing some aspects of
         "Synchronization Control" of the reports from these two MIBs.
      +  TPM MIB [TPM] is responsible for the aspects of the "Monitoring
         Metrics Control".  TPM MIB also handles aspects of "Data
         Reduction Control" and "Reports" related to sub-application-
         level transactions.  Synchronization control with APM MIB is
         provided by opting to rely on the APM MIB control tables within
         the TPM MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      +  SSPM MIB [SSPM] is responsible for the "Traffic Generation
         Control" in the event that synthetic traffic is to be
         monitored.  The other, most common, option is to monitor
         natural, user-generated traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "Monitor Metrics Control" is essentially hard-coded in the APM
   MIB.  Within the TPM MIB, a metrics table is used to identify the
   metrics monitored within a specific implementation of the TPM MIB.
   The "Data Reduction Control" is essentially hard-coded within the MIB
   structure of the APM MIB and the TPM MIB.  These MIBs strictly
   specify the statistics to be reported within a set of report tables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both the TPM MIB and the SSPM MIB rely upon the APM MIB's
   appLocalIndex to specify the application being monitored or
   generated.  The APM MIB provides the end-user view of the application
   performance, e.g., the Whois transaction time.  The TPM MIB, through
   its tpmTransMetricDirTable, identifies a set of sub-application level
   transactions and their metrics, which are associated with the
   application.  E.g., an implementation of the TPM MIB could report the
   DNS lookup time, the TCP connect time (to the Whois Server), the
   Whois Req/Resp download time.  The SSPM MIB could be configured to
   generate synthetically, these Whois transactions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The testing model then is to first configure the traffic generation
   instrumentation through the SSPM MIB control function.  This defines
   aspects of the synthetic traffic such as application type, targets,
   etc.  Once the traffic generation is configured, the network
   management application can setup the monitoring instrumentation
   through the APM MIB and TPM MIB.  These control the reporting
   periods, the type of data aggregation, etc.  Once the tests are
   complete, the network management application retrieves the reports
   from the monitoring metrics control MIBs, e.g., APM MIB and TPM MIB.
