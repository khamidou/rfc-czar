                SITE CERTIFICATION - LINCOLN LABS 360/67



        We have exercised Lincoln Labs Network software as follows: NCP,
ICP, ASCII Telnet (user and server), login procedure, access to CMS, and
operator and console communication.  All  behave  according  to  current
specifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Multiple message responses, such as  listing  users,  were  very
smooth under moderate to heavy load of the /67.
