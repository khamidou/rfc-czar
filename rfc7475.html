	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction and Scope</h2></a>

   This document updates RFC 2026 ([RFC2026], BCP 9) to remove a limit
   on the number of Area Directors who manage an Area in the definition
   of "IETF Area".  This document also updates RFC 2418 ([RFC2418], BCP
   25) to reflect this updated definition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The change described in this document is intended to allow the IESG
   additional flexibility in organizing the IETF's work.  It does not
   make any changes to the role of an Area and does not argue that
   assigning more than two Area Directors to an Area is an optimal
   solution in the long run.  In particular, this change is not intended
   to increase the size of the IESG significantly.  If several Areas
   will require more than two Area Directors, the IESG should consider
   investigating alternative ways of organizing the IETF's work.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Discussion</h2></a>

   In recent discussions, the IESG has explored splitting and combining
   Areas.  One proposal resulted in a single Area that would be managed
   by three Area Directors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An Area managed by three Area Directors conflicts with this
   definition in Section 14, "DEFINITIONS OF TERMS" of RFC 2026
   ([RFC2026]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A similar statement appears in Section 1, "Introduction" of RFC 2418
   ([RFC2418]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).
   While it's true that recent IESGs have had two Area Directors in each
   Area except for the General Area, the number of Area Directors in
   each Area has varied since the publication of RFC 1396 ([RFC1396]).
   (For reference, see <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/past-members.html>.)

   This variation was due to a number of factors, including workload and
   personal preferences, and happened as a natural part of the IESG
   organizing itself to do the work the IESG is chartered to do.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At one point, the IESG placed three Area Directors in a single Area
   (Scott Bradner, Deirdre Kostick, and Michael O'Dell, in the
   Operational & Management Requirements Area, between IETF 36 and IETF
   37 in 1996).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The last time the IESG increased the number of Area Directors in an
   Area was when they requested that the Nominating Committee provide a
   second Area Director in the Routing Area in 1999.  Although the
   number of Area Directors in an Area hasn't changed since then, the
   IESG continues to be responsible for specifying the positions that
   the Nominating Committee fills each year.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is consistent with the IESG's role in creating and dismantling
   entire Areas to allow the IESG flexibility in assigning enough Area
   Directors who have been selected by the Nominating Committee to
   effectively manage the working groups within an Area.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note the requirement in RFC 7437 ([RFC7437], BCP 10) that the
   Nominating Committee review (approximately) half the positions for
   the IESG each year is unchanged.  The Nominating Committee may assign
   an appropriate term duration for each position to ensure the ideal
   application of this rule in the future, and this is also unchanged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Normative Text Change</h2></a>

   For this text (OLD) in Section 14, "DEFINITIONS OF TERMS" of RFC 2026
   ([RFC2026]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Replace with this text (NEW):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or more Area Directors.
   For this text (OLD) in Section 1, "Introduction" of RFC 2418
   ([RFC2418]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Replace with this text (NEW):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Each IETF area is managed by one or more Area Directors (ADs).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Informational RFCs such as RFC 3710 ([RFC3710]) and informal
   descriptions of IETF organizational structure that also describe IETF
   Areas as being managed by one or two Area Directors should be
   considered updated by this normative specification.

   security implications.
