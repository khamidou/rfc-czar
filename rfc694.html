                          Protocol Information

Introduction

   This file contains information on the various protocols in the ARPA
   Network.  An effort will be made to keep the information current, but
   his depends on the cooperation of the users of this file to convey
   any information about protocol developments, or corrections to this
   information to Jon Postel at SRI-ARC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Online address is POSTEL@BBNB; Phone is (415) 326-6200 x 3718;<br>
      U.S. Mail address is Stanford Research Institute, Augmentation
      Research Center, 222 Ravenswood, Menlo park, California 94025.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is a compendium of all the protocol related activity and most of
   this activity and most of this activity is with experimental
   protocols, for those protocols, which are official standards the
   designation "[Official]" will be appended to the name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This protocol information file is online as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Pathname: [OFFICE-1] <NETINFO.PROTOCOL-INFORMATION.TXT

      and also [BBNB] <POSTEL.PROTCOL-INFORMATION.NLS

   Much of the documentation of protocols appears as Requests for
   Comments (RFCs) and many of these are available online.  When a
   document is accessible online a pointer to that source will be given.
   Also note that recent RFCs are online at Office-1 in directory
   <NETINFO> with names of the form RFCnnn.TXT where nnn is replaced by
   the RFC number.  There is also an index of recent RFCs as an online
   file:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      [Office-1] <NETINFOR>RFC-INDEX.TXT

   There are three other online files that are relevant to protocols:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There is a file that lists Official Host Names and associated
      information as described in RFC 608, the pathname of this file is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         [Office-1] <NETOINFO>HOSTS.TXT
      There are two files that list the addresses of the Network
      Liaisons, one file lists the online message address, and the other
      the US Mail address and phone number.  A network liaison is a
      person designated by a host organization as the contact and
      coordinator for network technical information fro that
      organization.

      These files are prepared by Jake Feinler of the Network
      Information Center (NIC).  Indeed the NIC has been very helpful in
      providing the online file space for the recent Request for
      Comments, and other protocol related files.  The NIC also
      maintains the hardcopy reference library of all RFCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NIC has assembled and filed with the National Technical
   information Service the collection of documents known as "ARPA
   Network Current Network Protocols".  This collection represents the
   more or less "official" protocols as of 1-December-74.  The accession
   number is ADA003890.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                  Section 3.1 contains additional information, which may

            BBN-TENEXA, but simulates a lot of JSYS calls which will be
            cast into the tenex operating system during the summer.  The

            The UCL (London) version for a PDP-9 is in the coding stage.
            We are continuing with the "three-way handshake" version
            which is highly reliable in environments which permit
            packets to be delivered on the order of hours later than
            they were injected into the connected networks.  A simple
            TCP is being designed for the packet radio network and does
            not use three-way handshake since waiting a second or so to
            clear out old packets in not serious.

   The national Software Works (NSW) is developing a set of protocols
   for its use of the ARPA Network, other uses of these protocols is
   encouraged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Distributed Programming System (DPS) is intended to facilitate
   the sharing of resources in the network at the subroutine level.  The
   Distributed Programming System will be used to split NLS into a front
   end and back end components.  Distributed Programming system is also
   to be used in the NSW and the basis for communication between the
   Works Manager, the Tool Bearing Hosts, and Front End procedure
   packages.
