                     IMP System Change Notification
                     ------------------------------


     During the week of 16 August, we installed a new version of
the IMP system, version 2505.  The new version incorporated three
principal changes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     1)  The number of hosts the system can handle was increased
         from three to four. Although this caused a rather large
         internal change to the IMP, the only external effects of
         the change are the presence of a new status light [light
         8 monitors Host 4], and the lengthening of the 10-second
         and snapshot statistics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     2)  The host handling routines were modified to gather more
         accurate and voluminous statistics on host usage of the
         network, and report them to NCC.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     3)  The 10-sec. statistics were changed to measure time for
         the host "round trip" statistic in units of 800 rather
         than 100 microseconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          It is not anticipated that the new system should have any
     direct effect on the hosts.
