	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development
   organisation in the field of distributed computing.  The OGF produces
   documents such as working drafts, specifications, and schemata.  For
   more information, see <http://www.ogf.org/>.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Working groups in the OGF community have expressed the need for
   global, distributed, persistent identifiers in working drafts and
   standards.  Motivated by this need, the OGF would like to assign URNs
   to some resources in order to retain unique, permanent, location-
   independent names for them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Language</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   URN Specification for "ogf" Namespace ID (NID)</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Namespace ID</h3></a>

   "ogf" (where "ogf" is an acronym for "Open Grid Forum").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Registration Information</h3></a>

   Registration Version Number: 1
   Registration Date: December 2011

	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Declared Registrant of the Namespace</h3></a>

   Technical Director
   Open Grid Forum
   P.O. Box 1738
   Muncie, Indiana  47308
   USA
   http://www.ogf.org/
   EMail: urn@ogf.org

   The position of Technical Director is currently fulfilled by Joel
   Replogle.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Declaration of Syntactic Structure</h3></a>

   The formal syntax definitions below are given in ABNF [RFC5234].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The namespace-specific string (NSS) in the urn:ogf names hierarchy
   begins with a subnamespace identifier (SNID), followed by a delimiter
   and a subnamespace-dependent string

      OGF-URN  =  "urn:ogf:" SNID ":" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING

   where <SNID> is a unique subnamespace identifier for the
   specification, and <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> is a unique
   identifier within the subnamespace identifier scope.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <SNID> has the same syntax as a <NID> as defined in [RFC2141]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SNID  =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )  *31( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )

   ALPHA and DIGIT are defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) assigns SNIDs.
   The syntax of <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> is dependent on the
   <SNID> and MUST be defined by a Grid Forum Document [GFD.1].  This
   document does not pose any additional restrictions to the
   <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> other than what is defined in the NSS
   syntax as defined by [RFC2141] or its successor:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>

   <URN chars> is defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.5"><h3>2.5   Relevant Ancillary Documentation</h3></a>

   The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) will keep a list
   of assigned subnamespace identifiers and associated documentation at
   <http://www.ogf.org/urn/> [URN-OGF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The procedures regarding how to register a subnamespace identifier
   are described in [GFD.191] and can also be found at the above
   Website.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.6"><h3>2.6   Identifier Uniqueness Considerations</h3></a>

   Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Technical Director of
   the Open Grid Forum.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OGF Technical Director may sub-delegate part of the namespace to
   third parties.  It will not be permissible, neither by the OGF nor
   any third party, to re-assign previously assigned URNs.  A practical
   consequence is that a previously assigned subnamespace cannot be
   re-assigned, unless additional arrangements are made to prevent
   identifier re-assignments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.7"><h3>2.7   Identifier Persistence Considerations</h3></a>

   The Technical Director will only assign subnamespace identifiers for
   persistent resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to enforce identifier persistence for individual resources,
   each document defining subnamespace identifiers MUST contain a
   section on the type of resource that is specified (e.g., whether a
   URN in the subnamespace identifies a specific version of a resource,
   the latest version of a resource, a specific manifestation, or a more
   general concept).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The namespace identifier "ogf" MUST NOT change, even if the Open Grid
   Forum changes its name or is disbanded.
	<a name="section-2.8"><h3>2.8   Process of Identifier Assignment</h3></a>

   Assignment of subnamespace identifiers is limited to the OGF and
   those authorities that are specifically designated by the OGF
   Technical Director of the OGF.  The OGF may assign portions of its
   namespace (specifically, those under designated subnamespace
   identifiers) for assignment by third parties.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The details of this process are specified in [GFD.191].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax and semantics of each subnamespace MUST be defined by a
   Grid Forum Document [GFD.1] before the corresponding SNID is
   assigned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.9"><h3>2.9   Process of Identifier Resolution</h3></a>

   The OGF namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery
   System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future
   definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with an RDS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OGF will maintain an index of all subnamespace identifiers on its
   Website <http://www.ogf.org/urn/>.  This list may refer to known
   Resolution Discovery Systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.10"><h3>2.10   Rules for Lexical Equivalence</h3></a>

   The <SNID> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is case insensitive.
   Thus, the <SNID> MUST be case normalised before comparison.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The rules for lexical equivalence of the
   <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is
   specific for each SNID and MUST be defined when a SNID is assigned by
   the OGF Technical Director.  These definitions MUST include
   information about case sensitivity, and in the case of %-escaped
   octets, MUST define the exact normalisation to be used (e.g.,
   interpret as octet, interpret as UTF-8, specify type of Unicode
   normalisation factor, etc.).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.11"><h3>2.11   Conformance with URN Syntax</h3></a>

   The intention of this document is to only restrict the syntax of the
   <SNID>.  The syntax of the <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> follows the
   general syntax of a URN:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>
   Documents defining a subnamespace identifier SHOULD specify further
   syntactic restrictions in <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that these documents forbid the assignment of URNs
   containing characters in the <reserved> set ("%", "/", "?", and "#")
   as defined in [RFC2141].  This is in accordance with Section 2.2 of
   [RFC3986].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For forward compatibility, it is RECOMMENDED that software
   implementations that don't validate subnamespace-specific strings
   validate the syntax according to the generic rules for validating
   URIs, as defined in [RFC3986].  URIs may contain all characters
   defined in <URN chars>, including the characters in <reserved>
   (albeit they have a special meaning), as well as the characters "&"
   and "~".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.12"><h3>2.12   Validation Mechanism</h3></a>

   The validation mechanism of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for
   each SNID and SHOULD be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF
   Technical Director.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   URNs in the OGF hierarchy without an assigned SNID are considered to
   be invalid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.13"><h3>2.13   Scope</h3></a>

   Global URNs are relevant for the distributed computing community in
   general, and the Open Grid Forum in particular.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Examples (Informative)</h2></a>

   Since no subnamespace identifiers have been defined yet, no actual
   examples can be given.  Therefore, the following examples are not
   guaranteed to be real or even syntactically correct.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Grid Forum Documents defining the "gfd" and "network" subnamespace
   identifiers may give the following examples.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  urn:ogf:gfd:136

   o  urn:ogf:network:canarie.ca:kisti-uninett-glif-001

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Namespace Considerations</h2></a>

   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development
   organisation in the field of distributed computing.
   The use of the OGF hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but
   not limited to usage for:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Grid Forum Documents

   o  XML (Extensible Markup Language) Schemata

   o  RDF (Resource Description Framework) Schemata

   The Open Grid Forum is dedicated to openly publishing all technical
   documentation related to URNs in the OGF hierarchy and allowing
   unlimited distribution of these documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Community Considerations</h2></a>

   Members of the distributed computing community will benefit from
   persistent and globally unique identifiers for use in protocols
   developed by the Open Grid Forum.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Practical use of the urn:ogf namespace has been detected, and a
   formal registration will allow the Open Grid Forum to document this
   usage and enforce technical review of current practices.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that implementers check the OGF registry and
   documentation [URN-OGF] before assuming that a given identifier is
   valid or has a certain meaning.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has registered the "ogf" namespace identifier (NID) with a
   reference to this document in the "Formal URN Namespaces"
   sub-registry [RFC3406] of the "Uniform Resource Names (URN)
   Namespaces" registry [URN-NAMESPACES].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Acknowledgements</h2></a>

   The template and useful examples from [RFC3406] formed the basis for
   this document.  The authors would like to thank Joel Replogle and
   Andre Mersky for setting up the urn:ogf subnamespace registry.
