</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been
   extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request
   information about DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to
   queries for individual bindings.  In some situations individual
   binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.  This
   document expands on the Leasequery protocol, adding new query types
   and allowing for bulk transfer of DHCPv6 binding data via TCP.

   The DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol specifies a mechanism for the
   assignment of IPv6 address and configuration information to IPv6
   nodes.  IPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) for DHCPv6 [RFC3633] specifies a
   mechanism for DHCPv6 delegation of IPv6 prefixes and related data.
   DHCPv6 servers maintain authoritative information including binding
   information for delegated IPv6 prefixes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client of a PD binding is typically a router, which then
   advertises the delegated prefix to locally-connected hosts.  The
   delegated IPv6 prefix must be routeable in order to be useful.  The
   actual DHCPv6 PD client may not be permitted to inject routes into
   the delegating network.  In service-provider (SP) networks, for
   example, an edge router typically acts as a DHCPv6 relay agent, and
   this edge router often has the responsibility to maintain routes
   within the service-provider network for clients' PD bindings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A DHCPv6 relay with this responsibility requires a means to recover
   binding information from the authoritative DHCPv6 server(s) in the
   event of replacement or reboot, in order to restore routeability to
   delegated prefixes.  The relay may be a network device without
   adequate local storage to maintain the necessary binding-to-route
   data.  A DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol [RFC5007] has been developed that
   allows queries for individual bindings from the authoritative DHCPv6
   server(s).  The individual query mechanism is only useable when the
   target binding is known to the requestor, such as upon receipt of
   traffic.  In the case of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, the PD binding
   data may need to be known before any traffic arrives from the client
   router.  The DHCPv6 relay router may not be able to form individual
   queries in such cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document extends the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol to add support
   for queries that address these requirements.  At the SP edge there
   may be many thousands of delegated prefixes per relay, so we specify
   the use of TCP [RFC4614] for efficiency of data transfer.  We specify
   a new DHCPv6 option, the Relay Identifier option, to support
   efficient recovery of all data associated with a specific relay
   agent; we also add a query-type for this purpose.  We add query-types
   by network segment and by Remote-ID option value, to assist a relay
   that needs to recover a subset of its clients' bindings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   DHCPv6 terminology is defined in [RFC3315].  DHCPv6 Leasequery
   terminology is defined in [RFC5007].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Protocol Overview</h2></a>

   The Bulk Leasequery mechanism is modeled on the existing individual
   Leasequery protocol in [RFC5007]; most differences arise from the use
   of TCP.  A Bulk Leasequery client opens a TCP connection to a DHCPv6
   server, using the DHCPv6 port 547.  Note that this implies that the
   Leasequery client has server IP address(es) available via
   configuration or some other means, and that it has unicast IP
   reachability to the server.  No relaying for bulk leasequery is
   specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After establishing a connection, the client sends a LEASEQUERY
   message containing a query-type and data about bindings it is
   interested in.  The server uses the query-type and the data to
   identify any relevant bindings.  In order to support some query-
   types, servers may have to maintain additional data structures or be
   able to locate bindings based on specific option data.  The server
   replies with a LEASEQUERY-REPLY message, indicating the success or
   failure of the query.  If the query was successful, the server
   includes the first client's binding data in the LEASEQUERY-REPLY
   message also.  If more than one client's bindings are being returned,
   the server then transmits the additional client bindings in a series
   of LEASEQUERY-DATA messages.  If the server has sent at least one
   client's bindings, it sends a LEASEQUERY-DONE message when it has
   finished sending its replies.  The client may reuse the connection to
   send additional queries.  Each end of the TCP connection can be
   closed after all data has been sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification includes a new DHCPv6 option, the Relay-ID option.
   The option contains a DUID (DHCP Unique Identifier) identifying a
   DHCPv6 relay agent.  Relay agents can include this option in Relay-
   Forward messages they send.  Servers can retain the Relay-ID and
   associate it with bindings made on behalf of the relay's clients.  A
   relay can then recover binding information about downstream clients
   by using the Relay-ID in a LEASEQUERY message.  The Relay-ID option
   is defined in Section 5.4.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bulk Leasequery supports the queries by IPv6 address and by Client
   DUID as specified in [RFC5007].  The Bulk Leasequery protocol also
   adds several new queries.  The new queries introduced here cannot be
   used effectively with the UDP Leasequery protocol.  Requestors MUST
   NOT send these new query-types in [RFC5007] query messages.
   Query by Relay Identifier -  This query asks a server for the
      bindings associated with a specific relay; the relay is identified
      by a DUID carried in a Relay-ID option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Query by Link Address -  This query asks a server for the bindings on
      a particular network segment; the link is specified in the query's
      link-address field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Query by Remote ID -  This query asks a server for the bindings
      associated with a Relay Agent Remote-ID option [RFC4649] value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Interaction between UDP Leasequery and Bulk Leasequery</h2></a>

   Bulk Leasequery can be seen as an extension of the existing UDP
   Leasequery protocol [RFC5007].  This section tries to clarify the
   relationship between the two protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The query-types introduced in the UDP Leasequery protocol can be used
   in the Bulk Leasequery protocol.  One change in behavior is
   introduced when Bulk Leasequery is used.  [RFC5007], in sections
   4.1.2.5 and 4.3.3, specifies the use of a Client Link option in
   LEASEQUERY-REPLY messages in cases where multiple bindings were
   found.  When Bulk Leasequery is used, this mechanism is not
   necessary: a server returning multiple bindings simply does so
   directly as specified in this document.  The Client Link option MUST
   NOT appear in Bulk Leasequery replies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Only LEASEQUERY, LEASEQUERY-REPLY, LEASEQUERY-DATA, and LEASEQUERY-
   DONE messages are allowed over the Bulk Leasequery connection.  No
   other DHCPv6 messages are supported.  The Bulk Leasequery connection
   is not an alternative DHCPv6 communication option for clients seeking
   DHCPv6 service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The new queries introduced in this specification cannot be used with
   the UDP Leasequery protocol.  Servers that implement this
   specification and also permit UDP queries MUST NOT accept Bulk
   Leasequery query-types in UDP Leasequery messages.  Such servers MUST
   respond with an error status code of NotAllowed [RFC5007].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementors should note that the TCP message framing defined in
   Section 5.1 is not compatible with the UDP message format.  If a TCP-
   framed request is sent as a UDP message, it may not be valid, because
   protocol fields will be offset by the message-size prefix.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Message and Option Definitions</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Message Framing for TCP</h3></a>

   The use of TCP for the Bulk Leasequery protocol permits one or more
   DHCPv6 messages to be sent at a time.  The receiver needs to be able
   to determine how large each message is.  Two octets containing the
   message size in network byte order are prepended to each DHCPv6
   message sent on a Bulk Leasequery TCP connection.  The two message-
   size octets 'frame' each DHCPv6 message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DHCPv6 message framed for TCP:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All other fields are as specified in DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Messages</h3></a>

   The LEASEQUERY and LEASEQUERY-REPLY messages are defined in
   [RFC5007].  In a Bulk Leasequery exchange, a single LEASEQUERY-REPLY
   message is used to indicate the success or failure of a query, and to
   carry data that do not change in the context of a single query and
   answer, such as the Server-ID and Client-ID options.  If a query is
   successful, only a single LEASEQUERY-REPLY message MUST appear.  If
   the server is returning binding data, the LEASEQUERY-REPLY also
   contains the first client's binding data in an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA
   option.
	<a name="section-5.2.1"><h4>5.2.1   LEASEQUERY-DATA</h4></a>

   The LEASEQUERY-DATA message carries data about a single DHCPv6
   client's leases and/or PD bindings on a single link.  The purpose of
   the message is to reduce redundant data when there are multiple
   bindings to be sent.  The LEASEQUERY-DATA message MUST be preceded by
   a LEASEQUERY-REPLY message.  The LEASEQUERY-REPLY carries the query's
   status, the Leasequery's Client-ID and Server-ID options, and the
   first client's binding data if the query was successful.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   LEASEQUERY-DATA MUST ONLY be sent in response to a successful
   LEASEQUERY, and only if more than one client's data is to be sent.
   The LEASEQUERY-DATA message's transaction-id field MUST match the
   transaction-id of the LEASEQUERY request message.  The Server-ID,
   Client-ID, and OPTION_STATUS_CODE options SHOULD NOT be included:
   that data should be constant for any one Bulk Leasequery reply, and
   should have been conveyed in the LEASEQUERY-REPLY message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2.2"><h4>5.2.2   LEASEQUERY-DONE</h4></a>

   The LEASEQUERY-DONE message indicates the end of a group of related
   Leasequery replies.  The LEASEQUERY-DONE message's transaction-id
   field MUST match the transaction-id of the LEASEQUERY request
   message.  The presence of the message itself signals the end of a
   stream of reply messages.  A single LEASEQUERY-DONE MUST BE sent
   after all replies (a successful LEASEQUERY-REPLY and zero or more
   LEASEQUERY-DATA messages) to a successful Bulk Leasequery request
   that returned at least one binding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server may encounter an error condition after it has sent the
   initial LEASEQUERY-REPLY.  In that case, it SHOULD attempt to send a
   LEASEQUERY-DONE with an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option indicating the
   error condition to the requestor.  Other DHCPv6 options SHOULD NOT be
   included in the LEASEQUERY-DONE message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Query Types</h3></a>

   The OPTION_LQ_QUERY option is defined in [RFC5007].  We introduce the
   following new query-types: QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID, QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS,
   and QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID.  These queries are designed to assist relay
   agents in recovering binding data in circumstances where some or all
   of the relay's binding data has been lost.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.1"><h4>5.3.1   QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID</h4></a>

   This query asks the server to return bindings associated with the
   specified relay DUID.
   QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID -   The query-options MUST contain an
      OPTION_RELAY_ID option.  If the link-address field is 0::0, the
      query asks for all bindings associated with the specified relay
      DUID.  If the link-address is specified, the query asks for
      bindings on that link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.2"><h4>5.3.2   QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS</h4></a>

   The QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS asks the server to return bindings on a
   network segment identified by a link-address value from a relay's
   Relay-Forward message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS -   The query's link-address contains an
      address a relay may have used in the link-address of a Relay-
      Forward message.  The Server attempts to locate bindings on the
      same network segment as the link-address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3.3"><h4>5.3.3   QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID</h4></a>

   The QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID asks the server to return bindings associated
   with a Remote-ID option value from a relay's Relay-Forward message.
   The query-options MUST include a Relay Agent Remote-ID option
   [RFC4649].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to support this query, a server needs to record the most-
   recent Remote-ID option value seen in a Relay-Forward message along
   with its other binding data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID -   The query-options MUST include a Relay Agent
      Remote-ID option [RFC4649].  If the Server has recorded Remote-ID
      values with its bindings, it uses the option's value to identify
      bindings to return.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   Options</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5.4.1"><h4>5.4.1   Relay-ID Option</h4></a>

   The Relay-ID option carries a DUID [RFC3315].  A relay agent MAY
   include the option in Relay-Forward messages it sends.  Obviously, it
   will not be possible for a server to respond to QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID
   queries unless the relay agent has included this option.  A relay
   SHOULD be able to generate a DUID for this purpose, and capture the
   result in stable storage.  A relay SHOULD also allow the DUID value
   to be configurable: doing so allows an administrator to replace a
   relay agent while retaining the association between the relay and
   existing DHCPv6 bindings.
   A DHCPv6 server MAY associate Relay-ID options from Relay-Forward
   messages it processes with prefix delegations and/or lease bindings
   that result.  Doing so allows it to respond to QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID
   Leasequeries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The format of the Relay-ID option is shown below:

   QueryTerminated - Indicates that the server is unable to perform a
   query or has prematurely terminated the query for some reason (which
   should be communicated in the text of the message).  This may be
   because the server is short of resources or is being shut down.  The
   requestor may retry the query at a later time.  The requestor should
   wait at least a short interval before retrying.  Note that while a
   server may simply prematurely close its end of the connection, it is
   preferable for the server to send a LEASEQUERY-REPLY or LEASEQUERY-
   DONE with this status-code to notify the requestor of the condition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6   Connection and Transmission Parameters</h3></a>

   DHCPv6 servers that support Bulk Leasequery SHOULD listen for
   incoming TCP connections on the DHCPv6 server port 547.
   Implementations MAY offer to make the incoming port configurable, but
   port 547 MUST be the default.  Client implementations SHOULD make TCP
   connections to port 547, and MAY offer to make the destination server
   port configurable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This section presents a table of values used to control Bulk
   Leasequery behavior, including recommended defaults.  Implementations
   MAY make these values configurable.  However, configuring too-small
   timeout values may lead to harmful behavior both to this application
   as well as to other traffic in the network.  As a result, timeout
   values smaller than the default values are NOT RECOMMENDED.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Parameter             Default   Description
   -------------------------------------------
   BULK_LQ_DATA_TIMEOUT  300 s     Bulk Leasequery data timeout
   BULK_LQ_MAX_CONNS     10        Max Bulk Leasequery TCP connections

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Requestor Behavior</h2></a>

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Connecting</h3></a>

   A requestor attempts to establish a TCP connection to a DHCPv6 server
   in order to initiate a Leasequery exchange.  If the attempt fails,
   the requestor MAY retry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Forming Queries</h3></a>

   After a connection is established, the requestor constructs a
   Leasequery message, as specified in [RFC5007].  The query may have
   any of the defined query-types, and includes the options and data
   required by the query-type chosen.  The requestor sends the message
   size then sends the actual DHCPv6 message, as described in
   Section 5.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the TCP connection becomes blocked or stops being writeable while
   the requestor is sending its query, the requestor SHOULD be prepared
   to terminate the connection after BULK_LQ_DATA_TIMEOUT.  We make this
   recommendation to allow requestors to control the period of time they
   are willing to wait before abandoning a connection, independent of
   notifications from the TCP implementations they may be using.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Processing Replies</h3></a>

   The requestor attempts to read a LEASEQUERY-REPLY message from the
   TCP connection.  If the TCP connection stops delivering reply data
   (if the connection stops being readable), the requestor SHOULD be
   prepared to terminate the connection after BULK_LQ_DATA_TIMEOUT, and
   MAY begin retry-processing if configured to do so.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The requestor examines the LEASEQUERY-REPLY message, and determines
   how to proceed.  Message validation rules are specified in DHCPv6
   Leasequery [RFC5007].  If the reply contains an error status code
   (carried in an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option), the requestor follows the
   recommendations in [RFC5007].  A successful reply that does not
   include an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option indicates that the target server
   had no bindings matching the query.
   Note: The Leasequery protocol uses the OPTION_CLIENT_LINK option as
   an indicator that multiple bindings were present in response to a
   single query.  For Bulk Leasequery, the OPTION_CLIENT_LINK option is
   not used, and MUST NOT be present in replies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A successful LEASEQUERY-REPLY that is returning binding data includes
   an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option and possibly additional options.  If
   there are additional bindings to be returned, they will be carried in
   LEASEQUERY-DATA messages.  Each LEASEQUERY-DATA message contains an
   OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option, and possibly other options.  A LEASEQUERY-
   DATA message that does not contain an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA MUST be
   discarded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A single bulk query can result in a large number of replies.  For
   example, a single relay agent might be responsible for routes for
   thousands of clients' delegated prefixes.  The requestor MUST be
   prepared to receive more than one LEASEQUERY-DATA with transaction-
   ids matching a single LEASEQUERY message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LEASEQUERY-DONE message ends a successful Bulk Leasequery request
   that returned at least one binding.  A LEASEQUERY-REPLY without any
   bindings MUST NOT be followed by a LEASEQUERY-DONE message for the
   same transaction-id.  After receiving LEASEQUERY-DONE from a server,
   the requestor MAY close the TCP connection to that server.  If the
   transaction-id in the LEASEQUERY-DONE does not match an outstanding
   LEASEQUERY message, the client MUST close the TCP connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3.1"><h4>6.3.1   Reply Completion</h4></a>

   The reply to a Bulk Leasequery request is complete (i.e., no further
   messages for that request transaction-id will be received) when one
   of these conditions is met:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  if the LEASEQUERY-REPLY message had no OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option,
       when the LEASEQUERY-REPLY is received,

   2.  else if the LEASEQUERY-REPLY did have an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, when
       the corresponding LEASEQUERY-DONE message is received,

   3.  else when the connection is closed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.4"><h3>6.4   Querying Multiple Servers</h3></a>

   A Bulk Leasequery client MAY be configured to attempt to connect to
   and query from multiple DHCPv6 servers in parallel.  The DHCPv6
   Leasequery specification [RFC5007] includes a discussion about
   reconciling binding data received from multiple DHCPv6 servers.
	<a name="section-6.5"><h3>6.5   Multiple Queries to a Single Server</h3></a>

   Bulk Leasequery clients may need to make multiple queries in order to
   recover binding information.  A requestor MAY use a single connection
   to issue multiple queries.  Each query MUST have a unique
   transaction-id.  A server MAY process more than one query at a time.
   A server that is willing to do so MAY interleave replies to the
   multiple queries within the stream of reply messages it sends.
   Clients need to be aware that replies for multiple queries may be
   interleaved within the stream of reply messages.  Clients that are
   not able to process interleaved replies (based on transaction-id)
   MUST NOT send more than one query at a time.  Requestors should be
   aware that servers are not required to process queries in parallel,
   and that servers are likely to limit the rate at which they process
   queries from any one requestor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5.1"><h4>6.5.1   Example</h4></a>

   This example illustrates what a series of queries and responses might
   look like.  This is only an example -- there is no requirement that
   this sequence must be followed, or that clients or servers must
   support parallel queries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the example session, the client sends four queries after
   establishing a connection; "xid" denotes a transaction-id in the
   diagram.  Query 1 results in a failure; query 2 succeeds and the
   stream of replies concludes before the client issues any new query.
   Query 3 and query 4 overlap, and the server interleaves its replies
   to those two queries.
        Client                        Server
        ------                        ------

                         <-----       LEASEQUERY-DONE xid 4

	<a name="section-6.6"><h3>6.6   Closing Connections</h3></a>

   The requestor MAY close its end of the TCP connection after sending a
   LEASEQUERY message to the server.  The requestor MAY choose to retain
   the connection if it intends to issue additional queries.  Note that
   this client behavior does not guarantee that the connection will be
   available for additional queries: the server might decide to close
   the connection based on its own configuration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Server Behavior</h2></a>

	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   Accepting Connections</h3></a>

   Servers that implement DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery listen for incoming TCP
   connections.  Port numbers are discussed in Section 5.6.  Servers
   MUST be able to limit the number of currently accepted and active
   connections.  The value BULK_LQ_MAX_CONNS MUST be the default;
   implementations MAY permit the value to be configurable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers MAY restrict Bulk Leasequery connections and LEASEQUERY
   messages to certain clients.  Connections that are not from permitted
   clients SHOULD BE closed immediately, to avoid server connection
   resource exhaustion.  Servers MAY restrict some clients to certain
   query types.  Servers MAY reply to queries that are not permitted
   with the NotAllowed status code [RFC5007], and/or close the
   connection.
   If the TCP connection becomes blocked while the server is accepting a
   connection or reading a query, it SHOULD be prepared to terminate the
   connection after BULK_LQ_DATA_TIMEOUT.  We make this recommendation
   to allow Servers to control the period of time they are willing to
   wait before abandoning an inactive connection, independent of the TCP
   implementations they may be using.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   Forming Replies</h3></a>

   The DHCPv6 Leasequery [RFC5007] specification describes the initial
   construction of LEASEQUERY-REPLY messages and the processing of
   QUERY_BY_ADDRESS and QUERY_BY_CLIENTID.  Use of the LEASEQUERY-REPLY
   and LEASEQUERY-DATA messages to carry multiple bindings is described
   in Section 5.2.  Message transmission and framing for TCP is
   described in Section 5.1.  If the connection becomes blocked while
   the server is attempting to send reply messages, the server SHOULD be
   prepared to terminate the TCP connection after BULK_LQ_DATA_TIMEOUT.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the server encounters an error during initial query processing,
   before any reply has been sent, it SHOULD send a LEASEQUERY-REPLY
   containing an error code in an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option.  This
   signals to the requestor that no data will be returned.  If the
   server encounters an error while processing a query that has already
   resulted in one or more reply messages, the server SHOULD send a
   LEASEQUERY-DONE message with an error status.  The server SHOULD
   close its end of the connection as an indication that it was not able
   to complete query processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the server does not find any bindings satisfying a query, it
   SHOULD send a LEASEQUERY-REPLY without an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option
   and without any OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option.  Otherwise, the server
   sends each binding's data in a reply message.  The first reply
   message is a LEASEQUERY-REPLY.  The binding data is carried in an
   OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option, as specified in [RFC5007] and extended
   below.  The server returns subsequent bindings in LEASEQUERY-DATA
   messages, which can avoid redundant data (such as the requestor's
   Client-ID).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID, the server locates each binding associated
   with the query's Relay-ID option value.  In order to give a
   meaningful reply to a QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID, the server has to be able to
   maintain this association in its DHCPv6 binding data.  If the query's
   link-address is not set to 0::0, the server only returns bindings on
   links that could contain that address.  If the link-address is not
   0::0 and the server cannot find any matching links, the server SHOULD
   return the NotConfigured status in a LEASEQUERY-REPLY.
   For QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS, the server locates each binding associated
   with the link identified by the query's link-address value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID, the server locates each binding associated
   with the query's Relay Remote-ID option value.  In order to be able
   to give meaningful replies to this query, the server has to be able
   to maintain this association in its binding database.  If the query
   message's link-address is not set to 0::0, the server only returns
   bindings on links that could contain that address.  If the link-
   address is not 0::0 and the server cannot find any matching links,
   the server SHOULD return the NotConfigured status in a LEASEQUERY-
   REPLY.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The server sends the LEASEQUERY-DONE message as specified in
   Section 5.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3   Multiple or Parallel Queries</h3></a>

   As discussed in Section 6.5, requestors may want to leverage an
   existing connection if they need to make multiple queries.  Servers
   MAY support reading and processing multiple queries from a single
   connection.  A server MUST NOT read more query messages from a
   connection than it is prepared to process simultaneously.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This MAY be a feature that is administratively controlled.  Servers
   that are able to process queries in parallel SHOULD offer
   configuration that limits the number of simultaneous queries
   permitted from any one requestor, in order to control resource use if
   there are multiple requestors seeking service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.4"><h3>7.4   Closing Connections</h3></a>

   The server MAY close its end of the TCP connection after sending its
   last message (a LEASEQUERY-REPLY or a LEASEQUERY-DONE) in response to
   a query.  Alternatively, the server MAY retain the connection and
   wait for additional queries from the client.  The server SHOULD be
   prepared to limit the number of connections it maintains, and SHOULD
   be prepared to close idle connections to enforce the limit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The server MUST close its end of the TCP connection if it encounters
   an error sending data on the connection.  The server MUST close its
   end of the TCP connection if it finds that it has to abort an in-
   process request.  A server aborting an in-process request MAY attempt
   to notify its clients by using the QueryTerminated (Section 5.5)
   status code.  If the server detects that the client end has been
   closed, the server MUST close its end of the connection after it has
   finished processing any outstanding requests from the client.
	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The "Security Considerations" section of [RFC3315] details the
   general threats to DHCPv6.  The DHCPv6 Leasequery specification
   [RFC5007] describes recommendations for the Leasequery protocol,
   especially with regard to relayed LEASEQUERY messages, mitigation of
   packet-flooding denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, restriction to
   trusted clients, and use of IPsec [RFC4301].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of TCP introduces some additional concerns.  Attacks that
   attempt to exhaust the DHCPv6 server's available TCP connection
   resources, such as SYN flooding attacks, can compromise the ability
   of legitimate clients to receive service.  Malicious clients who
   succeed in establishing connections, but who then send invalid
   queries, partial queries, or no queries at all also can exhaust a
   server's pool of available connections.  We recommend that servers
   offer configuration to limit the sources of incoming connections,
   that they limit the number of accepted connections and the number of
   in-process queries from any one connection, and that they limit the
   period of time during which an idle connection will be left open.
