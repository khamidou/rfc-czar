                Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node may
   have several care-of addresses but only one, called the primary
   care-of address, can be registered with its home agent and the
   correspondent nodes.  However, for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay,
   etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get Internet access through
   multiple accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would
   be configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses.  This
   document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register
   and use multiple care-of addresses.  The extensions proposed in this
   document can be used by mobile routers using the NEMO (Network
   Mobility) Basic Support protocol as well.</h1>

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   A mobile node may use various types of network interfaces to obtain
   durable and wide area network connectivity.  This has increasingly
   become true with mobile nodes having multiple interfaces, such as
   802.2, 802.11, 802.16, cellular radios, etc.  The motivations for and
   benefits of using multiple points of attachment are discussed in
   [MOTIVATION].  When a mobile node with multiple interfaces uses
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] for mobility management, it cannot use its
   multiple interfaces to send and receive packets while taking
   advantage of session continuity provided by Mobile IPv6.  This is
   because Mobile IPv6 allows the mobile node to bind only one care-of
   address at a time with its home address.  See [MIP6ANALYSIS] for a
   further analysis of using multiple interfaces and addresses with
   Mobile IPv6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 to allow a mobile
   node to register multiple care-of addresses for a home address and
   create multiple binding cache entries.  A new Binding Identification
   (BID) number is created for each binding the mobile node wants to
   create and is sent in the Binding Update.  The home agent that
   receives this Binding Update creates a separate binding for each BID.
   The BID information is stored in the corresponding binding cache
   entry.  The BID information can now be used to identify individual
   bindings.  The same extensions can also be used in Binding Updates
   sent to the correspondent nodes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   Terms used in this document are defined in [RFC3775], [RFC3753], and
   [RFC4885].  In addition to or as a replacement of these, the
   following terms are defined or redefined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Binding Identification Number (BID)

      The BID is an identification number used to distinguish multiple
      bindings registered by the mobile node.  Assignment of distinct
      BIDs allows a mobile node to register multiple binding cache
      entries for a given home address.  BIDs assigned to the same home
      address must not be duplicated at the same time.  The value zero
      is reserved for future extensions.  Each BID is generated and
      managed by a mobile node.  The BID is stored in the Binding Update
      List and is sent by the mobile node in the Binding Update.  A
      mobile node may change the value of a BID at any time according to
      its administrative policy -- for instance, to protect its privacy.
      An implementation must carefully assign the BID so as to keep
      using the same BID for the same binding even when the status of
      the binding is changed.  More details can be found in Section 5.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Binding Identifier Mobility Option

      The Binding Identifier mobility option is used to carry the BID
      information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Bulk Registration

      A mobile node can register multiple bindings at once by sending a
      single Binding Update.  A mobile node can also replace some or all
      of the bindings available at the home agent with the new bindings
      by using the bulk registration.  Bulk registration is supported
      only for home registration (i.e., with the home agent) as
      explained in Section 5.3.  A mobile node must not perform the bulk
      registration mechanism described in this specification with a
      correspondent node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Protocol Overview</h2></a>

   A new extension called the Binding Identification number (BID) is
   introduced to distinguish between multiple bindings pertaining to the
   same home address.  If a mobile node configures several IPv6 global
   addresses on one or more of its interfaces, it can register these
   addresses with its home agent as care-of addresses.  If the mobile
   node wants to register multiple bindings, it MUST generate a BID for
   each care-of address and store the BID in the Binding Update List.  A
   mobile node can manipulate each binding independently by using the
   BIDs.  The mobile node then registers its care-of addresses by
   sending a Binding Update with a Binding Identifier mobility option.
   The BID is included in the Binding Identifier mobility option.  After
   receiving the Binding Update with a Binding Identifier mobility
   option, the home agent MUST copy the BID from the Binding Identifier
   mobility option to the corresponding field in the binding cache
   entry.  If there is an existing binding cache entry for the mobile
   node, and if the BID in the Binding Update does not match the one
   with the existing entry, the home agent MUST create a new binding
   cache entry for the new care-of address and BID.  The mobile node can
   either register multiple care-of addresses at once in a single
   Binding Update or independently in individual Binding Updates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the mobile host wishes to register its binding with a
   correspondent node, it must perform return routability operations as
   described in [RFC3775].  This includes managing a Care-of Keygen
   token per care-of address and exchanging Care-of Test Init and Care-
   of Test messages with the correspondent node for each care-of
   address.  The mobile node MAY use the same BID that it used with the
   home agent for a particular care-of address.  For protocol
   simplicity, bulk registration to correspondent nodes is not supported
   in this document.  This is because the return routability mechanism
   introduced in [RFC3775] cannot be easily extended to verify multiple
   care-of addresses stored in a single Binding Update.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 1 illustrates the configuration where the mobile node obtains
   multiple care-of addresses at foreign links.  The mobile node can
   utilize all the care-of addresses.  In Figure 1, the home address of
   the mobile node (MN) is 2001:db8::EUI.  The mobile node has 3
   different interfaces and possibly acquires care-of addresses 1-3
   (CoA1, CoA2, CoA3).  The mobile node assigns BID1, BID2, and BID3 to
   each care-of address.<pre>

                 binding [2001:db8::EUI  BID1 care-of address1]
                 binding [2001:db8::EUI  BID2 care-of address2]

                 binding [2001:db8::EUI  BID3 care-of address3]

           Figure 1: Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration

   If the mobile node decides to act as a regular mobile node compliant
   with [RFC3775], it sends a Binding Update without any Binding
   Identifier mobility options.  The receiver of the Binding Update
   deletes all the bindings registered with a BID and registers only a
   single binding for the mobile node.  Note that the mobile node can
   continue using the BID even if it has only a single binding that is
   active.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Binding cache lookup is done based on the home address and BID
   information if a BID is available.  This is different from RFC 3775,
   where only the home address is used for binding cache lookup.
   Binding cache lookup is operated for either protocol signaling or
   data packets.  For protocol signaling such as a Binding Update, BID
   should be always carried by a BID sub-option in a protocol signaling.
   Therefore, a correspondent binding cache that matches the specified
   BID MUST be found from the binding cache database.  On the other
   hand, for the data packets, no BID information is carried in a
   packet.  The binding cache lookup may involve policy or flow filters
   to retrieve a correspondent BID per packet in cases where some policy
   or flow filters are used to direct a certain packet or flow to a
   particular care-of address.  However, the binding cache lookup using
   policy or flow filters is out of scope for this document.  If no such
   mechanism is available and no BID is found for a packet, a node
   SHOULD use the binding that was last verified by receiving data
   packets or signaling from the mobile node.  In case the binding cache
   lookup for data packets, using the combination of home address and
   BID, does not return a valid binding cache entry, the home agent
   SHOULD perform the lookup based on only the home address as described
   in [RFC3775].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In any case, to avoid problems with upper-layer protocols and TCP in
   particular, a single packet flow as identified by the 5-tuple SHOULD
   only be sent to a single care-of address at a time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mobile node may return to the home link through one of its
   interfaces.  There are two options possible for the mobile node when
   it returns home.  Sections 5.5.1 and 5.6 describe the returning-home
   procedures in more detail.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  The mobile node uses only the interface with which it attaches to
       the home link and takes back full ownership of its HoA (home
       address) on the home link.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.  It
       de-registers all bindings with the home agent related to all
       care-of addresses.  The interfaces still attached to the visited
       link(s) are no longer going to be receiving any encapsulated
       traffic from the home agent.  On the other hand, the mobile node
       can continue communicating with the correspondent nodes from the
       other interfaces attached to foreign links by using route
       optimization.  Even if the mobile node is attached to the home
       link, it can still send Binding Updates for other active care-of
       addresses (CoA1 and CoA2) to correspondent nodes.  Since the
       correspondent node has bindings, packets are routed from and to
       each care-of address directly.

   2.  The mobile node may simultaneously use both the interface
       attached to the home link and the interfaces still attached to
       the visited link(s) as shown in Figure 3.  There are two possible
       topologies, depending on whether or not the home agent is the
       only router on the home link.  The operation of Neighbor
       Discovery [RFC4861] is different in the two topologies.  More
       details can be found in Section 5.6.  The home agent and the
       correspondent node have the binding entries listed in Figure 3 in
       their binding cache database in both topologies.  The home agent
       also knows that the mobile node is attached to the home link.
       All the traffic from the Internet is intercepted by the home
       agent first and routed to either the interface attached to the
       home link or to one of the foreign links.  How the home agent
       decides to route a particular flow to the interface attached to
       the home link or foreign link is out of scope for this document.

   This specification keeps backwards compatibility with [RFC3775].  If
   a receiver (either home agent or correspondent node) does not support
   this specification, it does not understand the Binding Identifier
   mobility option.  The receiver skips the unknown mobility option
   (i.e., the Binding Identifier mobility option) and processes the
   Binding Update as defined in [RFC3775].  In order to keep backwards
   compatibility with [RFC3775], when a mobile node sends a Binding
   Update message with extensions described in this document, the
   receiver needs to reflect the Binding Identifier mobility option in
   the Binding Acknowledgement.  If the mobile node finds no Binding
   Identifier mobility options in the received Binding Acknowledgement,
   it assumes the other end node does not support this specification.
   In such case, the mobile node needs to fall back to the legacy
   [RFC3775]-compliant mobile node.  If it is the home registration, the
   mobile node MAY try to discover another home agent that supports the
   Binding Identifier mobility option for the home registration.

   There are two cases when a mobile node might acquire several care-of
   addresses.  A mixture of the two cases is also possible.  Note that a
   mobile node can use BID regardless of the number of interfaces and
   care-of addresses.  Whether or not a mobile node uses BID is

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  A mobile node is using several physical network interfaces and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  A mobile node uses a single physical network interface but
       receives advertisements for multiple prefixes on the link to
       which the interface is attached.  This will result in the mobile
       node configuring several global addresses on the interface from
       each of the announced prefixes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The difference between the above two cases is only in the number of
   physical network interfaces and is therefore irrelevant in this
   document.  What is of significance is the fact that the mobile node

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A mobile node assigns a BID to each care-of address when it wants to
   register them simultaneously with its home address.  The BID MUST be
   unique for a given home address.  The value is an integer between 1
   and 65535.  A zero value SHOULD NOT be used as a BID.  If a mobile
   node has only one care-of address, the assignment of a BID is not
   needed until it has multiple care-of addresses with which to
   register, at which time all of the care-of addresses MUST be mapped
   to BIDs.
   When a mobile node registers a given BID for the first time, it MUST
   include the Care-of Address field in the Binding Identifier mobility
   option.  For any subsequent registrations that either re-register or
   de-register the same BID, the MN need not include the Care-of Address
   field in the Binding Identifier mobility option.

   If the mobile node wants to replace existing registered bindings on
   the home agent with the single binding in the sent Binding Update, it
   sets the 'O' flag.  If the 'O' flag is not set, then the binding will
   be added to existing bindings in the home agent.  The single binding
   will be registered with the assigned BID.  Section 6.2 describes this
   registration procedure in detail.

   Bulk registration is an optimization for binding multiple care-of

   lot of signaling messages through an interface where the bandwidth is
   scarce.  This document specifies bulk registration only for the
   mobile node's home registration.  A mobile node performing bulk
   registration with a correspondent node is out of scope.

   registered for the first time.  This is shown in Figure 7.  The rest

   mobility option is not required.
   If a mobile node wants to delete a particular binding(s) from its
   home agent and correspondent nodes, the mobile node sends a Binding
   Update with lifetime set to zero and includes a Binding Identifier
   mobility option(s) with the BID(s) it wants to de-register.  The
   receiver will remove only the care-of address(es) that match(es) the

      Single Interface

   The mobile node may return to the home link by attaching to the home

   interface it needs to use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5.1"><h4>5.5.1   Using Only the Interface Attached to the Home Link</h4></a>

   The mobile node returns home and de-registers all the bindings it has

   [RFC3775].  After the de-registration step, all the packets routed by
   the home agent are only forwarded to the interface attached to the
   home link, even if there are other active interfaces attached to the
   visited link(s).  While the mobile node de-registers all the bindings

	<a name="section-5.6.1"><h4>5.6.1   Problems of Simultaneous Home and Foreign Attachments</h4></a>

   The mobile node returns home and continues using all the interfaces
   attached to both foreign and home links as shown in Figure 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In [RFC3775], the home agent intercepts packets meant for the mobile
   node using proxy Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] while the mobile node
   is away from the home link.  When the mobile node returns home, the
   home agent deletes the binding cache and stops proxying for the home
   address so that a mobile node can configure its home address on the
   interface attached to the home link.  In this specification, a mobile
   node may return home and configure the home address on the interface
   attached to the home link, but still use the interfaces attached to
   the foreign links.  In this case, a possible conflict arises when
   both the home agent and the mobile node try to defend the home
   address.  If the home agent stops proxying for the home address, the
   packets are always routed to the interface attached to the home link
   and are never routed to the interfaces attached to the visited links.
   Deployments making use of multiple care-of addresses are required to
   avoid configuration conflict between the home agent and the mobile
   node, while still allowing the simultaneous use of home and foreign
   links.  The following describes the mechanism for achieving this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6.2"><h4>5.6.2   Overview and Approach</h4></a>

   The home agent MUST intercept all the packets meant for the mobile
   node, whether or not the mobile node is attached to the home link,
   and decide whether to send the traffic directly to the home address
   on the link or tunnel to the care-of address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two scenarios are illustrated in Figure 3, depending on whether or
   not the home agent is the only router at the home link.  The
   difference is on who defends the home address by (Proxy) Neighbor
   Discovery on the home link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Mobile node defends the home address by the regular Neighbor
       Discovery protocol (illustrated as topology-a in Figure 3).  The
       home agent is the only router on the home link.  Therefore, the
       home agent is capable of intercepting packets without relying on
       the proxy Neighbor Discovery protocol, and the mobile node can
       manage the neighbor cache entry of the home address on the home
       link as a regular IPv6 node.  However, there is one limitation of
       this scenario.  If a correspondent node is located at the home
       link, the home agent may not intercept the packets destined to
       the mobile node.  These packets are routed only via the home
       link, but this is the most optimal path for the mobile node to
       communicate with nodes on the home link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  If there are routers other than the home agent on the home link,
       then it cannot be guaranteed that all packets meant for the
       mobile node are routed to the home agent.  In this case, the
       mobile node MUST NOT operate the Neighbor Discovery protocol for
       the home address on the home link.  This allows the home agent to
       keep using proxy Neighbor Discovery, and thus it keeps receiving
       all the packets sent to the mobile node's home address.  If the
       home agent, according to its local policy, needs to deliver
       packets to the mobile node over the home link, an issue arises
       with respect to how the home agent discovers the mobile node's
       link local address.  This specification uses the Mobility Header
       Link-Layer Address option defined in [RFC5568] in order to carry
       the mobile node's link-layer address in the Binding Update.
       Likewise, the mobile node would also know the link-layer address
       of the default router address to send packets from the home link
       without Neighbor Discovery.  The link-layer address is used to
       transmit packets from and to the mobile node on the home link.
       The packets are transmitted without the Neighbor Discovery
       protocol by constructing the link-layer header manually.  This
       operation is similar to Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] when a mobile node
       sends a de-registration Binding Update to the home agent's link-
       layer address in the operation for returning home.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6.3"><h4>5.6.3   Home Binding Support</h4></a>

   When the home binding is used, the mobile node MUST send a

   lifetime of the home binding, and the Care-of Address field MUST be
   set to the home address.  The mobile node registers only one home

   mobile node).  This link-layer address is required for the home agent
   to send the Binding Acknowledgement and to forward the mobile node's
   packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   According to [RFC3775], the mobile node MUST start responding to

      learn the link-layer address of the next hop (i.e., default router
      of the mobile node).  A mobile node learns the default router's
      link-layer address from a Source Link-Layer Address option in
      Router Advertisements.  The mobile node sends packets directly to
      the default router's link-layer address.  This is done by
      constructing the packet to include a link-layer header with the

   originating node of the Binding Acknowledgement does not support
   processing the Binding Identifier mobility option regardless of

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Figure 10: Binding Bulk Registration for an IPv4 Care-of Address

   When the home agent returns a Binding Acknowledgement for the IPv4
   care-of address registration, it SHOULD NOT use the IPv4 Address
   Acknowledgement mobility option and SHOULD use only the Binding
   Identifier mobility option.  The registration status for the IPv4
   care-of address is stored in the Status field of the Binding
   Identifier mobility option.  However, if the home agent needs to
   store the status value specially defined for the IPv4 Address
   Acknowledgement mobility option, it MUST store the status value in
   the IPv4 Address Acknowledgement mobility option and MUST NOT store
   it in the Binding Identifier mobility option.  In such case, the home
   agent MUST include both the IPv4 Address Acknowledgement mobility
   option and the Binding Identifier mobility option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8.2"><h3>8.2   IPv4 Home Address Management</h3></a>

   When the mobile node wants to configure an IPv4 home address in
   addition to the IPv6 home address, it can request one using the IPv4
   Home Address option in the Binding Update.  If the home agent accepts
   the Binding Update, the mobile node can now register multiple care-of
   addresses for the IPv4 home address in addition to the IPv6 home
   address.  The mobile node MUST always use the IPv4 Home Address
   mobility option for any purposes of the IPv4 home address management.
   The same set of care-of addresses will be registered for both IPv6
   and IPv4 home addresses.  The mobile node cannot bind a different set
   of care-of addresses to each home address.
   According to [RFC5555], the home agent includes the IPv4 Address
   Acknowledgement option in the Binding Acknowledgement only if the
   mobile node had requested an IPv4 home address in the corresponding
   Binding Update.  The IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option MUST be
   present before any Binding Identifier mobility option.  The Status
   field of the IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option contains only the
   error code defined in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5555].  The home agent
   MUST always include the IPv4 Address Acknowledgement mobility option
   in the Binding Acknowledgement for the IPv4 home address
   registration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   IPsec and IKEv2 Interaction</h2></a>

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and the NEMO protocol [RFC3963] require the use
   of IPsec to protect signaling messages, including Binding Updates,
   Binding Acknowledgements, and return routability messages.  IPsec may
   also be used to protect all tunneled data traffic.  The Mobile IPv6-
   IKEv2 specification [RFC4877] specifies how IKEv2 can be used to set
   up the required IPsec security associations.  The following
   assumptions were made in [RFC3775], [RFC3963], and [RFC4877] with
   respect to the use of IKEv2 and IPsec.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  There is only one primary care-of address per mobile node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The primary care-of address is stored in the IPsec database for
      tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  When the home agent receives a packet from the mobile node, the
      source address is verified against the care-of address in the
      corresponding binding cache entry.  If the packet is a reverse-
      tunneled packet from the mobile node, the care-of address check is
      done against the source address on the outer IPv6 header.  The
      reverse-tunneled packet could either be a tunneled Home Test Init
      message or tunneled data traffic to the correspondent node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The mobile node runs IKEv2 (or IKEv1) with the home agent using
      the care-of address.  The IKE SA is based on the care-of address
      of the mobile node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The above assumptions may not be valid when multiple care-of
   addresses are used by the mobile node.  In the following sections,
   the main issues with the use of multiple care-of addresses with IPsec
   are addressed.
	<a name="section-9.1"><h3>9.1   Use of Care-of Address in the IKEv2 Exchange</h3></a>

   For each home address for which the mobile node sets up security
   associations with the home agent, the mobile node must pick one
   care-of address and use that as the source address for all IKEv2
   messages exchanged to create and maintain the IPsec security
   associations associated with the home address.  The resultant IKEv2
   security association is created based on this care-of address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the mobile node needs to change the care-of address, it just sends
   a Binding Update with the care-of address it wants to use, with the
   corresponding Binding Identifier mobility option, and with the 'K'
   bit set.  This will force the home agent to update the IKEv2 security
   association to use the new care-of address.  If the 'K' bit is not
   supported on the mobile node or the home agent, the mobile node MUST
   re-establish the IKEv2 security association with the new care-of
   address.  This will also result in new IPsec security associations
   being set up for the home address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.2"><h3>9.2   Transport Mode IPsec-Protected Messages</h3></a>

   For Mobile IPv6 signaling message protected using IPsec in transport
   mode, the use of a particular care-of address among multiple care-of
   addresses does not matter for IPsec processing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The home agent processes Mobile Prefix Discovery messages with the
   same rules of data packets described in Section 6.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.3"><h3>9.3   Tunnel Mode IPsec-Protected Messages</h3></a>

   The use of IPsec in tunnel mode with multiple care-of addresses
   introduces a few issues that require changes to how the mobile node
   and the home agent send and receive tunneled traffic.  The route
   optimization mechanism described in [RFC3775] mandates the use of
   IPsec protection in tunnel mode for the Home Test Init and Home Test
   messages.  The mobile node and the home agent may also choose to
   protect all reverse-tunneled payload traffic with IPsec in tunnel
   mode.  The following sections address multiple care-of address
   support for these two types of messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.3.1"><h4>9.3.1   Tunneled Home Test Init and Home Test Messages</h4></a>

   The mobile node MAY use the same care-of address for all Home Test
   Init messages sent reverse tunneled through the home agent.  The
   mobile node may use the same care-of address irrespective of which
   correspondent node the Home Test Init message is being to.  RFC 3775
   requires the home agent to verify that the mobile node is using the
   care-of address that is in the binding cache entry when it receives a
   reverse-tunneled Home Test Init message.  If a different address is
   used as the source address, the message is silently dropped by the
   home agent.  This document requires the home agent implementation to
   decapsulate and forward the Home Test Init message as long as the
   source address is one of the care-of addresses in the binding cache
   entry for the mobile node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the home agent tunnels a Home Test message to the mobile node,
   the care-of address used in the outer IPv6 header is not relevant to
   the Home Test message.  So regular IPsec tunnel encapsulation with
   the care-of address known to the IPsec implementation on the home
   agent is sufficient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9.3.2"><h4>9.3.2   Tunneled Payload Traffic</h4></a>

   When the mobile node sends and receives multiple traffic flows
   protected by IPsec to different care-of addresses, the use of the
   correct care-of address for each flow becomes important.  Support for
   this requires the following two considerations on the home agent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  When the home agent receives a reverse-tunneled payload message
      protected by IPsec in tunnel mode, the source address used in the
      outer IPv6 header is irrelevant to IPsec, since the tunnel mode
      security association is based on the addresses in the inner IPv6
      header.  Therefore, the same IPsec security association can be
      used for payload traffic tunneled from any of the care-of
      addresses.  Note that the care-of address used in the reverse-
      tunneled traffic can be different from the care-of address used as
      the source address in the IKEv2 exchange.  However, this does not
      cause an issue due to the above-mentioned reason.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  For tunneled IPsec traffic from the home agent to the mobile node,
      the IPsec implementation on the home agent will not be aware of
      which care-of address to use when performing IPsec tunnel
      encapsulation.  The Mobile IP stack on the home agent, based on
      the binding cache entries created by the mobile node, knows to
      which care-of address the packet belonging to a particular flow
      needs to be tunneled.  The destination address for the outer IP
      header must either be conveyed dynamically per packet to the IPsec
      stack when it performs the encapsulation or the Mobile IPv6 stack
      must get access to the packet after IPsec processing is done and
      modify the destination address.  The first option requires changes
      to the IPsec implementation.  In the second option, there is a
      need for special processing in the forwarding function to replace
      the destination address on the outer header with the correct
      care-of address.  The exact technique to achieve the above is
      implementation specific.
	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The security considerations for securing the Binding Update and
   Binding Acknowledgement messages with multiple care-of addresses are
   very similar to the security considerations for securing the Binding
   Update and Binding Acknowledgement.  Please see [RFC3775] for more
   information.  The Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages
   with multiple care-of addresses are securely exchanged as described
   in [RFC3775], [RFC4877], and Section 9 of this document.  Additional
   security considerations are described below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With simultaneous binding support, it is possible for a malicious
   mobile node to successfully bind a number of victims' addresses as
   valid care-of addresses for the mobile node with its home agent.
   Once these addresses have been bound, the malicious mobile node can
   perform a re-direction attack by instructing the home agent (e.g.,
   setting filtering rules to direct a large file transfer) to tunnel
   packets to the victims' addresses.  Such risk is highlighted in
   [MIP6ANALYSIS].  These attacks are possible because the care-of
   addresses sent by the mobile node in the Binding Update messages are
   not verified by the home agent, i.e., the home agent does not check
   if the mobile node is at the care-of address at which it claims to
   be.  The security model for Mobile IPv6 assumes that there is a trust
   relationship between the mobile node and its home agent.  Any
   malicious attack by the mobile node is traceable by the home agent.
   This acts as a deterrent for the mobile node to launch such attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although such a risk exists in Mobile IPv6, the risk level is
   increased when simultaneous multiple care-of address bindings are
   performed.  In Mobile IPv6, a mobile node can only have a single
   care-of address binding per home address at a given time.  However,
   for simultaneous multiple care-of address bindings, a mobile node can
   have more than one care-of address binding per home address at a
   given time.  This implies that a mobile node using simultaneous
   binding support can effectively bind more than a single victim's
   address.  Another difference is the degree of risk involved.  In the
   single care-of address binding case, once the re-direction attack is
   initiated, a malicious mobile node would be unable to use its home
   address for communications (such as to receive control packets
   pertaining to the file transfer).  However, in the simultaneous
   binding support case, a malicious mobile node could bind a valid
   care-of address in addition to multiple victims addresses.  This
   valid care-of address could then be used by the malicious mobile node
   to set up flow filtering rules at its home agent, thereby controlling
   and/or launching new re-direction attacks.
   Thus, in view of such risks, it is advisable for a home agent to
   employ some form of care-of address verification mechanism before
   using the care-of addresses as a valid routing path to a mobile node.
   These mechanisms are out of scope for this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the binding registration of Mobile IPv6, a care-of address is
   always verified by its reachability by a home agent.  This
   reachability test may decrease the above risks.  However, when bulk
   registration is used, a home agent cannot verify reachability of
   care-of addresses carried in a Binding Identifier mobility option.
   Therefore, the home agent can choose to reject bulk registration by
   using [MCOA BULK REGISTRATION PROHIBITED] in a Binding
   Acknowledgement.  Alternatively, when a mobile node first registers a
   care-of address, it uses the individual Binding Updates for the first
   appeared care-of address.  During the initial binding registration, a
   home agent can verify the address reachability for that given care-of
   address.  After that, the mobile node uses bulk registration to
   refresh the care-of address.
