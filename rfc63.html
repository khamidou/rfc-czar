                     Belated Network Meeting Report

On 8 May 1970, a Network Working Group meeting was hosted at Lincoln Labs.
The topics under discussion were:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1)   Lincoln Lab's Local Interaction Language (LIL)

   2)   Records, Messages, and Format in HOST-HOST information exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3)   Miscellaneous gripes

The first topic is thoroughly summarized in Lincoln Lab's Semi annual
Technical Summary titled "Graphics", dated May 31, 1970 (document id.
ESD-TR-70-151).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The second topic involved considerable  discussion of NWG/RFC #42 in which
it was proposed that all messages be preceded by an 8-bit type byte which
would declare the format of the message which followed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The following decisions were reached:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   a)   Records may begin anywhere within a message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   b)   The first 8 bits of a record are reserved for type information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   c)   The first transmission on a connection starts a record.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Type 0 is agreed to mean that the transmission that follows consists of an
arbitrarily long record, and that no further type bytes will be present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">The notions of messages and records are independent of the flow-control
protocol.  Thus the receipt of a message does not carry any semantic
importance.  The receipt of a record, however, may initiate some interpre-
tation process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">After some discussion, the proposals in NWG/RFC #42 were permuted as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   type 0 = bit string of arbitrary length follows

   type 1 = 8-bit ASCII follows

   type 2 = EBCDIC follows

   type 3 = MOD 33 TTY 7-bit ASCII

   type 4 = YOUR Local
            followed by another type byte

   type 5 = MY Local
            followed by another type byte

The praise or blame for the preceding decisions rests on the attendees at
the meeting, to wit:

will be receiving them.
