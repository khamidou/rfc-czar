	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   The SNMP Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
       [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
       58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,
       RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the
       SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
       and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
       protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
       RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
       and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [RFC2575].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  The
   textual conventions defined in this MIB module cannot be translated
   to SMIv1 since the Counter64 type does not exist in SMIv1.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overview</h2></a>

   The Structure of Management Information [RFC2578] does not explicitly
   address the question of how to represent integer objects other than
   counters that would require up to 64 bits to provide the necessary
   range and precision.  There are MIBs in progress targeted for the
   standards track, which need such data types. This memo specifies a
   short term solution, using textual conventions, to meet these needs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Short Term and Long Term Objectives</h3></a>

   There is an immediate need to provide a Gauge64 data type, similar in
   semantics to the Gauge32 data type, in order to support common data
   representations such as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  a snapshot of a Counter64 at a given moment, e.g., history ring
      buffer

   -  the difference between two Counter64 values

   There is also an immediate need for a 64-bit zero-based counter type,
   similar in semantics to the ZeroBasedCounter32 TC defined in the
   RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both of these textual conventions should use a base type of Gauge64
   or Unsigned64, but such a base type is not available.  Until such a
   base type is defined and deployed, these temporary textual
   conventions (which use a base type of Counter64) will be used in MIBs
   which require unsigned 64-bit data types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to be backward compatible with existing implementations of
   Counter64, the ASN.1 encoding of unsigned 64-bit data types must be
   identical to the encoding of Counter64 objects, i.e., identified by
   the [APPLICATION 6] ASN.1 tag.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the textual conventions defined in this document represent
   a limited and short-term solution to the problem.  These textual
   conventions may be deprecated as a long term solution is defined and
   deployed to replace them.  A MIB object which uses either of these
   textual conventions may also eventually have to be deprecated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Limitations of the Textual Convention Approach</h3></a>

   New unsigned data types with textual conventions based on the
   Counter64 tag, instead of a new (or other existing) ASN.1 tag have
   some limitations:
   -  The MAX-ACCESS of the TC must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS
      of the underlying Counter64 type is read-only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  No sub-range can be specified on the TC-derived types, because
      sub-ranges are not allowed on Counter64 objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  No DEFVAL clause can be specified for the TC-derived types,
      because DEFVALs are not allowed on Counter64 objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The TC-derived types cannot be used in an INDEX clause, because
      there is no INDEX clause mapping defined for objects of type
      Counter64.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   New Textual Conventions</h2></a>

   The following textual conventions are defined to support unsigned
   64-bit data types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   CounterBasedGauge64</h3></a>

   This textual convention defines a 64-bit gauge, but defined with
   Counter64 syntax, since no Gauge64 or Unsigned64 base type is
   available in SMIv2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This TC is used for storing the difference between two Counter64
   values, or simply storing a snapshot of a Counter64 value at a given
   moment in time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   ZeroBasedCounter64</h3></a>

   This textual convention defines a 64-bit counter with an initial
   value of zero, instead of an arbitrary initial value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This TC is used for counter objects in tables which are instantiated
   by management application action.

            is meant to be deprecated as a long-term solution
            is deployed."

     ::= { mib-2 78 }

   CounterBasedGauge64 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
           "The CounterBasedGauge64 type represents a non-negative
           integer, which may increase or decrease, but shall never
           exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum value. The
           maximum value can not be greater than 2^64-1
           (18446744073709551615 decimal), and the minimum value can
           not be smaller than 0.  The value of a CounterBasedGauge64
           has its maximum value whenever the information being modeled
           is greater than or equal to its maximum value, and has its
           minimum value whenever the information being modeled is
           smaller than or equal to its minimum value.  If the
           information being modeled subsequently decreases below
           (increases above) the maximum (minimum) value, the
           CounterBasedGauge64 also decreases (increases).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
           because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap' semantics
           associated with the Counter64 base type are not preserved.
           It is possible that management applications which rely
           solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to determine object
           semantics will mistakenly operate upon objects of this type
           as they would for Counter64 objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           This textual convention represents a limited and short-term
           solution, and may be deprecated as a long term solution is
           defined and deployed to replace it."
     SYNTAX Counter64


   ZeroBasedCounter64 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
           "This TC describes an object which counts events with the
           following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
           zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate<br>
           events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^64 is<br>
           reached.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Provided that an application discovers the new object within
           the minimum time to wrap it can use the initial value as a
           delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
           part.  It is important for a management station to be aware
           of this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and
           to discard data if the actual time is too long or there is
           no defined minimum time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Typically this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
           constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in
           use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Note that this textual convention does not retain all the
           semantics of the Counter64 base type. Specifically, a
           Counter64 has an arbitrary initial value, but objects
           defined with this TC are required to start at the value
           zero.  This behavior is not likely to have any adverse
           effects on management applications which are expecting
           Counter64 semantics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           This textual convention represents a limited and short-term
           solution, and may be deprecated as a long term solution is
           defined and deployed to replace it."
