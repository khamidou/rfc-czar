	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used to
   schedule management operations periodically or at specified dates and
   times.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The SNMP Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
      [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
      58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
      2580 [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the
      SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
      and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol
      is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572
      [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].
   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
      and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [RFC2575].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   The MIB defined in this memo provides the scheduling of actions
   periodically or at specified dates and times.  The actions can be
   used to realize on-duty / off-duty schedules or to trigger management
   functions in a distributed management application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Schedules can be enabled or disabled by modifying a control object.
   This allows for pre-configured schedules which are activated or
   deactivated by some other management functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The term `scheduler' is used throughout this memo to refer to the
   entity which implements the scheduling MIB and which invokes the
   actions at the specified points in time.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Periodic Schedules</h3></a>

   Periodic schedules are based on fixed time periods between the
   initiation of scheduled actions.  Periodic schedules are defined by
   specifying the number of seconds between two initiations.  The time
   needed to complete the action is usually not known by the scheduler
   and does therefore not influence the next scheduling point.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementations must guarantee that action invocations will not occur
   before their next scheduled time.  However, implementations may be
   forced to delay invocations in the face of local constraints (e.g., a
   heavy load on higher-priority tasks).  An accumulation of such delays
   would result in a drift of the scheduling interval with respect to
   time, and should be avoided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Scheduled actions collecting statistical data should retrieve time
   stamps from the data source and not rely on the accuracy of the
   periodic scheduler in order to obtain accurate statistics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Calendar Schedules</h3></a>

   Calendar schedules trigger scheduled actions at specified days of the
   week and days of the month.  Calendar schedules are therefore aware
   of the notion of months, days, weekdays, hours and minutes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible to specify multiple values for each calendar item.
   This provides a mechanism for defining complex schedules.  For
   example, a schedule could be defined which triggers an action every
   15 minutes on a given weekday.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Months, days and weekdays are specified using the objects schedMonth,
   schedDay and schedWeekDay of type BITS.  Setting multiple bits to one
   in these objects causes an OR operation.  For example, setting the
   bits monday(1) and friday(5) in schedWeekDay restricts the schedule<br>
   to Mondays and Fridays.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bit fields for schedMonth, schedDay and schedWeekDay are combined
   using an AND operation.  For example, setting the bits june(5) and<br>
   july(6) in schedMonth and combining it with the bits monday(1) and<br>
   friday(5) set in schedWeekDay will result in a schedule which is<br>
   restricted to every Monday and Friday in the months June and July.
   Wildcarding of calendar items is achieved by setting all bits to one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible to define calendar schedules that will never trigger
   an action.  For example, one can define a calendar schedule which
   should trigger an action on February 31st.  Schedules like this will
   simply be ignored by the scheduler.
   Finally, calendar schedules are always expressed in local time.  A
   scalar, schedLocalTime, is provided so that a manager can retrieve
   the notion of local time and the offset to GMT time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   One-shot Schedules</h3></a>

   One-shot Schedules are similar to calendar schedules.  The difference
   between a calendar schedule and a one-shot schedule is that a one-
   shot schedule will automatically disable itself once an action has
   been invoked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Time Transitions</h3></a>

   A time transition occurs when the Schedule MIB's notion of time (as
   reported by schedLocalTime) is changed so that time continuity is
   lost.  Time transitions may be caused by daylight savings times or
   administrative changes of the system's notion of time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two possible situations when a time transition occurs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   First, time may be set backwards, in which case particular times will
   appear to occur twice.  These are called 'ambiguous times'.  Second,
   time may be set forwards, in which case particular times will not
   occur.  These are called 'nonexistent times'.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an action is configured in the Schedule MIB to occur at an
   ambiguous time, the action will be invoked at all occurrences of the
   ambiguous time.  For example, if an action is scheduled to occur at
   2:10 am, and a time transition occurs at 3:00 am which sets the clock
   back to 2:00 am, the action will be invoked twice.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an action is configured in the Schedule MIB to occur at a
   nonexistent time, the action will not be invoked at all.  For
   example, if an action is scheduled to occur at 2:10 am, and a time
   transition occurs at 2:00 am which sets the clock to 3:00 am, the
   action will not be invoked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.5"><h3>3.5   Actions</h3></a>

   Scheduled actions are modeled by SNMP set operations on local MIB
   variables.  Scheduled actions described in this MIB are further
   restricted to objects of type INTEGER.  This restriction does not
   limit the usefulness of the MIB.  Simple schedules such as on-duty /
   off-duty schedules for resources that have a status MIB object (e.g.
   ifAdminStatus) are possible.
   More complex actions can be realized by triggering a management
   script which is responsible for performing complex state transitions.
   A management script can also be used to perform SNMP set operations
   on remote SNMP engines.

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Usage Examples</h2></a>

   This section presents some examples how the scheduling MIB can be
   used to schedule scripts with the Script MIB [RFC3165] or to realize
   on-duty/off-duty schedules by modifying status objects of other MIB
   modules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Starting a script to ping devices every 20 minutes</h3></a>

   It is assumed that the schedule entry is owned by schedOwner = "joe"
   and its name is schedName = "ping".  The instance identifier for the
   scheduling entry is therefore 3.106.111.101.4.112.105.110.103.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is further assumed that the smLaunchTable entry is owned by
   smLaunchOwner = "joe" and its name is smLaunchName = "ping-devs".

   The script lives in the context identified by the string "engine1".

   A similar configuration could be used to control other schedules.
   For example, one could change the "if-on" and "if-off" schedules to
   enable and disable the periodic scheduler defined in the first
   example.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Scheduled SNMP set operations must use the security credentials that
   were present when the corresponding row in the scheduling entry was
   created.  An implementation must therefore record and maintain the
   credentials for every scheduling entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An implementation must ensure that access control rules are applied
   when doing the set operation.  This is accomplished by calling the
   isAccessAllowed abstract service interface defined in RFC 2571
   [RFC2571]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      statusInformation =          -- success or errorIndication
        isAccessAllowed(
        IN   securityModel         -- Security Model in use
        IN   securityName          -- principal who wants to access
        IN   securityLevel         -- Level of Security
        IN   viewType              -- read, write, or notify view
        IN   contextName           -- context containing variableName
        IN   variableName          -- OID for the managed object
             )

   The securityModel, securityName and securityLevel parameters are set
   to the values that were recorded when the scheduling entry was
   created.  The viewType parameter must select the write view and the
   contextName and variableName parameters are taken from the
   schedContextName and schedVariableName values of the scheduling
   entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This MIB limits scheduled actions to objects in the local MIB.  This
   avoids security problems with the delegation of access rights.
   However, it might be possible for a user of this MIB to own some
   schedules that might trigger far in the future.  This can cause
   security risks if the security administrator did not properly update
   the access control lists when a user is withdrawn from an SNMP
   engine.  Therefore, entries in the schedTable SHOULD be cleaned up
   whenever a user is removed from an SNMP engine.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security
   administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)
   defined in RFC 2575 [RFC2575] for tables in which multiple users may
   need to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is
   used as an "owner index".  Such an initial index has a syntax of
   SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName
   or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security
   policy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will
   have the same value for this initial index.  For a given user's
   entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the
   information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers
   (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
   owner index.  To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of
   the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the
   value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion,
   and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
   More elaborate configurations are possible.
