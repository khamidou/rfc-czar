           Generalized Labels for Lambda-Switch-Capable (LSC)
                        Label Switching Routers

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving, and, as a
   consequence, new equipment providing lambda switching capability has
   been developed and is currently being deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is a family of protocols that can be used to
   operate networks built from a range of technologies including
   wavelength (or lambda) switching.  For this purpose, GMPLS defined a
   wavelength label as only having significance between two neighbors.
   Global wavelength semantics are not considered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to facilitate interoperability in a network composed of next
   generation lambda-switch-capable equipment, this document defines a
   standard lambda label format that is compliant with the Dense
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and Coarse Wavelength

   Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector.
   The label format defined in this document can be used in GMPLS

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   As described in [RFC3945], GMPLS extends MPLS from supporting only
   Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to also
   supporting four new classes of interfaces and switching:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC)

   o Time-Division Multiplex (TDM) Capable

   o Lambda Switch Capable (LSC)

   o Fiber Switch Capable (FSC)

   A functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed
   to support new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document presents details that are specific to the use of GMPLS
   with LSC equipment.  Technologies such as Reconfigurable Optical
   Add/Drop Multiplex (ROADM) and Wavelength Cross-Connect (WXC) operate
   at the wavelength switching level.  [RFC3471] states that wavelength
   labels "only have significance between two neighbors" (Section
   3.2.1.1); global wavelength semantics are not considered.  In order
   to facilitate interoperability in a network composed of LSC
   equipment, this document defines a standard lambda label format,
   which is compliant with both the Dense Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (DWDM) grid [G.694.1] and the Coarse Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (CWDM) grid [G.694.2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Conventions Used in This Document</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Assumed Network Model and Related Problem Statement</h2></a>

   Figure 1 depicts an all-optical switched network consisting of
   different vendors' optical network domains.  Vendor A's network
   consists of ROADM or WXC, and Vendor B's network consists of a number
   of Photonic Cross-Connects (PXCs) and DWDM multiplexers and
   demultiplexers.  Otherwise, both vendors' networks might be based on
   the same technology.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this case, the use of standardized wavelength label information is
   quite significant to establish a wavelength-based Label Switched Path
   (LSP).  It is also an important constraint when calculating the
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) for use by Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Resource ReserVation Protocol -
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling [RFC3473].  The way the CSPF
   is performed is outside the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Needless to say, an LSP must be appropriately provisioned between a
   selected pair of ports not only within Domain A but also over
   multiple domains satisfying wavelength constraints.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Figure 2 illustrates the interconnection between Domain A and Domain
   B in detail.

      Figure 2.  Interconnecting Details between Two Domains

   In the scenario of Figure 1, consider the setting up of a
   bidirectional LSP from ingress switch (Node-1) to egress switch
   (Node-9) using GMPLS RSVP-TE.  In order to satisfy wavelength
   continuity constraints, a fixed wavelength (lambda 1) needs to be
   used in Domain A and Domain B.  A Path message will be used for
   signaling.  The Path message will contain an Upstream_Label object
   and a Label_Set object, both containing the same value.  The
   Label_Set object shall contain a single sub-channel that must be the
   same as the Upstream_Label object.  The Path setup will continue
   downstream to egress switch (Node-9) by configuring each lambda
   switch based on the wavelength label.  If a node has a tunable
   wavelength transponder, the tuning wavelength is considered a part of
   the wavelength switching operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Not using a standardized label would add undue burden on the operator
   to enforce policy as each manufacturer may decide on a different
   representation; therefore, each domain may have its own label
   formats.  Moreover, manual provisioning may lead to misconfiguration
   if domain-specific labels are used.
   Therefore, a wavelength label should be standardized in order to
   allow interoperability between multiple domains; otherwise,
   appropriate existing labels are identified in support of wavelength
   availability.  Containing identical wavelength information, the ITU-T
   DWDM frequency grid specified in [G.694.1] and the CWDM wavelength
   information in [G.694.2] are used by Label Switching Routers (LSRs)
   and should be followed for wavelength labels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Label-Related Formats</h2></a>

   To deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical switching
   and time division multiplexing domains, several new forms of "label"
   have been defined in [RFC3471].  This section contains a definition
   of a wavelength label based on [G.694.1] or [G.694.2] for use by LSC
   LSRs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Wavelength Labels</h3></a>

   Section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471] defines wavelength labels: "values used
   in this field only have significance between two neighbors, and the
   receiver may need to convert the received value into a value that has
   local significance".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We do not need to define a new type as the information stored is
   either a port label or a wavelength label.  Only the wavelength label
   needs to be defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   LSC equipment uses multiple wavelengths controlled by a single
   control channel.  In such a case, the label indicates the wavelength
   to be used for the LSP.  This document defines a standardized
   wavelength label format.  For examples of wavelength values, refer to
   [G.694.1], which lists the frequencies from the ITU-T DWDM frequency
   grid.  For CWDM technology, refer to the wavelength values defined in
   [G.694.2].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since the ITU-T DWDM grid is based on nominal central frequencies, we
   need to indicate the appropriate table, the channel spacing in the
   grid, and a value n that allows the calculation of the frequency.
   That value can be positive or negative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The frequency is calculated as such in [G.694.1]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz)

   Where "n" is a two's-complement integer (positive, negative, or 0)
   and "channel spacing" is defined to be 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1
   THz.  When wider channel spacing such as 0.2 THz is utilized, the
   combination of narrower channel spacing and the value "n" can provide
   proper frequency with that channel spacing.  Channel spacing is not
   utilized to indicate the LSR capability but only to specify a
   frequency in signaling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For other cases that use the ITU-T CWDM grid, the spacing between
   different channels is defined as 20 nm, so we need to express the
   wavelength value in nanometers (nm).  Examples of CWDM wavelengths in
   nm are 1471, 1491, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The wavelength is calculated as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Wavelength (nm) = 1471 nm + n * 20 nm

   Where "n" is a two's-complement integer (positive, negative, or 0).
   The grids listed in [G.694.1] and [G.694.2] are not numbered and
   change with the changing frequency spacing as technology advances, so
   an index is not appropriate in this case.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   DWDM Wavelength Label</h3></a>

   subobjects.  The sole special case occurs when this label format is
   used in a label Explicit Route Object (ERO) subobject.  In this case,
   the special value of zero (0) means that the referenced node MAY<br>

Appendix A.  DWDM Example

   Considering the network displayed in Figure 1, it is possible to show
   an example of LSP setup using the lambda labels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Node 1 receives the request for establishing an LSP from itself to
   Node 9.  The ITU-T grid to be used is the DWDM one, the channel
   spacing is 50 Ghz, and the wavelength to be used is 193,35 THz.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Node 1 signals the LSP via a Path message including a wavelength
   label structured as defined in Section 3.2:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   |Grid |  C.S. |   Identifier    |              n                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Grid = 1 : ITU-T DWDM grid

   C.S. = 2 : 50 GHz channel spacing

   n    = 5 :

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz)

        193.35 (THz) = 193.1 (THz) + n* 0.05 (THz)

        n = (193.35-193.1)/0.05 = 5

Appendix B.  CWDM Example

   The network displayed in Figure 1 can also be used to display an
   example of signaling using the wavelength label in a CWDM
   environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This time, the signaling of an LSP from Node 4 to Node 7 is
   considered.  Such LSP exploits the CWDM ITU-T grid with a 20 nm
   channel spacing and is established using a wavelength equal to 1331
   nm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Node 4 signals the LSP via a Path message including a wavelength
   label structured as defined in Section 3.3:
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Grid |  C.S. |   Identifier    |              n                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Grid = 2 : ITU-T CWDM grid

   C.S. = 1 : 20 nm channel spacing

   n    = -7 :

</p>        Wavelength (nm) = 1471 nm + n * 20 nm

        1331 (nm) = 1471 (nm) + n * 20 nm

        n = (1331-1471)/20 = -7
