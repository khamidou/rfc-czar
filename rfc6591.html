	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Abuse Reporting Format [ARF] defines a message format for sending
   reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, with an eye towards
   automating both the generation and consumption of those reports.
   There is now also a desire to extend the ARF to include the reporting
   of messages that fail to authenticate using known message
   authentication methods, such as DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] and
   Sender Policy Framework [SPF], as these are sometimes evidence of
   abuse that can be detected and reported through automated means.  The
   same mechanism can be used to convey forensic information about the
   specific reason the authentication method failed.  Thus, this memo
   presents such extensions to ARF that allow for detailed reporting of
   message authentication method failures.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Definitions</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Key Words</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Email Architecture</h3></a>

   This memo uses some terms whose definitions and descriptions can be
   found in [EMAIL-ARCH].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Base64</h3></a>

   Base64 is defined in Section 4 of [BASE64].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The values that are base64 encodings MAY contain folding whitespace
   (FWS) for formatting purposes as per the usual header field wrapping
   defined in [MAIL].  During decoding, any characters not in the base64
   alphabet are ignored so that such line wrapping does not harm the
   value.  The ABNF token "FWS" is defined in [DKIM].  No other
   extensions to the valid base64 character set are permitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Technologies</h3></a>

   There are technologies in email security that provide authentication
   services and some that do authorization.  These are often conflated.
   A discussion that is useful for establishing context can be found in
   Section 1.5.2 of [AUTH-RESULTS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   ARF Extension for Authentication Failure Reporting</h2></a>

   The current report format defined in [ARF] lacks some specific
   features required to do effective email authentication failure
   reporting.  This section defines extensions to ARF to accommodate
   this requirement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A single report describes a single email authentication failure.
   Multiple reports MAY be used to report multiple failures for a single
   message.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   New ARF Feedback Type</h3></a>

   A new feedback type, "auth-failure", is defined in this document as
   an extension, per Section 7.3 of [ARF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A message that uses this feedback type has the following modified
   header field requirements for the second (machine-parseable) [MIME]
   part of the report:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Authentication-Results:  Syntax as specified in [AUTH-RESULTS].
      Furthermore, [ARF] specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at
      most once; for this extension, this field MUST be present, but it
      MUST reflect only a single authentication method's result.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Original-Envelope-Id:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore,
      [ARF] specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at most once;
      for this extension, this field's inclusion is RECOMMENDED, where
      that value is available, to aid in diagnosing the authentication
      failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Original-Mail-From:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore,
      [ARF] specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at most once;
      for this extension, this field's inclusion is RECOMMENDED, where
      that value is available, to aid in diagnosing the authentication
      failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Source-IP:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore, [ARF]
      specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at most once; for
      this extension, this field's inclusion is RECOMMENDED, where that
      value is available, to aid in diagnosing the authentication
      failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reported-Domain:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore, [ARF]
      specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at most once; for
      this extension, this field MUST be present if such a value is
      available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Delivery-Result:  As specified in Section 3.2.2.  This field is
      OPTIONAL, but it MUST NOT appear more than once.  If present, it
      SHOULD indicate the outcome of the message in some meaningful way,
      but it MAY be set to "other" for local policy reasons.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The third MIME part of the message is either of type "message/rfc822"
   (as defined in [MIME-TYPES]) or of type "text/rfc822-headers" (as
   defined in [REPORT]) and contains a copy of the entire header block
   from the original message.  This part MUST be included (contrary to
   [REPORT], which makes it optional).
   For privacy reasons, report generators might need to redact portions
   of a reported message, such as an identifier or address associated
   with the end user whose complaint action resulted in the report.  A
   discussion of relevant issues and a suggested method for doing so can
   be found in [RFC6590].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   New ARF Header Field Names</h3></a>

   The following new ARF field names are defined as extensions to
   Section 3.1 of [ARF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1   Required for All Reports</h4></a>

   Auth-Failure:  Indicates the failure from an email authentication
      method that is being reported.  The list of valid values is
      enumerated in Section 3.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2   Optional for All Reports</h4></a>

   Delivery-Result:  The final message disposition that was enacted by
      the ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) generating the report.
      It MUST NOT appear more than once.  Possible values are as
      follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      delivered:  The message was delivered (not specific as to where).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      spam:  The message was delivered to the recipient's spam folder
         (or equivalent).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      policy:  The message was not delivered to the intended inbox due
         to a failure from an email authentication method.  The specific
         action taken is not specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      reject:  The message was rejected.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      other:  The message had a final disposition not covered by one of
         the above values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.3"><h4>3.2.3   Required for DKIM Reports</h4></a>

   DKIM-Domain:  The domain that signed the message, taken from the "d="
      tag of the signature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DKIM-Identity:  The identity of the signature that failed
      verification, taken from the "i=" tag of the signature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DKIM-Selector:  The selector of the signature that failed
      verification, taken from the "s=" tag of the signature.
	<a name="section-3.2.4"><h4>3.2.4   Optional for DKIM Reports</h4></a>

   DKIM-Canonicalized-Header:  A base64 encoding of the canonicalized
      header of the message as generated by the verifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DKIM-Canonicalized-Body:  A base64 encoding of the canonicalized body
      of the message as generated by the verifier.  The encoded content
      MUST be limited to those octets that contribute to the DKIM body
      hash (i.e., the value of the "l=" tag; see Section 3.7 of [DKIM]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If DKIM-Canonicalized-Header and DKIM-Canonicalized-Body encode
   redacted data, they MUST NOT be included.  Otherwise, they SHOULD be
   included.  The data presented there have to be exactly the
   canonicalized header and body as defined by [DKIM] and computed at
   the verifier.  This is because these fields are intended to aid in
   identifying message alterations that invalidate DKIM signatures in
   transit.  Including redacted data in them renders the data unusable.
   (See also Sections 3.1 and 6.6 for further discussion.)

	<a name="section-3.2.5"><h4>3.2.5   Required for ADSP Reports</h4></a>

   DKIM-ADSP-DNS:  Includes the Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP)
      policy used to obtain the verifier's ADSP result.  This MUST be
      formatted per Section 4.2.1 of [ADSP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.6"><h4>3.2.6   Required for SPF Reports</h4></a>

   SPF-DNS:  This field MUST appear once for every SPF record [SPF] used
      to obtain the SPF result.  It MUST include the DNS RRTYPE used,
      the DNS domain from which the record was retrieved, and the
      content of that record.  The syntax is defined in Section 4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Authentication Failure Types</h3></a>

   The list of defined email authentication failure types used in the
   "Auth-Failure:" header field (defined above), is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   adsp:  The message did not conform to the author domain's published
      [ADSP] signing practices.  The DKIM-ADSP-DNS field MUST be
      included in the report.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   bodyhash:  The body hash in the signature and the body hash computed
      by the verifier did not match.  The DKIM-Canonicalized-Body field
      SHOULD be included in the report (see Section 3.2.4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   revoked:  The DKIM key referenced by the signature on the message has
      been revoked.  The DKIM-Domain and DKIM-Selector fields MUST be
      included in the report.
   signature:  The DKIM signature on the message did not successfully
      verify against the header hash and public key.  The DKIM-Domain
      and DKIM-Selector fields MUST be included in the report, and the
      DKIM-Canonicalized-Header field SHOULD be included in the report
      (see Section 3.2.4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   spf:  The evaluation of the author domain's SPF record produced a
      "none", "fail", "softfail", "temperror", or "permerror" result.
      ("none" is not strictly a failure per [SPF], but a service that
      demands successful SPF evaluations of clients could treat it like
      a failure.)

   Supplementary data MAY be included in the form of comments compliant
   with [MAIL].  For example, "Auth-Failure: adsp" could be augmented by
   a comment to indicate that the failed message was rejected because it
   was not signed when it should have been.  See Appendix B for an
   example.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Syntax for Added ARF Header Fields</h2></a>

   The [ABNF] definitions for the new fields are as follows:

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security issues with respect to these reports are similar to those
   found in [DSN].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Inherited Considerations</h3></a>

   Implementers are advised to consider the Security Considerations
   sections of [DKIM], [ADSP], [SPF], and [ARF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Forgeries</h3></a>

   These reports can be forged as easily as ordinary Internet electronic
   mail.  User agents and automatic mail-handling facilities (such as
   mail distribution list exploders) that wish to make automatic use of
   Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) of any kind should take
   appropriate precautions to minimize the potential damage from denial-
   of-service attacks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Security threats related to forged DSNs include the sending of

   a.  A falsified email authentication method failure notification when
       the message was in fact delivered to the indicated recipient;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   b.  Falsified signature information, such as selector, domain, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Perhaps the simplest means of mitigating this threat is to assert
   that these reports should themselves be signed with something like
   DKIM.  On the other hand, if there's a problem with the DKIM
   infrastructure at the verifier, signing DKIM failure reports might
   produce reports that aren't trusted or even accepted by their
   intended recipients.
	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Automatic Generation</h3></a>

   Automatic generation of these reports by verifying agents can cause a
   denial-of-service attack when a large volume of email is sent that
   causes email authentication failures for whatever reason.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Limiting the rate of generation of these messages might be
   appropriate but threatens to inhibit the distribution of important
   and possibly time-sensitive information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is suggested that report
   generators only create these (or any) ARF reports after an out-of-
   band arrangement has been made between two parties.  This mechanism
   then becomes a way to adjust parameters of an authorized abuse report
   feedback loop that is configured and activated by private agreement
   rather than starting to send them automatically based solely on
   discovered data in the DNS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.4"><h3>6.4   Envelope Sender Selection</h3></a>

   In the case of transmitted reports in the form of a new message, it
   is necessary to consider the construction and transmission of the
   message so as to avoid amplification attacks, deliberate or
   otherwise.  See Section 5 of [ARF] for further information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.5"><h3>6.5   Reporting Multiple Incidents</h3></a>

   If it is known that a particular host generates abuse reports upon
   certain incidents, an attacker could forge a high volume of messages
   that will trigger such a report.  The recipient of the report could
   then be inundated with reports.  This could easily be extended to a
   distributed denial-of-service attack by finding a number of report-
   generating servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The incident count referenced in [ARF] provides a limited form of
   mitigation.  The host generating reports may elect to send reports
   only periodically, with each report representing a number of
   identical or near-identical incidents.  One might even do something
   inverse-exponentially, sending reports for each of the first ten
   incidents, then every tenth incident up to 100, then every 100th
   incident up to 1000, etc., until some period of relative quiet after
   which the limitation resets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of this technique for "near-identical" incidents in
   particular causes a degradation in reporting quality, however.  If,
   for example, a large number of pieces of spam arrive from one
   attacker, a reporting agent might decide only to send a report about
   a fraction of those messages.  While this averts a flood of reports
   to a system administrator, the precise details of each incident are
   similarly not sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.6"><h3>6.6   Redaction of Data in DKIM Reports</h3></a>

   This memo requires that the canonicalized header and body be returned
   without being subject to redaction when a DKIM failure is being
   reported.  This is necessary to ensure that the returned
   canonicalized forms are useful for debugging, as they must be
   compared to the equivalent form at the signer.  If a message is
   altered in transit, and the returned data are also redacted, the
   redacted portion and the altered portion may overlap, rendering the
   comparison results meaningless.  However, unredacted data can leak
   information the reporting entity considers to be private.  It is for
   this reason the return of the canonicalized forms is not required.
