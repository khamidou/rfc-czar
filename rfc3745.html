</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document serves to register and document the standard MIME types
   associated with the ISO/IEC 15444 standards, commonly known as JPEG
   2000 (Joint Photographic Experts Group).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes the registration of the MIME [MIME1] sub-
   types image/jp2, video/mj2, image/jpx, and image/jpm.  The image
   encoding is defined by [ISO-JPEG2000-1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The still image file format to which this document refers is defined
   in Annex I of [ISO-JPEG2000-1].  Note that a file format is optional
   in [ISO-JPEG2000-1], but mandatory for the MIME sub-type.  This
   document is not related to the definition of the MIME sub-type
   image/jpeg, which is partly defined by [ISO-JPEG-1], and partly by
   the file format specification defined in [JFIF].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   JPEG 2000 is a new standard, intended to create a image coding system
   for many types of still images (bi-level, gray-level, color, multi-
   component) with different characteristics (natural images,
   scientific, medical, remote sensing, imagery, text, rendered
   graphics, etc.) allowing different imaging models (client/server,
   real-time transmission, image library archival, limited buffer and
   bandwidth resources, etc.) within a unified system.  This coding
   system is intended to provide low bit-rate operation with rate-
   distortion and subjective image quality performance superior to
   existing standards, without sacrificing performance at other points
   in the rate-distortion spectrum.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This standard is intended to serve still image compression needs that
   are currently not served by the current JPEG standards [ISO-JPEG-1],
   [ISO-JPEG-2], [ISO-JPEG-3], and [ISO-JPEG-4], and is intended to
   compliment, not replace, the current JPEG standards.  JPEG 2000 is a
   modern wavelet-based codec that is expected to be widely used for
   still images.  Its use for motion sequences is expected to be similar
   to JPEG:  in those environments where only a single codec is
   required, and JPEG 2000 is available (e.g., digital still cameras
   recording short motion sequences) or where frame-by-frame coding is
   desired (no inter-frame coding).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is a standard file format for Motion JPEG 2000 sequences.  This
   file format permits the carriage of audio in addition to the video.
   The format is derived from the ISO Base Media File Format as defined
   in [ISO-JPEG2000-12].  The visual coder in a Motion JPEG 2000 file is
   JPEG 2000.  The Motion JPEG 2000 standard is specified in [ISO-
   JPEG2000-3].  The ISO Base Media File Format is jointly maintained by
   the ISO/IEC JPEG and MPEG committees.  The MP4 format is also derived
   from the ISO Base Media File Format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Therefore, to identify this restricted usage, a new mime type is
   desirable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This file type is intended always to contain a video sequence, though
   simple audio is permitted in addition to the video.  Therefore it
   falls correctly under the "video" branch of mime types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Also within WG1 of ISO there is an effort underway to define a
   standard file format for Compound Images.  This file format
   optionally supports other coding systems, in addition to JPEG 2000,
   as needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   JPEG 2000 Definition</h2></a>

   JPEG 2000 is defined in detail in [ISO-JPEG2000-1].  The
   documentation can be obtained from any national standards body or
   from ISO at http://www.iso.ch.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information as to its latest status, and downloads of the initial
   documents and some supporting documentation are available through the
   JPEG committee's official Web site at http://www.jpeg.org.
   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original JPEG 2000 specification [ISO-JPEG2000-1] to obtain complete
   feature and technical details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   JPEG 2000 Scope</h3></a>

   JPEG 2000 is used to compress image data that typically comes from
   digital cameras, scanners, frame grabbers, complex image capture
   devices such as medical or satellite systems, and paint- and photo-
   retouching programs.  Unlike previous JPEG standards, it includes
   information necessary to allow its use as a complete coding
   architecture.  [ISO-JPEG2000-1] defines a set of lossless (bit-
   preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding continuous-tone,
   bi-level, gray-scale, or colour digital still images.  It therefore:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  specifies decoding processes for converting compressed image data
      to reconstructed image data;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  specifies a codestream syntax containing information for
      interpreting the compressed image data;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  specifies a file format;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  provides guidance on encoding processes for converting source
      image data to compressed image data;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  provides guidance on how to implement these processes in practice.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [ISO-JPEG2000-1] is one of a series of standards which will cover the
   full range of facilities the new architecture is intended to offer.
   Approval has been given for JPEG to develop the following documents
   in addition to [ISO-JPEG2000-1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 2 - Coding extensions [ISO-JPEG2000-2].  This includes a more
      comprehensive file format and other extensions to the definitions
      in [ISO-JPEG2000-1].  The mime sub-type image/jpx is recommended
      to describe files based on this Part, and a separate RFC is
      planned to describe this usage and its associated file extensions
      of jpf and jpx.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 3 - Motion JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-3].  This provides
      definitions of how the standard may be extended for use in
      recording time series of JPEG 2000 images with associated metadata
      such as audio objects.  This document registers the mime sub-type
      video/mj2 for motion JPEG 2000, with associated file extensions
      mj2 and mjp2.
   -  Part 4 - Conformance [ISO-JPEG2000-4].  This deals with testing of
      equipment and systems claimed to conform to the JPEG 2000
      standards.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 5 - Reference software [ISO-JPEG2000-5].  This will provide
      developers with a source of publicly available reference software.
      Its role is envisaged as similar in concept to that played by the
      Independent JPEG Group (IJG) in publicizing the current [ISO-
      JPEG-1] standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 6 - Compound Image File Format [ISO-JPEG2000-6].  This
      describes a file format used to store compound documents using
      JPEG 2000 compression.  These may contain scanned images,
      synthetic images or both.  This work is based on the multi-layer
      Mixed Raster Content (MRC) imaging model, defined in ITU-T T.44 |
      ISO 16485.  The mime sub-type image/jpm is recommended to describe
      files based on this Part.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 7 - Has been withdrawn

   -  Part 8 - JPSEC (Security aspects) [ISO-JPEG2000-8].  This provides
      standardised tools and solutions in terms of specifications in
      order to ensure the security of transaction, protection of
      contents (IPR), and protection of technologies (IP), and to allow
      applications to generate, consume, and exchange JPEG 2000 Secured
      bitstreams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 9 - JPIP (Interactive protocols) [ISO-JPEG2000-9].  This
      client-server protocol has been designed to exploit JPEG 2000's
      flexibility with respect to random access, codestream reordering
      and incremental decoding in a networked environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 10 - JP3D (Volumetric imaging) [ISO-JPEG2000-10].  This will
      provide extensions of JPEG 2000 for logically rectangular 3-
      dimensional data sets with no time component.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 11 - JPWL (Wireless applications) [ISO-JPEG2000-11].  This
      extends the elements in [ISO-JPEG2000-1] with mechanisms for error
      protection and correction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Part 12 - ISO Base Media File Format [ISO-JPEG2000-12].  This is
      the part of the file format used by JPEG 2000 which is common with
      that used within MPEG-4 [ISO-MPEG4].
	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   JPEG 2000 Features</h3></a>

   Some of the features of JPEG 2000 include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  JPEG 2000 is capable of describing bi-level, grayscale, palette-
      color, and full-color image data in several color spaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  JPEG 2000 includes a number of compression schemes that allow
      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
      applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  JPEG 2000 is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as
      new needs arise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  JPEG 2000 allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private
      or special-purpose information within the metadata of its file
      format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  These are features that JPEG 2000 shares with the definition of
      TIFF [RFC-TIFF].  In addition, JPEG 2000 offers:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  state of the art lossless and lossy compression, based on wavelet
      technology, within a single codestream

   -  low bit-rate compression performance effective down to below 0.25
      bits per pixel for high resolution gray-scale images

   -  large image handling (greater than 64k x 64k pixels) without
      tiling

   -  single decompression architecture.  The current JPEG standard
      [ISO-JPEG-1] has 44 modes, many of which are application specific
      and not used by the majority of JPEG decoders.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  features to improve transmission in noisy environments, for
      example mobile radio / telephony

   -  capability to handle both natural and computer generated imagery

	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   JPEG 2000 utilizes a structure that can store image data, and
   metadata corresponding to this image data.  The fields defined in the
   JPEG 2000 standards are of a descriptive nature and provide
   information that may be useful to facilitate viewing, rendering and
   cataloging of images by a recipient.  As such, the fields currently
   defined in the JPEG 2000 standards do not in themselves create
   additional security risks, since the fields are not used to induce
   any particular behavior by the recipient application.  It should be
   noted that selected metadata fields may encompass information partly
   intended to protect the image against unauthorized use or
   distribution.  In this case the intention is that alteration or
   removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offense under
   national agreements based World Intellectual Property Organization
   (WIPO) treaties.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   JPEG 2000 has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
   possible that metadata fields could be defined in the future which
   could be used to induce particular actions on the part of the
   recipient, thus presenting additional security risks, but this type
   of capability is currently not supported in the referenced JPEG 2000
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Encryption, signing, or authentication of these file formats can use
   mechanisms defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-8].

                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                   stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable

                                   a result, implementations may decode

   The image/jpm content-type refers to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-1] encoded image
   data.  The file format is also defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-6].  The
   recommended file suffix is "jpm"

   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/jpm

MIME media type name:              image

                                   It is up to the implementation to
                                   determine the application (if
                                   necessary) and render the image to
                                   the user.
Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                   transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
