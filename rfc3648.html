</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This specification extends the Web Distributed Authoring and
   Versioning (WebDAV) Protocol to support the server-side ordering of
   collection members.  Of particular interest are orderings that are
   not based on property values, and so cannot be achieved using a
   search protocol's ordering option and cannot be maintained
   automatically by the server.  Protocol elements are defined to let
   clients specify the position in the ordering of each collection
   member, as well as the semantics governing the ordering.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Notational Conventions</h2></a>

   Since this document describes a set of extensions to the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol [RFC2518], which is itself an
   extension to the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the augmented BNF used here to
   describe protocol elements is exactly the same as described in
   Section 2.1 of HTTP [RFC2616].  Since this augmented BNF uses the
   basic production rules provided in Section 2.2 of HTTP, these rules
   apply to this document as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document uses XML DTD fragments as a purely notational
   convention.  WebDAV request and response bodies can not be validated
   due to the specific extensibility rules defined in section 23 of
   [RFC2518] and due to the fact that all XML elements defined by this
   specification use the XML namespace name "DAV:".  In particular:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. element names use the "DAV:" namespace,

   2. element ordering is irrelevant,

   3. extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child
      elements) may be added anywhere, except where explicitly stated
      otherwise,

   4. extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for
      this element) may be added anywhere, except where explicitly
      stated otherwise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This specification builds on the collection infrastructure provided
   by the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol, adding support for the
   server-side ordering of collection members.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are many scenarios in which it is useful to impose an ordering
   on a collection at the server, such as expressing a recommended
   access order, or a revision history order.  The members of a
   collection might represent the pages of a book, which need to be
   presented in order if they are to make sense, or an instructor might
   create a collection of course readings that she wants to be displayed
   in the order they are to be read.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Orderings may be based on property values, but this is not always the
   case.  The resources in the collection may not have properties that
   can be used to support the desired ordering.  Orderings based on
   properties can be obtained using a search protocol's ordering option,
   but orderings not based on properties cannot.  These orderings
   generally need to be maintained by a human user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ordering protocol defined here focuses on support for such
   human-maintained orderings.  Its protocol elements allow clients to
   specify the position of each collection member in the collection's
   ordering, as well as the semantics governing the order.  The protocol
   is designed to allow additional support in the future for orderings
   that are maintained automatically by the server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The remainder of this document is structured as follows: Section 3
   defines terminology that will be used throughout the specification.
   Section 4 provides an overview of ordered collections.  Section 5
   describes how to create an ordered collection, and Section 6
   discusses how to set a member's position in the ordering of a
   collection.  Section 7 explains how to change a collection ordering.
   Section 8 discusses listing the members of an ordered collection.
   Section 9 discusses the impact on version-controlled collections (as
   defined in [RFC3253]).  Section 10 describes capability discovery.
   Sections 11 through 13 discuss security, internationalization, and
   IANA considerations.  The remaining sections provide supporting
   information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The terminology used here follows that in [RFC2518] and [RFC3253].
   Definitions of the terms resource, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),
   and Uniform Resource Locator (URL) are provided in [RFC2396].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ordered Collection

      A collection for which the results from a PROPFIND request are
      guaranteed to be in the order specified for that collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Unordered Collection

      A collection for which the client cannot depend on the
      repeatability of the ordering of results from a PROPFIND request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Client-Maintained Ordering

      An ordering of collection members that is maintained on the server
      based on client requests specifying the position of each
      collection member in the ordering.
   Server-Maintained Ordering

      An ordering of collection members that is maintained automatically
      by the server, based on a client's choice of ordering semantics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ordering Semantics

      In general, ordering semantics are the set of structures or
      meanings applied to the ordering of the member of a specific
      collection.  Within this document, "ordering semantics" refers
      specifically to the structure specified in the DAV:ordering-type
      property.  See Section 4.1.1 for more information on
      DAV:ordering-type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document uses the terms "precondition", "postcondition" and
   "protected property" as defined in [RFC3253].  Servers MUST report
   pre-/postcondition failures as described in section 1.6 of this
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Overview of Ordered Collections</h2></a>

   If a collection is not ordered, the client cannot depend on the
   repeatability of the ordering of results from a PROPFIND request.  By
   specifying an ordering for a collection, a client requires the server
   to follow that ordering whenever it responds to a PROPFIND request on
   that collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Server-side orderings may be client-maintained or server-maintained.
   For client-maintained orderings, a client must specify the ordering
   position of each of the collection's members, either when the member
   is added to the collection (using the Position header (Section 6)) or
   later (using the ORDERPATCH (Section 7) method).  For server-
   maintained orderings, the server automatically positions each of the
   collection's members according to the ordering semantics.  This
   specification supports only client-maintained orderings, but is
   designed to allow the future extension with server-maintained
   orderings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A collection that supports ordering is not required to be ordered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a collection is ordered, each of its internal member URIs MUST
   appear in the ordering exactly once, and the ordering MUST NOT
   include any URIs that are not internal members of the collection.
   The server is responsible for enforcing these constraints on
   orderings.  The server MUST remove an internal member URI from the
   ordering when it is removed from the collection.  Removing an
   internal member MUST NOT affect the ordering of the remaining
   internal members.  The server MUST add an internal member URI to the
   ordering when it is added to the collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Only one ordering can be attached to any collection.  Multiple
   orderings of the same resources can be achieved by creating multiple
   collections referencing those resources, and attaching a different
   ordering to each collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An ordering is considered to be part of the state of a collection
   resource.  Consequently, the ordering is the same no matter which URI
   is used to access the collection and is protected by locks or access
   control constraints on the collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Additional Collection properties</h3></a>

   A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the
   properties defined in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.1"><h4>4.1.1   DAV:ordering-type (protected)</h4></a>

   The DAV:ordering-type property indicates whether the collection is
   ordered and, if so, uniquely identifies the semantics of the
   ordering.  It may also point to an explanation of the semantics in
   human and/or machine-readable form.  At a minimum, this allows human
   users who add members to the collection to understand where to
   position them in the ordering.  This property cannot be set using
   PROPPATCH.  Its value can only be set by including the Ordering-Type
   header with a MKCOL request or by submitting an ORDERPATCH request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ordering types are identified by URIs that uniquely identify the
   semantics of the collection's ordering.  The following two URIs are
   predefined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DAV:custom: The value DAV:custom indicates that the collection is
      ordered, but the semantics governing the ordering are not being
      advertised.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DAV:unordered: The value DAV:unordered indicates that the collection
      is not ordered.  That is, the client cannot depend on the
      repeatability of the ordering of results from a PROPFIND request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An ordering-aware client interacting with an ordering-unaware server
   (e.g., one that is implemented only according to [RFC2518]) SHOULD
   assume that the collection is unordered if a collection does not have
   the DAV:ordering-type property.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   <!ELEMENT ordering-type (href) >
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Creating an Ordered Collection</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Overview</h3></a>

   When a collection is created, the client MAY request that it be
   ordered and specify the semantics of the ordering by using the new
   Ordering-Type header (defined below) with a MKCOL request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For collections that are ordered, the client SHOULD identify the
   semantics of the ordering with a URI in the Ordering-Type header,
   although the client MAY simply set the header value to DAV:custom to
   indicate that the collection is ordered but the semantics of the
   ordering are not being advertised.  Setting the value to a URI that
   identifies the ordering semantics provides the information a human
   user or software package needs to insert new collection members into
   the ordering intelligently.  Although the URI in the Ordering-Type
   header MAY point to a resource that contains a definition of the
   semantics of the ordering, clients SHOULD NOT access that resource to
   avoid overburdening its server.  A value of DAV:unordered in the
   Ordering-Type header indicates that the client wants the collection
   to be unordered.  If the Ordering-Type header is not present, the
   collection will be unordered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional Marshalling:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Ordering-Type = "Ordering-Type" ":" absoluteURI
      ; absoluteURI: see RFC2396, section 3

      The URI "DAV:unordered" indicates that the collection is not
      ordered, while "DAV:custom" indicates that the collection is to be
      ordered, but the semantics of the ordering is not being
      advertised.  Any other URI value indicates that the collection is
      ordered, and identifies the semantics of the ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional Preconditions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (DAV:ordered-collections-supported): the server MUST support
      ordered collections in the part of the URL namespace identified by
      the request URL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional Postconditions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (DAV:ordering-type-set): if the Ordering-Type header was present,
      the request MUST have created a new collection resource with the
      DAV:ordering-type being set according to the Ordering-Type request
      header.  The collection MUST be ordered unless the ordering type
      is "DAV:unordered".
	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Example: Creating an Ordered Collection</h3></a>

   >> Request:

    >> Response:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HTTP/1.1 201 Created

   In this example, a new ordered collection was created.  Its
   DAV:ordering-type property has the URI from the Ordering-Type header
   as its value http://example.org/orderings/compass.html.  In this
   case, the URI identifies the semantics governing a client-maintained
   ordering.  As new members are added to the collection, clients or end
   users can use the semantics to determine where to position the new
   members in the ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Setting the Position of a Collection Member</h2></a>

	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Overview</h3></a>

   When a new member is added to a collection with a client-maintained
   ordering (for example, with PUT, COPY, or MKCOL), its position in the
   ordering can be set with the new Position header.  The Position
   header allows the client to specify that an internal member URI
   should be first in the collection's ordering, last in the
   collection's ordering, immediately before some other internal member
   URI in the collection's ordering, or immediately after some other
   internal member URI in the collection's ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the Position request header is not used when adding a member to an
   ordered collection, then:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the request is replacing an existing resource, the server MUST
      preserve the present ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the request is adding a new internal member URI to the
      collection, the server MUST append the new member to the end of
      the ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note to implementers: this specification does not mandate a specific
   implementation of MOVE operations within the same parent collection.
   Therefore, servers may either implement this as a simple rename
   operation (preserving the collection member's position), or as a
   sequence of "remove" and "add" (causing the semantics of "adding a
   new member" to apply).  Future revisions of this specification may
   specify this behaviour more precisely based on future implementation
   experience.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Additional Marshalling:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Position = "Position" ":" ("first" | "last" |
                                (("before" | "after") segment))

      segment is defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC2396].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The segment is interpreted relative to the collection to which the
      new member is being added.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When the Position header is present, the server MUST insert the
      new member into the ordering at the specified location.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The "first" keyword indicates that the new member is placed in the
      beginning position in the collection's ordering, while "last"
      indicates that the new member is placed in the final position in
      the collection's ordering.  The "before" keyword indicates that
      the new member is added to the collection's ordering immediately
      prior to the position of the member identified in the segment.
      Likewise, the "after" keyword indicates that the new member is
      added to the collection's ordering immediately following the
      position of the member identified in the segment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the request is replacing an existing resource and the Position

   A PROPFIND request is used to retrieve a listing of the members of an
   ordered collection, just as it is used to retrieve a listing of the
   members of an unordered collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, when responding to a PROPFIND on an ordered collection, the
   server MUST order the response elements according to the ordering
   defined on the collection.  If a collection is unordered, the client
   cannot depend on the repeatability of the ordering of results from a
   PROPFIND request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In a response to a PROPFIND with Depth: infinity, members of
   different collections may be interleaved.  That is, the server is not
   required to do a breadth-first traversal.  The only requirement is
   that the members of any ordered collection appear in the order
   defined for that collection.  Thus, for the hierarchy illustrated in
   the following figure, where collection A is an ordered collection
   with the ordering B C D,

                          A
                         /|\

                      /  /|\
                     E  F G H

   it would be acceptable for the server to return response elements in
   the order A B E C F G H D or "A B E C H G F D" as well (if C is
   unordered).  In this response, B, C, and D appear in the correct
   order, separated by members of other collections.  Clients can use a
   series of Depth: 1 PROPFIND requests to avoid the complexity of
   processing Depth: infinity responses based on depth-first traversals.

   This section is provided to make WebDAV implementers aware of the
   security implications of this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All of the security considerations of HTTP/1.1 and the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol specification also apply to this
   protocol specification.  In addition, ordered collections introduce a
   new security concern.  This issue is detailed here.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.1"><h3>11.1   Denial of Service and DAV:ordering-type</h3></a>

   There may be some risk of denial of service at sites that are
   advertised in the DAV:ordering-type property of collections.
   However, it is anticipated that widely-deployed applications will use
   hard-coded values for frequently-used ordering semantics rather than
   looking up the semantics at the location specified by DAV:ordering-
   type.  This risk will be further reduced if clients observe the
   recommendation of Section 5.1 that requests not be sent to the URI in
   DAV:ordering-type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12"><h2>12.   Internationalization Considerations</h2></a>

   This specification follows the practices of [RFC2518] by encoding all
   human-readable content using [XML] and in the treatment of names.
   Consequently, this specification complies with the IETF Character Set
   Policy [RFC2277].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   WebDAV applications MUST support the character set tagging, character
   set encoding, and the language tagging functionality of the XML
   specification.  This constraint ensures that the human-readable
   content of this specification complies with [RFC2277].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As in [RFC2518], names in this specification fall into three
   categories: names of protocol elements such as methods and headers,
   names of XML elements, and names of properties.  The naming of
   protocol elements follows the precedent of HTTP using English names
   encoded in USASCII for methods and headers.  The names of XML
   elements used in this specification are English names encoded in
   UTF-8.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For error reporting, [RFC2518] follows the convention of HTTP/1.1
   status codes, including with each status code a short, English
   description of the code (e.g., 423 Locked).  Internationalized
   applications will ignore this message, and display an appropriate
   message in the user's language and character set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification introduces no new strings that are displayed to
   users as part of normal, error-free operation of the protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the rationale of these decisions and advice for application
   implementers, see [RFC2518].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-13"><h2>13.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This document uses the namespaces defined by [RFC2518] for properties
   and XML elements.  All other IANA considerations mentioned in
   [RFC2518] also apply to this document.
	<a name="section-14"><h2>14.   Intellectual Property Statement</h2></a>

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
