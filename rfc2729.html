</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   The intention of this memo is to define a classification system for
   the communication requirements of any large-scale multicast
   application (LSMA). It is very unlikely one protocol can achieve a
   compromise between the diverse requirements of all the parties
   involved in any LSMA. It is therefore necessary to understand the
   worst-case scenarios in order to minimize the range of protocols
   needed. Dynamic protocol adaptation is likely to be necessary which
   will require logic to map particular combinations of requirements to
   particular mechanisms.  Standardizing the way that applications
   define their requirements is a necessary step towards this.
   Classification is a first step towards standardization.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   This taxonomy consists of a large number of parameters that are
   considered useful for describing the communication requirements of
   LSMAs. To describe a particular application, each parameter would be
   assigned a value. Typical ranges of values are given wherever
   possible.  Failing this, the type of any possible values is given.
   The parameters are collected into ten or so higher level categories,
   but this is purely for convenience.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The parameters are pitched at a level considered meaningful to
   application programmers. However, they describe communications not
   applications - the terms '3D virtual world', or 'shared TV' might
   imply communications requirements, but they don't accurately describe
   them.  Assumptions about the likely mechanism to achieve each
   requirement are avoided where possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While the parameters describe communications, it will be noticed that
   few requirements concerning routing etc. are apparent. This is
   because applications have few direct requirements on these second
   order aspects of communications. Requirements in these areas will
   have to be inferred from application requirements (e.g. latency).
   The taxonomy is likely to be useful in a number of ways:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. Most simply, it can be used as a checklist to create a
      requirements statement for a particular LSMA. Example applications
      will be classified [bagnall98] using the taxonomy in order to
      exercise (and improve) it

   2. Because strictest requirement have been defined for many
      parameters, it will be possible to identify worst case scenarios
      for the design of protocols

   3. Because the scope of each parameter has been defined (per session,
      per receiver etc.), it will be possible to highlight where
      heterogeneity is going to be most marked

   4. It is a step towards standardization of the way LSMAs define their
      communications requirements. This could lead to standard APIs
      between applications and protocol adaptation middleware

   5. Identification of limitations in current Internet technology for
      LSMAs to be added to the LSMA limitations memo [limitations]

   6. Identification of gaps in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      working group coverage

   This approach is intended to complement that used where application
   scenarios for Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) are proposed
   in order to generate network design metrics (values of communications
   parameters). Instead of creating the communications parameters from
   the applications, we try to imagine applications that might be
   enabled by stretching communications parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Definition of Sessions</h2></a>

   The following terms have no agreed definition, so they will be
   defined for this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Session
      a happening or gathering consisting of flows of information
      related by a common description that persists for a non-trivial
      time (more than a few seconds) such that the participants (be they
      humans or applications) are involved and interested at
      intermediate times.  A session may be defined recursively as a
      super-set of other sessions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Secure session
      a session with restricted access
   A session or secure session may be a sub and/or super set of a
   multicast group. A session can simultaneously be both a sub and a
   super-set of a multicast group by spanning a number of groups while
   time-sharing each group with other sessions.

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Summary of Communications Parameters</h3></a>

   Before the communications parameters are defined, typed and given
   worst-case values, they are simply listed for convenience. Also for

   The terms used in the above table are now defined for the context of
   this document. Under each definition, the type of their value is
   given and where possible worst-case values and example applications
   that would exhibit this requirement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no mention of whether a communication is a stream or a
   discrete interaction. An attempt to use this distinction as a way of
   characterizing communications proved to be remarkably unhelpful and
   was dropped.
	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1  Types</h4></a>

   Each requirement has a type. The following is a list of all the types
   used in the following definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Application Benchmark

      This is some measure of the processor load of an application, in
      some architecture neutral unit. This is non-trivial since the
      processing an application requires may change radically with
      different hardware, for example, a video client with and without
      hardware support.

   Abstract Currency
      An abstract currency is one which is adjusted to take inflation
      into account. The simplest way of doing this is to use the value
      of a real currency on a specific date. It is effectively a way of
      assessing the cost of something in "real terms". An example might
      be 1970 US$. Another measure might be "average man hours".

   Transactional

      When multiple operations must occur atomically, transactional
      communications guarantee that either all occur or none occur and a
      failure is flagged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  Boolean
      Meaning:               Transactional or Not transaction
      Strictest Requirement: Transactional
      Scope:                 per stream
      Example Application:   Bank credit transfer, debit and credit must
                             be atomic.
      NB:                    Transactions are potentially much more
                             complex, but it is believed this is
                             an application layer problem.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Guaranteed

      Guarantees communications will succeed under certain conditions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  Enumerated
      Meaning:               Deferrable - if communication fails it will
                             be deferred until a time when it will be
                             successful.
                             Guaranteed - the communication will succeed
                             so long as all necessary components are
                             working.
                             No guarantee - failure will not be
                             reported.
      Strictest Requirement: Deferrable
      Example Application:   Stock quote feed - Guaranteed
      Scope:                 per stream
      NB:                    The application will need to set parameters
                             to more fully define Guarantees, which the
                             middleware may translate into, for example,
                             queue lengths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Tolerated loss

      This specifies the proportion of data from a communication that
      can be lost before the application becomes completely unusable.
      Type:                  Fraction
      Meaning:               fraction of the stream that can be lost
      Strictest Requirement: 0%
      Scope:                 per stream
      Example Application:   Video - 20%

   Semantic loss

      The application specifies how many and which parts of the
      communication can be discarded if necessary.

   Setup Fail-over time

      The time before a failure is detected and a replacement component
      is invoked. From the applications point of view this is the time
      it may take in exceptional circumstances for a channel to be set-
      up. It is not the "normal" operating delay before a channel is
      created.

   Hard real- time

      There is a meta-requirement on timeliness. If hard real-time is
      required then the interpretation of all the other requirements
      changes.  Failures to achieve the required timeliness must be
      reported before the communication is made. By contrast soft real-
      time means that there is no guarantee that an event will occur in
      time. However statistical measures can be used to indicate the
      probability of completion in the required time, and policies such
      as making sure the probability is 95% or better could be used.

                                 case
                             anonymously identified  - (messages from
                                 the same sender can be linked)
                             unadvertised (but traceable) - meaning that
                                 traffic can be detected and traced to
                                 it's source or destination, this is a
                                 breach if the very fact that two
                                 specific principals are communicating
                                 is sensitive.
                             undetectable
      Strictest Requirement: All levels budget of attacker

                             undetectable - zero

   Confidentiality

      Confidentiality defines how well protected the content of a
      communication is from snooping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  Abstract Currency
      Meaning:               Level of Confidentiality, the cost of
                             gaining illicit access to the content of a
                             stream
      Strictest Requirement:  budget of attacker
      Scope:                 per stream
      Example Application:   Secure email -  value of transmitted
                             information

   Retransmit prevention strength

      This is extremely hard at the moment. This is not to say it's not
      a requirement.
      Type:                  Abstract Currency
      Meaning:               The cost of retransmitting a secure piece
                             of information should exceed the specified
                             amount.
      Strictest Requirement: Cost of retransmitting  value of
                             information
      Scope:                 per stream

   Membership Criteria

      If a principal attempts to participate in a communication then a
      check will be made to see if it is allowed to do so. The
      requirement is that certain principals will be allowed, and others
      excluded. Given the application is being protected from network
      details there are only two types of specification available, per
      user, and per organization (where an organization may contain
      other organizations, and each user may be a member of multiple
      organizations). Rules could however be built on properties of a
      user, for example does the user own a key? Host properties could
      also be used, so users on slow hosts or hosts running the wrong OS
      could be excluded.

   Collusion prevention

      Which aspects of collusion it is required to prevent. Collusion is
      defined as malicious co-operation between members of a secure
      session.  Superficially, it would appear that collusion is not a
      relevant threat in a multicast, because everyone has the same
      information, however, wherever there is differentiation, it can be
      exploited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  {

                             one) - cost of colluding
      Strictest Requirement: For all threats cost attackers
                             combined resources
      Scope:                 per stream
      Example Application:   A race where delay of the start signal may
                             be allowed for, but one participant may
                             fake packet delay while receiving the start
                             signal from another participant.
      NB:                    Time race collusion is the most difficult
                             one to prevent. Also note that while these
                             may be requirements for some systems this
                             does not mean there are necessarily
                             solutions. Setting tough requirements may
                             result in the middleware being unable to
                             create a valid channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Fairness

      Fairness is a meta-requirement of many other requirements. Of
      particular interest are Reliability and Timeliness requirements.
      When a communication is first created the creator may wish to
      specify a set of requirements for these parameters. Principals
      which join later may wish to set tighter limits. Fairness enforces
      a policy that any improvement is requirement by one principal must
      be matched by all others, in effect requirements can only be set
      for the whole group. This increases the likelihood that
      requirements of this kind will fail to be met. If fairness if not
      an issue then some parts of the network can use more friendly
      methods to achieve those simpler requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  Level of variance of the requirement that
                             needs to be fair. For example, if the
                             latency requirement states within 2
                             seconds, the level of fairness required may
                             be that variations in latency are not more
                             than 0.1s. This has in fact become an issue
                             in online gaming (e.g. Quake)
      Meaning:               The variance of performance with respect to
                             any other requirement is less than the
                             specified amount.
      Scope:                 per stream, per requirement
      Example Application:   Networked game, latency to receive
                             positions of players must be within 5ms for
                             all players.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Action on compromise

      The action to take on detection of compromise (until security
      reassured).

      Strictest Requirement: pause
      Example Application:   Secure video conference - if intruder
                             alert, everyone is warned, but they can
                             continue while knowing not to discuss
                             sensitive matters (cf. catering staff
                             during a meeting).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-3.2.8.1"><h4>3.2.8.1  Security Dynamics</h4></a>

      Security dynamics are the temporal properties of the security
      mechanisms that are deployed. They may affect other requirements
      such as latency or simply be a reflection of the security
      limitations of the system. The requirements are often concerned
      with abnormal circumstances (e.g. system violation).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Mean time between compromises

      This is not the same as the strength of a system. A fairly weak
      system may have a very long time between compromises because it is
      not worth breaking in to, or it is only worth it for very few
      people. Mean time between compromises is a combination of
      strength, incentive and scale.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  Time
      Scope:                 Per stream
      Strictest Requirement: indefinite
      Example Application:   Secure Shell - 1500hrs

   Compromise detection time limit

      The average time it must take to detect a compromise (one
      predicted in the design of the detection system, that is).
      Type:                  Time
      Scope:                 Per stream
      Strictest Requirement: Round trip time
      Example Application:   Secure Shell - 2secs

   Compromise recovery time limit

      The maximum time it must take to re-seal the security after a
      breach.  This combined with the compromise detection time limit
      defines how long the system must remain inactive to avoid more
      security breaches. For example if a compromise is detected in one
      minute, and recovery takes five, then one minute of traffic is now
      insecure and the members of the communication must remain silent
      for four minutes after detection while security is re-established.

      Example Application:   Audio conference - 10 seconds

	<a name="section-3.2.9"><h4>3.2.9  Payment & Charging</h4></a>

   Total Cost

      The total cost of communication must be limited to this amount.
      This would be useful for transfer as opposed to stream type
      applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type:                  Currency
      Meaning:               Maximum charge allowed

      Strictest Requirement: Free
      Example Application:   File Transfer: comms cost must be < 1p/Mb

   Cost per Time

                             This is the cost per unit time. Some
                             applications may not be able to predict the
                             duration of a communication. It may be more
                             meaningful for those to be able to specify
                             price per time instead.
      Type:                  Currency per timeS

      Scope:                 Per user per stream
      Strictest Requirement: Free
      Example Application:   Video Conference - 15p / minute
   Cost per Mb

      This is the cost per unit of data. Some communications may be
      charged by the amount of data transferred. Some applications may
      prefer to specify requirements in this way.
