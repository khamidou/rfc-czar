	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Numerous use cases exist for expressing the management information
   described by SMI Management Information Base (MIB) modules in XML
   [XML].  Potential use cases reside both outside and within the
   traditional IETF network management community.  For example,
   developers of some XML-based management applications may want to
   incorporate the rich set of data models provided by MIB modules.
   Developers of other XML-based management applications may want to
   access MIB module instrumentation via gateways to SNMP agents.  Such
   applications benefit from the IETF standard mapping of SMI datatypes
   to XML datatypes via XSD [XMLSchema], [XSDDatatypes].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MIB modules use SMIv2 [RFC2578] to describe data models.  For legacy
   MIB modules, SMIv1 [RFC1155] was used.  MIB data conveyed in variable
   bindings ("varbinds") within protocol data units (PDUs) of SNMP
   messages use the primitive, base datatypes defined by the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SMI allows for the creation of derivative datatypes, "textual
   conventions" ("TCs") [RFC2579].  A TC has a unique name, has a syntax
   that either refines or is a base SMI datatype, and has relatively
   precise application-level semantics.  TCs facilitate correct
   application-level handling of MIB data, improve readability of MIB
   modules by humans, and support appropriate renderings of MIB data.
   Values in varbinds corresponding to MIB objects defined with TC
   syntax are always encoded as the base SMI datatype underlying the TC
   syntax.  Thus, the XSD mappings defined in this memo provide support
   for values of MIB objects defined with TC syntax as well as for
   values of MIB objects defined with base SMI syntax.  Using the
   translation of TC into base SMI datatypes any MIB module that uses
   TCs can be mapped into XSD using the mappings defined in this memo.
   For example, for IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), MIB objects
   defined using the InetAddress TC (as per [RFC4001]) are encoded using
   the base SMI datatype underlying the InetAddress TC syntax rather
   than the IpAddress base datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Various independent schemes have been devised for expressing SMI
   datatypes in XSD.  These schemes exhibit a degree of commonality,
   especially concerning numeric SMI datatypes, but these schemes also
   exhibit sufficient differences, especially concerning the non-numeric
   SMI datatypes, precluding uniformity of expression and general
   interoperability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Throughout this memo, the term "fidelity" refers to the quality of an
   accurate, consistent representation of SMI data values and the term
   "faithful" refers to the quality of reliably reflecting the semantics
   of SMI data values.  Thus defined, the characteristics of fidelity
   and being faithful are essential to uniformity of expression and
   general interoperability in the XML representation of SMI data
   values.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The primary purpose of this memo is to define the standard expression
   of SMI base datatypes in XML documents that is both uniform and
   interoperable.  This standard expression enables Internet operators,
   management application developers, and users to benefit from a wider
   range of management tools and to benefit from a greater degree of
   unified management.  Thus, standard expression enables and
   facilitates improvements to the timeliness, accuracy, and utility of
   management information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The overall objective of this memo, and of any related future memos
   as may be published, is to define the XSD equivalent [XSDDatatypes]
   of SMIv2 (STD 58) and to encourage XML-based protocols to carry, and
   XML-based applications to use, the management information defined in
   SMIv2-compliant MIB modules.  The use of a standard mapping from
   SMIv2 to XML via XSD validation enables and promotes the efficient
   reuse of existing and future MIB modules and instrumentation by XML-
   based protocols and management applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Developers of certain XML-based management applications will find
   this specification sufficient for their purposes.  Developers of
   other XML-based management applications may need to make more
   complete reuse of existing MIB modules, requiring standard XSD
   documents for TCs [RFC2579] and MIB structure [RFC2578].  Memos
   supporting such requirements are planned, but have not been produced
   at the time of this writing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, it is worthwhile to note that the goal of fidelity to the
   SMIv2 standard (STD 58), as specified in the "Requirements" section
   below, is crucial to this effort.  Fidelity leverages the established
   "rough consensus" of the precise SMIv2 data models contained in MIB
   modules, and leverages existing instrumentation, the "running code"
   implementing SMIv2 data models.  This effort does not include any
   redesign of SMIv2 datatypes, data structures or textual conventions
   in order to overcome known limitations.  Such work can be pursued by
   other efforts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Requirements</h2></a>

   The following set of requirements is intended to produce XML
   documents that can be validated via the XSD defined in this
   specification to faithfully represent values carried "on-the-wire" in
   SNMP PDUs as defined by the SMI:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R1.  All SMI base datatypes MUST have a corresponding XSD datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R2.  SMIv2 is the normative SMI for this document.  Prior to mapping
        datatypes into XSD, legacy SMIv1 modules MUST be converted (at
        least logically) in accordance with Section 2.1, inclusive, of
        the "Coexistence" RFC [RFC3584].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R3.  The XSD datatype specified for a given SMI datatype MUST be able
        to represent all valid values for that SMI datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R4.  The XSD datatype specified for a given SMI datatype MUST
        represent any special encoding rules associated with that SMI
        datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R5.  The XSD datatype specified for a given SMI datatype MUST include
        any restrictions on values associated with the SMI datatype.
   R6.  The XSD datatype specified for a given SMI datatype MUST be the
        most logical XSD datatype, with the fewest necessary
        restrictions on its set of values, consistent with the foregoing
        requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   R7.  The XML output produced as a result of meeting the foregoing
        requirements SHOULD be the most coherent and succinct
        representation (i.e., avoiding superfluous "decoration") from
        the perspective of readability by humans.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   XSD for SMI Base Datatypes</h2></a>

   This document provides XSD datatype mappings for the SMIv2 base
   datatypes only -- i.e., the eleven "ObjectSyntax" datatypes defined
   in RFC 2578.  These datatypes -- via tag values defined in the SMIv2
   to identify them in varbinds -- constrain values carried "on-the-
   wire" in SNMP PDUs between SNMP management applications and SNMP
   agents:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  INTEGER, Integer32

   o  Unsigned32, Gauge32

   o  Counter32

   o  TimeTicks

   o  Counter64

   o  OCTET STRING

   o  Opaque

   o  IpAddress

   o  OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   The "BITS" pseudo-type (also referred to as a "construct" in RFC
   2578) is treated as a Textual Convention, not a base datatype, for
   the purpose of this document.

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Rationale</h2></a>

   The XSD datatypes, including any specified restrictions, were chosen
   based on fit with the requirements specified earlier in this
   document, and with attention to simplicity while maintaining fidelity
   to the SMI.  Also, the "canonical representations" (i.e., refinements
   of the "lexical representations") documented in the W3C XSD
   specification [XMLSchema], [XSDDatatypes] are assumed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Numeric Datatypes</h3></a>

   All of the numeric XSD datatypes specified in the previous section --
   INTEGER, Integer32, Unsigned32, Gauge32, Counter32, TimeTicks, and
   Counter64 -- comply with the relevant requirements

   o  They cover all valid values for the corresponding SMI datatypes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  They comply with the standard encoding rules associated with the
      corresponding SMI datatypes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  They inherently match the range restrictions associated with the
      corresponding SMI datatypes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  They are the most direct XSD datatypes that exhibit the foregoing
      characteristics relative to the corresponding SMI datatypes (which
      is why no "restriction" statements -- other than the "base" XSD
      type -- are required in the XSD).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The XML output produced from the canonical representation of these
      XSD datatypes is also the most direct from the perspective of
      readability by humans (i.e., no leading "+" sign and no leading
      zeros).
   Special note to application developers: compliance with this schema
   in an otherwise correct translation from raw ("on-the-wire"
   representation) SNMP MIB data produces values that are faithful to
   the original.  However, the Gauge32, Counter32, Counter64, and
   TimeTicks datatypes have special application semantics that must be
   considered when using their raw values for anything other than
   display, printing, storage, or transmission of the literal value.
   RFC 2578 provides the necessary details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   OctetString</h3></a>

   This XSD datatype corresponds to the SMI "OCTET STRING" datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Several independent schemes for mapping SMI datatypes to XSD have
   used the XSD "string" type to represent "OCTET STRING", but this
   mapping does not conform to the requirements specified in this
   document.  Most notably, "string" cannot faithfully represent all
   valid values (0 thru 255) that each octet in an "OCTET STRING" can
   have -- or at least cannot do so in a way that provides for easy
   human readability of the resulting XML output.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Consequently, the XSD datatype "hexBinary" is specified as the
   standard mapping of the SMI "OCTET STRING" datatype.  In hexBinary,
   each octet is encoded as two hexadecimal digits; the canonical
   representation limits the set of allowed hexadecimal digits to 0-9
   and uppercase A-F.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The hexBinary representation of "OCTET STRING" complies with the
   relevant requirements:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It covers all valid values for the corresponding SMI datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It complies with the standard encoding rules associated with the
      corresponding SMI datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  With the "maxLength" restriction to 65535 octets, the XSD datatype
      specification matches the restrictions associated with the
      corresponding SMI datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It is the most direct XSD datatype that exhibits the foregoing
      characteristics relative to the corresponding SMI datatype (which
      must allow for any valid binary octet value).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The XML output produced from the canonical representation of this
      XSD datatype is not optimal with respect to readability by humans;
      however, that is a consequence of the SMI datatype itself.  Where
      human readability is more of a concern, it is likely that the
      actual MIB objects in question will be represented by textual
      conventions that limit the set of values that will be included in
      the OctetStrings and will, thus, bypass the hexBinary typing.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Opaque</h3></a>

   The "hexBinary" XSD datatype is specified as the representation of
   the SMI "Opaque" datatype generally for the same reasons as
   "hexBinary" is specified for the "OctetString" datatype:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It covers all valid values for the corresponding SMI datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It complies with the standard encoding rules associated with the
      corresponding SMI datatype.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  There are no restriction issues associated with using "hexBinary"
      for "Opaque".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  It is the most direct XSD datatype that exhibits the foregoing
      characteristics relative to the corresponding SMI datatype (which
      must allow for any valid binary octet value).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The XML output produced from the canonical representation of this
      XSD datatype is not optimal with respect to readability by humans;
      however, that is a consequence of the SMI datatype itself.
      Unmediated "Opaque" data is intended for consumption by
      applications, not humans.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   IpAddress</h3></a>

   The XSD "string" datatype is the natural choice to represent an
   IpAddress as XML output.  The "pattern" restriction applied in this
   case results in a dotted-decimal string of four values between "0"
   and "255" separated by a period (".") character.  This pattern also
   precludes leading zeros.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the SMI relies upon Textual Conventions (TCs) to specify an
   IPv6 address.  As such, the representation of an IPv6 address as an
   XSD datatype is beyond the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   ObjectIdentifier</h3></a>

   This XSD datatype corresponds to the SMI "OBJECT IDENTIFIER"
   datatype.
   The XSD "string" datatype is also the natural choice to represent an
   ObjectIdentifier as XML output, for the same reasons as for the
   IpAddress choice.  The "pattern" restriction applied in this case
   results in a dotted-decimal string of up to 128 elements (referred to
   as "sub-ids"), each holding an "Unsigned32" integer value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that the first two components of an "OBJECT IDENTIFIER" each
   have a limited range of values as indicated in the XSD pattern
   restriction and as described in the ASN1.1/BER standard [ASN.1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are three values allocated for the root node, and at most 39
   values for nodes subordinate to a root node value of 0 or 1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The minimum length of an "OBJECT IDENTIFIER" is two sub-ids and the
   representation of a zero-valued "OBJECT IDENTIFIER" is "0.0".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that no explicit "minLength" restriction, which would be "3" to
   allow for the minimum of two sub-ids and a single separating dot, is
   required since the pattern itself enforces this restriction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security considerations for any given SMI MIB module will be relevant
   to any XSD/XML mapping of that MIB module; however, the mapping
   defined in this document does not itself introduce any new security
   considerations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If and when proxies or gateways are developed to convey SNMP
   management information from SNMP agents to XML-based management
   applications via XSD/XML mapping of MIB modules based on this
   specification and its planned siblings, special care will need to be
   taken to ensure that all applicable SNMP security mechanisms are
   supported in an appropriate manner yet to be determined.
