                            NETWORK CHECKOUT


      As of August 21 we had performed the following verifications
with the sites listed below.  These verifications were done on an
arranged basis and do not indicate any degree of continuous
availability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In the category "NCP-107" the heading is somewhat misleading.
It does not indicate a thorough checkout of all the NCP functions
described in Document 1 and RFC-107.  It only indicates that the NCP
in question functioned to the extent required to respond to a RESET (a
necessary condition for the Rand NCP to consider the remote host "up")
and that the NCP performed the functions necessary for an ICP.  Thus,
this column really indicates only a small degree of NCP completeness.
Such function as ECHO, Give Back, error message generation and so on
were not checked.  We have checked some of these functions with UCSB
and SDC but not exhaustively.  This is mainly due to the tedium of
such a process.  BBN is currently writing a protocol certifier for
their DDP-516 host that will do this automatically.

LEGEND:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> --- the function has not been verified for the host

x--- the function has been verified for the host
na-- the function is not applicable to the host due to its
     operating system or intended network use

?--- a comment follows for that function in that host


COMMENTS:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">SRI NIC -- both a server telnet and logger exist; however, they
           do not process the telnet messages correctly

MIT Multics  -- we were only able to connect to an interim
          logger that sent a 'ts' message

SDC  -- the logger causes the system to crash following login


      Any discrepancies should be noted via phone call.  This
RFC will be updated in about one month.
