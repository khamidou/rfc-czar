	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   RFC 6310 [RFC6310] specifies the mapping and notification of defect
   states between a pseudowire (PW) and the Attachment Circuit (AC) of
   the end-to-end emulated service.  It standardizes the behavior of
   Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to PW and AC defects for a number
   of technologies (e.g., Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame
   Relay (FR)) emulated over PWs in MPLS and MPLS/IP Packet Switched
   Networks (PSNs).  However, [RFC6310] does not describe this function
   for the Ethernet PW service owing to its unique characteristics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies the mapping of defect states between ACs and
   associated Ethernet PWs connected in accordance with the PWE3
   architecture [RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet
   service.  This document augments the mapping of defect states between
   a PW and associated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in
   [RFC6310].  Similar to [RFC6310], the intent of this document is to
   standardize the behavior of PEs with respect to failures on Ethernet
   ACs and PWs, so that there is no ambiguity about the alarms generated
   and consequent actions undertaken by PEs in response to specific
   failure conditions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Specification of Requirements</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Overview</h2></a>

   There are a number of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) technologies defined for Ethernet, providing various
   functionalities.  This document covers the following Ethernet OAM
   mechanisms and their interworking with PW OAM mechanisms:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Ethernet Link OAM [802.3]
   -  Ethernet Local Management Interface (E-LMI) [MEF16]
   -  Ethernet Continuity Check (CC) [CFM] [Y.1731]
   -  Ethernet Alarm Indication Signaling (AIS) and Remote Defect
      Indication (RDI) [Y.1731]

   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] allows some link defect states to be
   detected and communicated across an Ethernet link.  When an Ethernet
   AC is an Ethernet physical port, there may be some application of
   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3].  Further, E-LMI [MEF16] also allows for
   some Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) defect states to be communicated
   across an Ethernet User Network Interface (UNI) where Ethernet UNI
   constitutes a single-hop Ethernet link (i.e., without any bridges
   compliant with IEEE 802.1Q/.1ad in between).  There may be some
   application of E-LMI [MEF16] for failure notification across single-
   hop Ethernet ACs in certain deployments that specifically do not
   support IEEE Connectivity Fault Management [CFM] and/or ITU-T Y.1731
   [Y.1731], simply referred to as CFM and Y.1731, respectively, in this
   document.  Mechanisms based on Y.1731 and CFM are applicable in all
   types of Ethernet ACs.  Ethernet Link OAM and E-LMI are optional, and
   their applicability is called out, where applicable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Native service (NS) OAM may be transported transparently over the
   corresponding PW as user data.  This is referred to as the "single
   emulated OAM loop mode" per [RFC6310].  For Ethernet, as an example,
   CFM continuity check messages (CCMs) between two Maintenance Entity
   Group End Points (MEPs) can be transported transparently as user data
   over the corresponding PW.  At MEP locations, service failure is
   detected when CCMs are not received over an interval that is 3.5
   times the local CCM transmission interval.  This is one of the
   failure conditions detected via continuity check.  MEP peers can
   exist between customer edge (CE) endpoints (MEPs of a given
   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) reside on the CEs), between PE pairs
   (the MEPs of a given MEG reside on the PEs), or between the CE and PE
   (the MEPs of a given MEG reside on the PE and CE), as long as the MEG
   level nesting rules are maintained.  It should be noted that Ethernet
   allows the definition of up to 8 MEG levels, each comprised of MEPs
   (Down MEPs and Up MEPs) and Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate
   Points (MIPs).  These levels can be nested or touching.  MEPs and
   MIPs generate and process messages in the same MEG level.  Thus, in
   this document, when we refer to messages sent by a MEP or a MIP to a
   peer MEP or MIP, these MEPs and MIPs are in the same MEG level.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When interworking two networking domains, such as native Ethernet and
   PWs to provide an end-to-end emulated service, there is a need to
   identify the failure domain and location even when a PE supports both
   the NS OAM mechanisms and the PW OAM mechanisms.  In addition,
   scalability constraints may not allow running proactive monitoring,
   such as CCMs with transmission enabled, at a PE to detect the failure
   of an EVC across the PW domain.  Thus, network-driven alarms
   generated upon failure detection in the NS or PW domain and their
   mappings to the other domain are needed.  There are also cases where
   a PE MAY not be able to process NS OAM messages received on the PW
   even when such messages are defined, as in the case of Ethernet,
   necessitating the need for fault notification message mapping between
   the PW domain and the NS domain.
   For Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PWs) [RFC5659], Switching PEs (S-PEs) are
   not aware of the NS.  Thus, failure detection and notification at
   S-PEs will be based on PW OAM mechanisms.  Mapping between PW OAM and
   NS OAM will be required at the Terminating PEs (T-PEs) to propagate
   the failure notification to the EVC end points.

	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Abstract Defect States</h3></a>

   Abstract defect states are also introduced in [RFC6310].  As shown in
   Figure 2, this document uses the same conventions as [RFC6310].  It
   may be noted, however, that CE devices, shown in Figure 2, do not
   necessarily have to be end customer devices.  These are essentially
   devices in client network segments that are connecting to the Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) for the emulated services.

      Figure 2: Transmit and Receive Defect States and Notifications
   The procedures outlined in this document define the entry and exit
   criteria for each of the four defect states with respect to Ethernet
   ACs and corresponding PWs; this document also defines the consequent
   actions that PE1 MUST support to properly interwork these defect
   states and corresponding notification messages between the PW domain
   and the native service (NS) domain.  Receive defect state SHOULD have
   precedence over transmit defect state in terms of handling, when both
   transmit and receive defect states are identified simultaneously.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Following is a summary of the defect states from the viewpoint of PE1
   in Figure 2:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  A PW receive defect at PE1 impacts PE1's ability to receive

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  A PW transmit defect at PE1 impacts PE1's ability to send user
      traffic toward CE2.  PE1 MAY be notified of a PW transmit defect
      via a Reverse Defect Indication from PE2, which could point to
      problems associated with PE2's inability to receive traffic on the
      PW or PE2's inability to transmit traffic on its local AC.  Entry
      and exit criteria for the PW transmit defect state are described
      in Section 4.4.2.

   This document uses the following terms with corresponding
   definitions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  MEG Level: identifies a value in the range of 0-7 associated with
      an Ethernet OAM frame.  MEG level identifies the span of the
      Ethernet OAM frame.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  MEG End Point (MEP): is responsible for origination and
      termination of OAM frames for a given MEG.
   -  MEG Intermediate Point (MIP): is located between peer MEPs and can
      process OAM frames but does not initiate them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  MPLS PSN: a PSN that makes use of MPLS Label-Switched Paths
      [RFC3031] as the tunneling technology to forward PW packets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  MPLS/IP PSN: a PSN that makes use of MPLS-in-IP tunneling
      [RFC4023] to tunnel MPLS-labeled PW packets over IP tunnels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, this document also uses the terminology and conventions used
   in [RFC6310].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   PW Status and Defects</h2></a>

   [RFC6310] introduces a range of defects that impact PW status.  All
   these defect conditions are applicable for Ethernet PWs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Similarly, there are different mechanisms described in [RFC6310] to
   detect PW defects, depending on the PSN type (e.g., MPLS PSN or
   MPLS/IP PSN).  Any of these mechanisms can be used when monitoring
   the state of Ethernet PWs.  [RFC6310] also discusses the
   applicability of these failure detection mechanisms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Use of Native Service (NS) Notification</h3></a>

   When two PEs terminate an Ethernet PW with associated MEPs, each PE
   can use native service (NS) OAM capabilities for failure
   notifications by transmitting appropriate NS OAM messages over the
   corresponding PW to the remote PE.  Options include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Sending of AIS frames from the local MEP to the MEP on the remote
      PE when the MEP needs to convey PE receive defects and when CCM
      transmission is disabled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Suspending transmission of CCM frames from the local MEP to the
      peer MEP on the remote PE to convey PE receive defects when CCM
      transmission is enabled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Setting the RDI bit in transmitted CCM frames when loss of CCMs
      from the peer MEP is detected or when the PE needs to convey PW
      reverse defects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Similarly, when the defect conditions are cleared, a PE can take one
   of the following actions, depending on the mechanism that was used
   for failure notification, to clear the defect state on the peer PE:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Stopping AIS frame transmission from the local MEP to the MEP on
      the remote PE to clear PW receive defects.
   -  Resuming transmission of CCM frames from the local MEP to the peer
      MEP on the remote PE to clear PW forward defect notification when
      CCM transmission is enabled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Clearing the RDI bit in transmitted CCM frames to clear PW
      transmit defect notification when CCM transmission is enabled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Use of PW Status Notification for MPLS PSNs</h3></a>

   RFC 4447 [RFC4447] specifies that for PWs that have been set up using
   the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), the default mechanism to
   signal status and defects for ACs and PWs is the LDP status
   notification message.  For PWs established over an MPLS or MPLS/IP
   PSN using other mechanisms (e.g., static configuration), in-band
   signaling using VCCV-BFD [RFC5885] SHOULD be used to convey AC and PW
   status and defects.  Alternatively, the mechanisms defined in
   [RFC6478] MAY be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC6310] identifies the following PW defect status code points:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Forward defect: corresponds to a logical OR of Local Attachment
      Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault, Local PSN-facing PW (egress)
      Transmit Fault, and Pseudowire Not Forwarding fault.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Reverse defect: corresponds to a logical OR of Local Attachment
      Circuit (egress) Transmit Fault and Local PSN-facing PW (ingress)
      Receive Fault.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are also scenarios where a PE carries out PW label withdrawal
   instead of PW status notification.  These include administrative
   disablement of the PW or loss of the Target LDP session with the peer
   PE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   Use of BFD Diagnostic Codes</h3></a>

   When using VCCV, the control channel type and Connectivity
   Verification (CV) type are agreed on between the peer PEs using the
   VCCV parameter field signaled as a sub-TLV of the interface
   parameters TLV when using FEC 129 and the interface parameter sub-TLV
   when using FEC 128 [RFC5085].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As defined in [RFC6310], when a CV type of 0x04 or 0x10 is used to
   indicate that BFD is used for PW fault detection only, PW defect is
   detected via the BFD session while other defects, such as AC defect
   or PE internal defects preventing it from forwarding traffic, are
   communicated via an LDP status notification message in MPLS and
   MPLS/IP PSNs or other mechanisms in L2TP/IP PSNs.
   Similarly, when a CV type of 0x08 or 0x20 is used to indicate that

Appendix A.  Ethernet Native Service Management

   This appendix is informative.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ethernet OAM mechanisms are broadly classified into two categories:
   Fault Management (FM) and Performance Monitoring (PM).  ITU-T Y.1731
   [Y.1731] provides coverage for both FM and PM while IEEE CFM [CFM]
   provides coverage for a subset of FM functions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ethernet OAM also introduces the concept of a Maintenance Entity
   (ME), which is used to identify the entity that needs to be managed.
   An ME is inherently a point-to-point association.  However, in the
   case of a multipoint association, a Maintenance Entity Group (MEG)
   consisting of different MEs is used.  IEEE 802.1 uses the concept of
   a Maintenance Association (MA), which is used to identify both point-
   to-point and multipoint associations.  Each MEG/MA consists of MEG
   End Points (MEPs) that are responsible for originating OAM frames.
   In between the MEPs, there can also be MEG Intermediate Points (MIPs)
   that do not originate OAM frames but do respond to OAM frames from
   MEPs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ethernet OAM allows for hierarchical Maintenance Entities to allow
   for simultaneous end-to-end and segment monitoring.  This is achieved
   by having a provision of up to 8 MEG levels (MD levels), where each
   MEP or MIP is associated with a specific MEG level.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is important to note that the FM mechanisms common to both IEEE
   CFM [CFM] and ITU-T Y.1731 [Y.1731] are completely compatible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The common FM mechanisms include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) Continuity Check Message (CCM)

   2) Loopback Message (LBM) and Loopback Reply (LBR)

   3) Link Trace Message (LTM) and Link Trace Reply (LTR)

   CCMs are used for fault detection, including misconnections and
   misconfigurations.  Typically, CCMs are sent as multicast frames or
   unicast frames and also allow RDI notifications.  LBM and LBR are
   used to perform fault verification, while also allowing for MTU
   verification and CIR/EIR (Committed Information Rate / Excess
   Information Rate) measurements.  LTM and LTR can be used for
   discovering the path traversed between a MEP and another target
   MIP/MEP in the same MEG.  LTM and LTR also allow for fault
   localization.
   In addition, ITU-T Y.1731 [Y.1731] also specifies the following FM

   6) Delay Measurement Message (DMM) and Delay Measurement Reply (DMR)

   7) 1-way Delay Measurement (1DM)

   While LMM and LMR are used to measure Frame Loss Ratio (FLR), DMM and
   DMR are used to measure single-ended (aka two-way) Frame Delay (FD)
   and Frame Delay Variation (FDV, also known as Jitter).  1DM can be
   used for dual-ended (aka one-way) FD and FDV measurements.
