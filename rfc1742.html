                  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing AppleTalk networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 1243 defines a set of MIB objects for managing the lower layers
   of the AppleTalk protocol stack, up to the Network layer.  This memo
   defines additional objects that exist in the AppleTalk portion of the
   MIB.  These objects provide for the management of the transport and
   session layers of the AppleTalk protocol stack, as well as extensions
   to the lower layers.  This is achieved in an upwardly-compatable
   fashion.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  The Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
         describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism,
         which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
         the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 defines MIB-
         II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience
         and new operational requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
         network access to managed objects.
   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Additions and Changes</h2></a>

   This MIB includes additions and changes to RFC 1243.  These changes
   are outlined in the following sections.

                  llapOutPkts
                  llapInNoHandlers
                  llapInErrors

   II.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.4"><h3>2.4   Changes</h3></a>

   The IMPORTS list has been updated to reflect the current SNMP
   documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   New textual conventions have been defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Hyphens have been removed from enumeration strings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Variables used as INDEXes to new tables have ACCESS not-accessible.
   This is because the values of the INDEX variables are contained in
   the object identifier for any of the other variables in the table;
   therefore, it does not need to be explicitly available as data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The atportNetConfig and atportZoneConfig variables have been changed

   The nbpState variable includes new enumerations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Objects</h2></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Format of Definitions</h3></a>

   Section 5 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Overview</h2></a>

   AppleTalk is a protocol suite which features an open peer-to-peer
   architecture that runs over a variety of transmission media.
   AppleTalk is defined in [10].  This protocol suite interoperates with
   the IP protocol suite through various encapsulation methods.  As
   large AppleTalk networks are built that coexist with large IP
   networks, a method to manage the AppleTalk networks with SNMP becomes
   necessary.  This MIB defines managed objects to be used for managing
   AppleTalk networks.
	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Structure of MIB</h3></a>

   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                  - LLAP
                  - AARP
                  - ATPort
                  - DDP
                  - DDP Router
                  - RTMP
                  - RTMP Stub
                  - KIP
                  - ZIP Router
                  - ZIP End Node
                  - NBP
                  - ATEcho
                  - ATP
                  - PAP
                  - ASP
                  - ADSP
                  - ATPortPtoP
                  - Per Port Counters

   These groups are the basic unit of conformance. If the semantics of a
   group is applicable to an implementation, then it must implement all
   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent must implement
   the KIP group if and only if it implements the KIP protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These groups are defined to provide a method for managed agents to
   know which objects they must implement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   The LocalTalk Link Access Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The LocalTalk Link Access Protocol (LLAP) is a medium-speed data-link
   protocol designed for low cost and plug-and-play operation.  The LLAP
   group is designed to manage all interfaces on a managed device that
   use this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) is used to map
   between AppleTalk node addresses, used by the Datagram Delivery
   Protocol, and the addresses of the underlying data link layer.  The
   AARP table allows for management of the Address Mapping Table on the
   managed device.
	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   The AppleTalk Port Group</h3></a>

   An AppleTalk Port is a logical connection to a network over which
   AppleTalk packets can be transmitted.  The "network" could be a
   tunnel, backbone network, point-to-point link, etc, as well as a
   native AppleTalk network.  This group allows the management of the
   configuration of these AppleTalk ports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   The Datagram Delivery Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) is the network-layer protocol
   that is responsible for the socket-to-socket delivery of datagrams
   over the AppleTalk Internet.  This group manages the DDP layer on the
   managed device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The DDP group contains statistical counters for the DDP protocol, and
   a table describing the DDP sockets that have protocol handlers
   registered.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.6"><h3>4.6   The Datagram Delivery Protocol Router Group</h3></a>

   Some variables relevant to the Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) are
   only applicable to AppleTalk routers.  These variables are included
   in this group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.7"><h3>4.7   The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) is used by AppleTalk
   routers to create and maintain the routing tables that dictate the
   process of forwarding datagrams on the AppleTalk internet.  The RTMP
   group manages the RTMP protocol as well as the routing tables
   generated by this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.8"><h3>4.8   The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol Stub Group</h3></a>

   The RTMP Stub process is implemented by end nodes in order to
   maintain information about the routers on their networks.  The
   variables in this group apply to both routers and end nodes.  This
   group manages the RTMP stub process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.9"><h3>4.9   The Kinetics Internet Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The Kinetics Internet Protocol (KIP) is a protocol for encapsulating
   and routing AppleTalk datagrams over an IP internet.  This name is
   historical.  The KIP group manages the KIP routing protocol as well
   as the routing tables generated by this protocol.
	<a name="section-4.10"><h3>4.10   The Zone Information Protocol Router Group</h3></a>

   The Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) is used to maintain a mapping
   between networks and zone names to facilitate the name lookup process
   performed by the Name Binding Protocol.  Some variables relevant to
   the Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) are only applicable to AppleTalk
   routers.  These variables are included in this group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.11"><h3>4.11   The Zone Information Protocol End Node Group</h3></a>

   The ZIP End Node group manages the variables relevant to the Zone
   Information Protocol (ZIP) that are applicable to both routers and
   end nodes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.12"><h3>4.12   The Name Binding Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The Name Binding Protocol (NBP) is a transport-level protocol that is
   used to convert human readable service names into the numeric
   AppleTalk network addresses needed for communicating across the
   AppleTalk network.  The NBP group manages this protocol and the NBP
   services that exist on the managed device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.13"><h3>4.13   The AppleTalk Echo Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The AppleTalk Echo Protocol is a transport-level protocol used to
   test and verify the status of the AppleTalk internet.  The AtEcho
   group manages this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.14"><h3>4.14   The AppleTalk Transaction Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP) is a transport-level
   protocol that is defined to support transaction based communications.
   The ATP group manages this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.15"><h3>4.15   The Printer Access Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The Printer Access Protocol (PAP) is a session-level protocol that
   enables communications between workstations and print servers.  The
   PAP group manages this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.16"><h3>4.16   The AppleTalk Session Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP) is a session-level protocol that
   enables sequences of communications to occur.  ASP uses the services
   of the AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP), but extends these
   services into the session layer.  The ASP group manages this
   protocol.
	<a name="section-4.17"><h3>4.17   The AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol Group</h3></a>

   The AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) is a session-level protocol
   that provides symmetric, connection-oriented, full-duplex
   communication between two sockets on the AppleTalk internet.  In
   addition, ADSP handles flow-control and reliability.  The ADSP group
   manages this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.18"><h3>4.18   The AppleTalk Port Point to Point Group</h3></a>

   The AppleTalk Port Point to Point Group manages ports that have one
   or more associated point-to-point connections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.19"><h3>4.19   The Per Port Counters Group</h3></a>

   The Per Port Counters Group contains a set of counters which are
   deemed useful on a per port basis.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.20"><h3>4.20   Textual Conventions</h3></a>

   New data types are introduced as textual conventions in this MIB
   document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of the
   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if
   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of these
   textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax or the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of this is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   this method are always encoded by means of the rules that define the
   primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
   necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted
   merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the
