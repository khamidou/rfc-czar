                   The application/pkcs10 Media Type

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document specifies a media type used to carry PKCS #10
   certification requests as defined in RFC 2986.  It carries over the
   original specification from RFC 2311, which recently has been moved
   to Historic status, and properly links it to RFC 2986.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   [RFC2311] first defined the application/pkcs10 media type.  When
   [RFC2633] was published, the application/pkcs10 section was dropped,
   but for some reason the text was not incorporated into the PKCS #10
   document [RFC2986].  [RFC2311] was moved to Historic status by
   [RFC5751].  To ensure the IANA media type registration points to a
   non-Historic document, this document updates [RFC2986] with the
   definition of the application/pkcs10 media type and an IANA
   registration based on [RFC4288].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The text for Section 2 is adapted from Section 3.7 of [RFC2311].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Terminology</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Creating a Certification Request</h2></a>

   A typical application that allows a user to generate cryptographic
   information has to submit that information to a Certification
   Authority (CA), who transforms it into a certificate.  PKCS #10
   [RFC2986] describes a syntax for certification requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The details of certification requests and the process of obtaining a
   certificate are beyond the scope of this memo.  Instead, only the
   format of data used in application/pkcs10 is defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Format of the application/pkcs10 Body</h3></a>

   PKCS #10 defines the ASN.1 type CertificationRequest for use in
   submitting a certification request.  For transfer to a CA, this
   abstract syntax needs to be encoded and identified in a unique
   manner.  When the media type application/pkcs10 is used, the body
   MUST be a CertificationRequest.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A robust application SHOULD output Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER), but allow Basic Encoding Rules (BER) or DER on input.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Data produced by BER or DER is 8-bit, but some transports are limited
   to 7-bit data.  In such cases, a suitable 7-bit transfer encoding
   MUST be applied; in MIME-compatible transports, the base64 encoding
   [RFC4648] SHOULD be used with application/pkcs10, although any 7-bit
   transfer encoding may work.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Sending and Receiving an application/pkcs10 Body Part</h3></a>

   For sending a certificate-signing request, the application/pkcs10
   message format MUST be used to convey a PKCS #10 certificate-signing
   request.  Note that for sending certificates and Certificate
   Revocation Lists (CRLs) without any signed content, the
   application/pkcs7-mime message format MUST be used to convey a
   degenerate PKCS #7 signedData "certs-only" message [RFC5751].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To send an application/pkcs10 body, the application generates the
   cryptographic information for the user.  The details of the
   cryptographic information are beyond the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Step 1. The cryptographic information is placed within a PKCS #10
           CertificationRequest.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Step 2. The CertificationRequest is encoded according to BER or DER
           (preferred, DER).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Step 3. As a typical step, the encoded CertificationRequest is also
           base64 encoded so that it is 7-bit data suitable for transfer
           in ESMTP.  This then becomes the body of an
           application/pkcs10 body part.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The result might look like this:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Content-Type: application/pkcs10; name=smime.p10
      Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
      Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=smime.p10

      rfvbnj756tbBghyHhHUujhJhjH77n8HHGT9HG4VQpfyF467GhIGfHfYT6

      0GhIGfHfQbnj756YT64V
   A typical application only needs to send a certification request.  It
   is a Certification Authority that has to receive and process the
   request.  The steps for recovering the CertificationRequest from the
   message are straightforward but are not presented here.  The
   procedures for processing the certification request are beyond the
   scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has updated the registration for the application/pkcs10 media
   subtype in the Application Media Types registry using the filled-in
   template from BCP 13 [RFC4288] given below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Registration of Media Subtype application/pkcs10</h3></a>

   The media subtype for a PKCS #10 certification request is
   application/pkcs10.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type name: application

      Subtype name: pkcs10

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: None

      Encoding considerations: binary; see Section 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Security considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Clients use a certification request to request that a
         Certification Authority certify a public key.  The
         certification request is digitally signed.  Also, see
         Section 6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Interoperability considerations: See Section 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Published specification: This specification.

         [RFC2986].
