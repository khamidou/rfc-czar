</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document presents an object-oriented information model of IP
   Security (IPsec) policy designed to facilitate agreement about the
   content and semantics of IPsec policy, and enable derivations of
   task-specific representations of IPsec policy such as storage schema,
   distribution representations, and policy specification languages used
   to configure IPsec-enabled endpoints.  The information model
   described in this document models the configuration parameters
   defined by IPSec.  The information model also covers the parameters
   found by the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE).  Other key
   exchange protocols could easily be added to the information model by
   a simple extension.  Further extensions can further be added easily
   due to the object-oriented nature of the model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This information model is based upon the core policy classes as
   defined in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and in the Policy
   Core Information Model Extensions (PCIMe).

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   IP security (IPsec) policy may assume a variety of forms as it
   travels from storage, to distribution, to decision points.  At each
   step, it needs to be represented in a way that is convenient for the
   current task.  For example, the policy could exist as, but is not
   limited to:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] schema in a
      directory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An on-the-wire representation over a transport protocol like the
      Common Object Policy Service (COPS) [COPS, COPSPR].
   o  A text-based policy specification language suitable for editing by
      an administrator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  An Extensible Markup Language (XML) document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each of these task-specific representations should be derived from a
   canonical representation that precisely specifies the content and
   semantics of the IPsec policy.  This document captures this concept
   and introduces a task-independent canonical representation for IPsec
   policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document focuses mainly on the existing protocols [COMP, ESP,
   AH, DOI, IKE].  The model can easily be extended if needed due to its
   object-oriented nature.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document is organized as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 2 provides a quick introduction to the Unified Modeling
      Language (UML) graphical notation conventions used in this
      document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 3 provides the inheritance hierarchy that describes where
      the IPsec policy classes fit into the policy class hierarchy
      already defined by the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and
      Policy Core Information Model Extensions (PCIMe).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Sections 4 through 8 describe the classes that make up the IPsec
      policy model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Section 9 presents the implementation requirements for the classes
      in the model (i.e., the MUST/MAY/SHOULD status).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  UML Conventions</h2></a>

   For this document, a UML static class diagram was chosen as the
   canonical representation for the IPsec policy model, because UML
   provides a graphical, task-independent way to model systems.  A
   treatise on the graphical notation used in UML is beyond the scope of
   this paper.  However, given the use of ASCII drawing for UML static
   class diagrams, a description of the notational conventions used in
   this document is in order:
   o  Boxes represent classes, with class names in brackets ([])
      representing an abstract class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A line that terminates with an arrow (<, >, ^, v) denotes
      inheritance.  The arrow always points to the parent class.
      Inheritance can also be called generalization or specialization
      (depending upon the reference point).  A base class is a
      generalization of a derived class, and a derived class is a
      specialization of a base class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Associations are used to model a relationship between two classes.
      Classes that share an association are connected using a line.  A
      special kind of association is also used:  an aggregation.  An
      aggregation models a whole-part relationship between two classes.
      Associations, and therefore aggregations, are also modeled as
      classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A line that begins with an "o" denotes aggregation.  Aggregation
      denotes containment in which the contained class and the
      containing class have independent lifetimes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  At each end of a line representing an association appears a
      cardinality (i.e., each association has 2 cardinalities).
      Cardinalities indicate the constraints on the number of object
      instances in a set of relationships.  The cardinality on a given
      end of an association indicates the number of different object
      instances of that class that may be associated with a single
      object instance of the class on the other end of the association.
      The cardinality may be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  a range in the form "lower bound..upper bound" indicating the
         minimum and maximum number of objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  a number that indicates the exact number of objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  an asterisk indicating any number of objects, including zero.
         An asterisk is shorthand for 0..n.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -  the letter n indicating from 1 to many.  The letter n is
         shorthand for 1..n.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A class that has an association may have a "w" next to the line
      representing the association.  This is called a weak association
      and is discussed in [PCIM].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that the UML static class diagram presented is a
   conceptual view of IPsec policy designed to aid in understanding.  It
   does not necessarily get translated class for class into another
   representation.  For example, an LDAP implementation may flatten out
   the representation to fewer classes (because of the inefficiency of
   following references).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  IPsec Policy Model Inheritance Hierarchy</h2></a>

   Like PCIM and PCIMe, the IPsec Configuration Policy Model derives
   from and uses classes defined in the DMTF [DMTF] Common Information
   Model (CIM).  The following tree represents the inheritance hierarchy
   for the IPsec Policy Model classes and how they fit into PCIM, PCIMe
   and the other DMTF models (see Appendices for descriptions of classes
   that are not being introduced as part of IPsec model).  CIM classes
   that are not used as a superclass to derive new classes, but are used
   only as references, are not included in this inheritance hierarchy,
   but can be found in the appropriate DMTF document:  Core Model
   [CIMCORE], User Model [CIMUSER] or, Network Model [CIMNETWORK].

       RuleUsage, Mandatory, SequencedActions, PolicyRoles, and
       PolicyDecisionStrategy

   For a description of these properties, see [PCIM] and [PCIME].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In SARule subclass instances:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  if the property Mandatory exists, it MUST be set to "true".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  if the property SequencedActions exists, it MUST be set to

   -  the property PolicyRoles is not used in the device-level model.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  if the property PolicyDecisionStrategy exists, it must be set to
      "FirstMatching".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.2"><h4>4.1.2  The Property ExecutionStrategy</h4></a>

   The ExecutionStrategy properties in the PolicyRule subclasses (and in
   the CompoundPolicyAction class) determine the behavior of the
   contained actions.  It defines the strategy to be used in executing
   the sequenced actions aggregated by a rule or a compound action.  In
   the case of actions within a rule, the PolicyActionInSARule
   aggregation is used to collect the actions into an ordered set; in
   the case of a compound action, the PolicyActionInPolicyAction
   aggregation is used to collect the actions into an ordered subset.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are three execution strategies: do until success, do all, and
   do until failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "Do Until Success" causes the execution of actions according to the
   ActionOrder property in the aggregation instances until a successful
   execution of a single action.  These actions may be evaluated to
   determine if they are appropriate to execute rather than blindly
   trying each of the actions until one succeeds.  For an initiator,
   they are tried in the ActionOrder until the list is exhausted or one
   completes successfully.  For example, an IKE initiator may have
   several IKEActions for the same SACondition.  The initiator will try
   all IKEActions in the order defined by ActionOrder.  I.e., it will
   possibly try several phase 1 negotiations with different modes (main
   mode then aggressive mode) and/or with multiple IKE peers.  For a
   responder, when there is more than one action in the rule with "do
   until success" condition clause, this provides alternative actions
   depending on the received proposals.  For example, the same IKERule
   may be used to handle aggressive mode and main mode negotiations with
   different actions.  The responder uses the first appropriate action
   in the list of actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "Do All" causes the execution of all the actions in the aggregated
   set according to their defined order.  The execution continues
   regardless of failures.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "Do Until Failure" causes the execution of all actions according to a
   predefined order until the first failure in execution of an action
   instance.  Please note that if all actions are successful, then the
   aggregated result is a failure.  This execution strategy is inherited
   from [PCIME] and is not expected to be of any use for IPsec
   configuration.
   For example, in a nested SAs case, the actions of an initiator's rule
   might be structured as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IPsecRule.ExecutionStrategy='Do All'
   |
   +---1--- IPsecTunnelAction    // set up SA from host to gateway
   |
   +---2--- IPsecTransportAction // set up SA from host through
                                 // tunnel to remote host

   Another example, showing a rule with fallback actions might be
   structured as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IPsecRule.ExecutionStrategy='Do Until Success'
   |
   +---6--- IPsecTransportAction // negotiate SA with peer
   |
   +---9--- IPsecBypassAction    // but if you must, allow in the clear

   The CompoundPolicyAction class (See [PCIME]) may be used in
   constructing the actions of IKE and IPsec rules when those rules
   specify both multiple actions and fallback actions.  The
   ExecutionStrategy property in CompoundPolicyAction is used in
   conjunction with that in the PolicyRule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, in nesting SAs with a fallback security gateway, the
   actions of a rule might be structured as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IPsecRule.ExecutionStrategy='Do All'
   |
   +---1--- CompoundPolicyAction.ExecutionStrategy='Do Until Success'
   |        |
   |        +---1--- IPsecTunnelAction  // set up SA from host to
   |        |                           // gateway1
   |        |
   |        +---2--- IPsecTunnelAction  // or set up SA to gateway2
   |
   +---2--- IPsecTransportAction        // then set up SA from host
                                        // through tunnel to remote
                                        // host

   In the case of "Do All", a couple of actions can be executed
   successfully before a subsequent action fails.  In this case, some
   IKE or IPsec actions may have resulted in SAs creation.  Even if the
   net effect of the aggregated actions is failure, those created SAs
   MAY be kept or MAY be deleted.
   In the case of "Do All", the IPsec selectors to be used during IPsec
   SA negotiation are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  for the last IPsecAction of the aggregation (i.e., usually the
      innermost IPsec SA): this is the combination of the
      IPHeadersFilter class and of the Granularity property of the
      IPsecAction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  for all other IPsecActions of the aggregation: the selector is the
      source IP address which is the local IP address, and the
      destination IP address is the PeerGateway IP address of the
      following IPsecAction of the "Do All" aggregation.  NB: the
      granularity is IP address to IP address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the above behavior is not desirable, the alternative is to define
   several SARules, one for each IPsec SA to be built.  This will allow
   the definition of specific IPsec selectors for all IPsecActions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.3"><h4>4.1.3   The Property LimitNegotiation</h4></a>

   The property LimitNegotiation is used as part of processing either an
   IKE or an IPsec rule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Before proceeding with a phase 1 negotiation, this property is
   checked to determine whether the negotiation role of the rule matches
   that defined for the negotiation being undertaken (e.g., Initiator,
   Responder, or Both).  If this check fails (e.g., the current role is
   IKE responder, while the rule specifies IKE initiator), then the IKE
   negotiation is stopped.  Note that this only applies to new IKE phase
   1 negotiations and has no effect on either renegotiation or refresh
   operations with peers for which an established SA already exists.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Before proceeding with a phase 2 negotiation, the LimitNegotiation
   property of the IPsecRule is first checked to determine if the
   negotiation role indicated for the rule matches that of the current
   negotiation (Initiator, Responder, or Either).  Note that this limit
   applies only to new phase 2 negotiations.  It is ignored when an
   attempt is made to refresh an expiring SA (either side can initiate a
   refresh operation).  The IKE system can determine that the
   negotiation is a refresh operation by checking to see if the selector
   information matches that of an existing SA.  If LimitNegotiation does
   not match and the selector corresponds to a new SA, the negotiation
   is stopped.

   for use in different situations.  The combination of the interface
   (represented by the IPProtocolEndpoint or by a collection of
   IPProtocolEndpoints), the identity type (as specified in the
   IKEAction), and the IdentityContexts specifies a unique identity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IdentityContexts property specifies the context to select the

   collection of IPProtocolEndpoints).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IdentityContexts is an array of strings.  The multiple values in the

   Each value in the array may be the composition of multiple context

   value is a composition, the individual values are logically ANDed

   The class SACondition defines the conditions of rules for IKE and
   IPsec negotiations.  Conditions are associated with policy rules via
   the SAConditionInRule aggregation.  It is used as an anchor point to
   associate various types of filters with policy rules via the

   can be accepted for a particular policy rule via the
   AcceptCredentialsFrom association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Associated objects represent components of the condition that may or
   may not apply at a given rule evaluation.  For example, an
   AcceptCredentialsFrom evaluation is only performed when a credential

   be evaluated when an IDPayload value is available to compare with the

   The property DoActionLogging specifies whether a log message is to be

   The class ContainedTransform associates an IPsecProposal with the set
   of SATransforms that make up the proposal.  If multiple transforms of
   the same type are in a proposal, then they are to be logically ORed
   and the order of preference is dictated by the SequenceNumber
   property.  Sets of transforms of different types are logically ANDed.
   For example, if the ordered proposal list were

      ESP = { (HMAC-MD5, 3DES), (HMAC-MD5, DES) }
      AH  = { MD5, SHA-1 }

   then the one sending the proposal would want the other side to pick
   one from the ESP transform (preferably (HMAC-MD5, 3DES)) list AND one
   from the AH transform list (preferably MD5).

	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document only describes an information model for IPsec policy.
   It does not detail security requirements for storage or delivery of
   said information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Physical models derived from this information model MUST implement
   the relevant security for storage and delivery.  Most of the classes
   (e.g., IpHeadersFilter, SAAction,...) MUST at least provided the
   integrity service; other pieces of information MUST also receive the
   confidentiality service (e.g., SharedSecret as described in the
   classes PeerIdentityEntry and PreconfiguredSAAction).
