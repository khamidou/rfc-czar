  Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Key Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This specification defines a new mobility option for allowing the
   mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor to negotiate
   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation mode and exchange
   the downlink and uplink GRE keys that are used for marking the
   downlink and uplink traffic that belong to a specific mobility
   session.  In addition, the same mobility option can be used to
   negotiate the GRE encapsulation mode without exchanging the GRE keys.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] and IPv4 Support for
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5844] allow the use of IPv6 and IPv4
   encapsulation modes as specified in [RFC2473] and [RFC2003] for the
   tunneled traffic between the local mobility anchor (LMA) and the
   mobile access gateway (MAG).  There are scenarios where these
   encapsulation modes are not sufficient to uniquely identify the
   destination of packets of a specific mobility session.  Thus, there
   is a need for an encapsulation mode with richer semantics.  The
   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784], and the Key extension
   as defined in [RFC2890], has the required semantics to allow such a
   distinction for use in Proxy Mobile IPv6.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification defines the GRE Key option to be used for the
   negotiation of GRE encapsulation mode and exchange of the uplink and
   downlink GRE keys.  The negotiated downlink and uplink GRE keys can
   be used for marking the downlink and uplink traffic for a specific
   mobility session.  In addition, this specification enables the mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor to negotiate the use of
   GRE encapsulation mode without exchanging the GRE keys.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification has no impact on IPv4 or IPv6 mobile nodes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions and Terminology</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Conventions</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Terminology</h3></a>

   All the general mobility-related terminology and abbreviations are to
   be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC5213], and IPv4 Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5844]
   specifications.  The following terms are used in this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Downlink Traffic

      The traffic in the tunnel between the local mobility anchor and
      the mobile access gateway, heading towards the mobile access
      gateway and tunneled at the local mobility anchor.  This traffic
      is also called forward direction traffic.
   Uplink Traffic

      The traffic in the tunnel between the mobile access gateway and
      the local mobility anchor, heading towards the local mobility
      anchor and tunneled at the mobile access gateway.  This traffic is
      also called reverse direction traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Downlink GRE Key

      The GRE key is assigned by the mobile access gateway and used by
      the local mobility anchor to mark the downlink traffic that
      belongs to a specific mobility session as described in this
      specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Uplink GRE Key

      The GRE key is assigned by the local mobility anchor and used by
      the mobile access gateway to mark the uplink traffic that belongs
      to a specific mobility session as described in this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
   A Policy Check

      When a local mobility anchor receives an initial, handoff-
      triggered Binding Lifetime Extension, or Binding Lifetime
      Extension Proxy Binding Update for a mobility session, the local
      mobility anchor determines if the GRE encapsulation mode only or
      GRE encapsulation and GRE keys are required based on a policy
      check.  This policy could be a per-MAG-LMA pair, a per-LMA local
      policy, a per-MN policy, or the combination of any of them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   GRE Encapsulation and Key Exchange</h2></a>

   This section describes how GRE encapsulation mode is negotiated and
   the GRE keys are dynamically exchanged using Proxy Mobile IPv6
   protocol [RFC5213] signaling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   GRE Encapsulation Overview</h3></a>

   Using the GRE Key option defined in this specification, the mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor can negotiate GRE
   encapsulation mode only or GRE encapsulation mode and exchange the
   GRE keys for marking the downlink and uplink traffic.  In the case
   when GRE encapsulation mode only is negotiated between the mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor, then no GRE keys are
   used.
   However, once the GRE keys have been exchanged between the mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor as per this
   specification, the mobile access gateway will use the uplink GRE key
   that is assigned by the local mobility anchor in the GRE header of
   the uplink payload packet.  Similarly, the local mobility anchor will
   use the downlink GRE key as negotiated with the mobile access gateway
   in the GRE header of the downlink payload packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following illustration explains the use of GRE encapsulation mode
   and the GRE keys for supporting the usecase where overlapping IPv4
   private address [RFC1918] allocation is in use.

    Figure 1: GRE Tunneling for IPv4 Private Address Space Overlapping

   Figure 1 illustrates a local mobility anchor providing mobility
   service to mobile nodes that are from different operators and are
   assigned IPv4 addresses from overlapping private address space.  In
   this scenario, the mobile access gateway and the local mobility
   anchor must be able to distinguish flows belonging to different
   operators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mobile nodes MN-1 and MN-2 are visiting from Operator-A, and the
   mobile nodes MN-3 and MN-4 are visiting from Operator-B.  The mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor exchange a specific pair
   of downlink and uplink GRE keys and save them as part of the mobile
   node's binding to be used for identifying the flows belonging to each
   mobile node.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LMA and the MAG will be able to distinguish each mobile node
   flow(s) based on the GRE key present in the GRE header of the
   tunneled payload packet, and route them accordingly.  However, the
   GRE keys, as in this specification, apply to the individual mobility
   binding updated by the Proxy Binding Update but not to all bindings
   that the mobile may have registered following procedures described in
   [RFC5648].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   GRE Encapsulation Mode Only</h3></a>

   In order for the mobile access gateway to request GRE encapsulation
   mode only without exchanging the GRE keys, the mobile access gateway
   MUST include the GRE Key option but omit the GRE Key Identifier field
   in the Proxy Binding Update.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the local mobility anchor supports GRE encapsulation and the
   received Proxy Binding Update contains the GRE Key option but the GRE
   Key Identifier field is omitted, the mobile access gateway is
   requesting GRE encapsulation without exchanging the GRE keys
   dynamically.  If the Proxy Binding Update processing is successful,
   the local mobility anchor sends a successful Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message with the GRE Key option but the GRE Key
   Identifier field is omitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor
   successfully negotiate the GRE encapsulation mode only, then no GRE
   keys are used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   GRE Encapsulation and Key Exchange</h3></a>

   The following subsections describe how the mobile access gateway and
   the local mobility anchor negotiate GRE encapsulation and exchange
   downlink and uplink GRE keys using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 registration
   procedure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1   Initial GRE Key Exchange</h4></a>

   When the mobile access gateway determines, based on, e.g., private
   IPv4 address support [RFC1918], the mobile access gateway local
   policy, or the MAG-LMA peer agreement, that GRE encapsulation is
   needed and GRE keys are required, the mobile access gateway MUST
   include the GRE Key option in the initial Proxy Binding Update
   message sent to the local mobility anchor.  The mobile access gateway
   MUST include the downlink GRE key in the GRE Key Identifier field of
   the GRE Key option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After the local mobility anchor successfully processes the initial
   Proxy Binding Update and accepts the GRE encapsulation request and
   the downlink GRE key based on a policy check, the local mobility
   anchor MUST include the GRE Key option with the uplink GRE key in the
   GRE Key Identifier field in a successful Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement and send it to the mobile access gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2   GRE Key Exchange during Binding Re-Registration</h4></a>

   If the local mobility anchor has successfully negotiated and
   exchanged the initial GRE keys with the mobile access gateway for a
   specific mobile node's mobility session, the local mobility anchor
   MUST maintain the same negotiated uplink GRE key for the lifetime of
   that mobility session.  However, for administrative reasons, e.g.,
   local mobility anchor reboot, the local mobility anchor MAY change
   the uplink GRE key for the mobility session.  In that case, some
   packet loss may be experienced.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the mobile access gateway has successfully negotiated and
   exchanged the initial GRE keys with the local mobility anchor for a
   specific mobile node's mobility session, the mobile access gateway
   MUST include the GRE Key option with the downlink GRE key in the
   Proxy Binding Update that is used to request a Binding Lifetime
   Extension.  In this case, if the local mobility anchor successfully
   processes the Proxy Binding Update message, the local mobility anchor
   MUST return the same uplink GRE key that was exchanged with the
   mobile access gateway in the last successful Proxy Binding Update for
   the same mobility session in the GRE Key option in a successful Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, during inter-MAG handoff and if the new mobile access
   gateway determines, based on, e.g., private IPv4 address support, the
   mobile access gateway local policy, the MAG-LMA peer agreement, or an
   indication during the handoff process, that GRE encapsulation and GRE
   keys exchange are required, the new mobile access gateway MUST
   include the GRE Key option with the downlink GRE key in the Proxy
   Binding Update that is used to request an after-handoff Binding
   Lifetime Extension.  In this case, the new mobile access gateway may
   either pick a new downlink GRE key or use the downlink GRE key that
   was used by the previous mobile access gateway for the same binding.
   For the new mobile access gateway to know the downlink GRE key used
   by the previous mobile access gateway, it may require transfer of
   context from the previous mobile access gateway to the new mobile
   access gateway during a handoff.  Such mechanisms are out of scope
   for this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the local mobility anchor successfully processes a handoff-
   triggered Binding Lifetime Extension Proxy Binding Update message
   that contains a GRE Key option with a downlink GRE key included, the
   local mobility anchor MUST return the same uplink GRE key that was
   exchanged with the previous mobile access gateway for the same
   mobility session in the GRE Key option in a successful Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the local mobility anchor receives a handoff-triggered Binding
   Lifetime Extension Proxy Binding Update message without the GRE Key
   option for a Binding Cache entry (BCE) that is using GRE keys and GRE
   encapsulation, the local mobility anchor makes a policy check
   regarding GRE encapsulation and GRE key exchange.  If, according to
   the policy check, GRE encapsulation and GRE key exchange are
   required, the local mobility anchor MUST reject the Proxy Binding
   Update by sending a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with the
   Status field set to GRE_KEY_OPTION_REQUIRED as defined in
   Section 6.4.  Otherwise, the local mobility anchor SHOULD accept the
   Proxy Binding Update, and if it is processed successfully, the local
   mobility anchor MUST return a successful Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement without including the GRE Key option.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Mobile Access Gateway Considerations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Extensions to the Conceptual Data Structure</h3></a>

   Every mobile access gateway maintains a Binding Update List (BUL)
   entry for each currently attached mobile node, as explained in
   Section 6.1 of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213].  To
   support this specification, the conceptual Binding Update List entry
   data structure must be extended with the following four new
   additional fields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A flag (GRE-encapsulation-enabled) is used for indicating whether
      GRE encapsulation is enabled for the mobile node's traffic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The downlink GRE key used in the GRE encapsulation header of the
      tunneled payload packet from the local mobility anchor to the
      mobile access gateway that is destined to the mobile node.  This
      GRE key is generated by the mobile access gateway and communicated
      to the local mobility anchor in the GRE Key option in the Proxy
      Binding Update message.
   o  The uplink GRE key used in the GRE encapsulation header of the
      tunneled payload packet from the mobile access gateway to the
      local mobility anchor that is originating from the mobile node.
      This GRE key is obtained from the GRE Key Identifier field of the
      GRE Key option present in the received Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message sent by the local mobility anchor as
      specified in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A flag indicating whether UDP-based TLV-header format

      is TRUE only when UDP tunneling as in [RFC5844] and GRE
      encapsulation as in this specification are both enabled for this
      mobility session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Operational Summary</h3></a>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the mobile access gateway determines that GRE encapsulation and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  After receiving a successful Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message

   When a UDP-based tunneling format is used between the mobile access

   negotiated during the Proxy Binding Update/Acknowledgement exchange
   as described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.  If the TLV-header format is
   agreed upon between the mobile access gateway and local mobility
   anchor, the local mobility anchor expects the TLV header to follow
   the UDP header as shown in Figure 5.  The TLV header contains the
   Type field, the following payload packet header type, and its length.
   The Type field in the TLV header is always set to a value of 0 to
   enhance the processing of the received packet by ensuring that the
   receiver can differentiate whether what came after the UDP header is
   a TLV-header Type field or an IP version field of an IP header.
   Hence, the TLV header can carry traffic other than IP as indicated in
   the Next Header field.  The distinction between IP and TLV
   encapsulation is needed, because the Proxy Binding Update (IP packet)
   and the data packets (GRE packets) can be sent over the same UDP

   with the GRE Key option and TLV-header format (T) flag set and, based
   on a policy check, the LMA determines that GRE encapsulation is
   required and the LMA supports TLV-header tunneling and the LMA sent a
   successful Proxy Binding Acknowledgement with the TLV-header format
   (T) flag set, the LMA MUST update the mobile node's Binding Cache
   entry described in Section 5.1 by setting the GRE-encapsulation-
   enabled flag and update the uplink and downlink GRE key fields.  In
   addition, the LMA MUST set the UDP-based TLV-header format flag.
   If the LMA receives a Proxy Binding Update with the GRE Key option
   and TLV-header format (T) flag set and, based on a policy check, the
   LMA determines that GRE encapsulation is required BUT the LMA does
   NOT support TLV-header tunneling and if the Proxy Binding Update has
   been successfully processed, the LMA MUST send a successful Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement with the status code
   GRE_TUNNELING_BUT_TLV_HEADER_NOT_SUPPORTED.  This way, the LMA
   indicates to the mobile access gateway that GRE encapsulation has
   been successfully negotiated BUT TLV-header UDP-based tunneling
   format is not supported.  In this case, the LMA MUST update the
   mobile node's BCE described in Section 5.1 by setting the GRE
   encapsulation enabled flag and update the uplink and downlink GRE key
   fields.  In this case, the LMA MUST set the UDP-based TLV-header
   format flag to FALSE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway have
   successfully negotiated the TLV-header UDP-based tunneling format and
   GRE encapsulation for a specific mobility session, the local mobility
   anchor processes data packets as described in the following
   subsection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.4.1"><h4>7.4.1   Sending and Receiving Data Packets</h4></a>

   The local mobility anchor may use GRE encapsulation for tunneling an
   IPv6 or IPv4 data packet to the mobile access gateway.  If the local
   mobility anchor has successfully negotiated GRE encapsulation with
   the mobile access gateway for a specific mobility session, the local
   mobility anchor encapsulates and decapsulates IPv6-or-IPv4 payload
   data packets following the rules described in [RFC5213] and [RFC5844]
   while ensuring that the GRE header is present as shown in Figure 7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the case when TLV-tunneling format and GRE encapsulation for a
   specific mobility session have been successfully negotiated between
   the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway, the local
   mobility anchor follows the TLV-header UDP-based tunneling format and
   header order as shown in Figure 5 to encapsulate IPv4 or IPv6 payload
   packets in IPv4 before sending the IPv4 packet to the mobile access
   gateway.  In this case, the source and the destination of the IPv4
   outer header are IPv4-LMAA and IPv4-Proxy-CoA, respectively.  In
   addition, the source and the destination IP addresses of the IPv6-or-
   IPv4 payload data packet are IPv6/IPv4-CN-Addr and IPv6/IPv4-MN-HoA,
   respectively.  On the other hand, the local mobility anchor ensures
   the same TLV-header UDP-based tunneling format and header order when
   it decapsulates received IPv4 packets from the mobile access gateway
   for the same mobility session.
	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   This specification defines a new mobility option, the GRE Key option,
   described in Section 6.1.  This option is carried in the Mobility
   Header.  The type value for this option has been assigned from the
   same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility options
   defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC3775].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification also defines three new Binding Acknowledgement
   status codes as described in Section 6.4 and IANA has allocated the
   numeric values as specified in Section 6.4 from the "Status Codes"
   registry of the Mobility IPv6 Parameters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The GRE Key option, defined in this specification, when carried in
   Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages,
   reveals the group affiliation of a mobile node identified by its
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) or an IP address.  It may help an
   attacker in targeting flows belonging to a specific group.  This
   vulnerability can be prevented, by enabling confidentiality
   protection on the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages where the presence of the NAI and GRE Key
   options establish a mobile node's relation to a specific group.  This
   vulnerability can also be avoided by enabling confidentiality
   protection on all the tunneled data packets between the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor, for hiding all the markings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], the use of IPsec [RFC4301] for
   protecting a mobile node's data traffic is optional.  Additionally,
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 recommends the use of Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in tunnel mode when using ESP for protecting
   the mobile node's data traffic.  However, when GRE encapsulation is
   used, both IPsec tunnel mode and transport mode can be used to
   protect the GRE header.  The IPsec traffic selectors will contain the
   protocol number for GRE, and there is currently no mechanism to use
   the GRE key as a traffic selector.
