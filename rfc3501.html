   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1)
   allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on
   a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote
   message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local
   folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline
   client to resynchronize with the server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
   mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages,
   setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching,
   and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions
   thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.
   These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique
   identifiers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing
   configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is
   discussed in RFC 2244.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
   handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821.

IMAP4rev1 Protocol Specification

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.       How to Read This Document</h2></a>

	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1     Organization of This Document</h3></a>

   This document is written from the point of view of the implementor of
   an IMAP4rev1 client or server.  Beyond the protocol overview in
   section 2, it is not optimized for someone trying to understand the
   operation of the protocol.  The material in sections 3 through 5
   provides the general context and definitions with which IMAP4rev1
   operates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Sections 6, 7, and 9 describe the IMAP commands, responses, and
   syntax, respectively.  The relationships among these are such that it
   is almost impossible to understand any of them separately.  In
   particular, do not attempt to deduce command syntax from the command
   section alone; instead refer to the Formal Syntax section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2     Conventions Used in This Document</h3></a>

   "Conventions" are basic principles or procedures.  Document
   conventions are noted in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The word "can" (not "may") is used to refer to a possible
   circumstance or situation, as opposed to an optional facility of the
   protocol.
   "User" is used to refer to a human user, whereas "client" refers to
   the software being run by the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "Connection" refers to the entire sequence of client/server
   interaction from the initial establishment of the network connection
   until its termination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   "Session" refers to the sequence of client/server interaction from
   the time that a mailbox is selected (SELECT or EXAMINE command) until
   the time that selection ends (SELECT or EXAMINE of another mailbox,
   CLOSE command, or connection termination).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Characters are 7-bit US-ASCII unless otherwise specified.  Other
   character sets are indicated using a "CHARSET", as described in
   [MIME-IMT] and defined in [CHARSET].  CHARSETs have important
   additional semantics in addition to defining character set; refer to
   these documents for more detail.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are several protocol conventions in IMAP.  These refer to
   aspects of the specification which are not strictly part of the IMAP
   protocol, but reflect generally-accepted practice.  Implementations
   need to be aware of these conventions, and avoid conflicts whether or
   not they implement the convention.  For example, "&" may not be used
   as a hierarchy delimiter since it conflicts with the Mailbox
   International Naming Convention, and other uses of "&" in mailbox
   names are impacted as well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3     Special Notes to Implementors</h3></a>

   Implementors of the IMAP protocol are strongly encouraged to read the
   IMAP implementation recommendations document [IMAP-IMPLEMENTATION] in
   conjunction with this document, to help understand the intricacies of
   this protocol and how best to build an interoperable product.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IMAP4rev1 is designed to be upwards compatible from the [IMAP2] and
   unpublished IMAP2bis protocols.  IMAP4rev1 is largely compatible with
   the IMAP4 protocol described in RFC 1730; the exception being in
   certain facilities added in RFC 1730 that proved problematic and were
   subsequently removed.  In the course of the evolution of IMAP4rev1,
   some aspects in the earlier protocols have become obsolete.  Obsolete
   commands, responses, and data formats which an IMAP4rev1
   implementation can encounter when used with an earlier implementation
   are described in [IMAP-OBSOLETE].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other compatibility issues with IMAP2bis, the most common variant of
   the earlier protocol, are discussed in [IMAP-COMPAT].  A full
   discussion of compatibility issues with rare (and presumed extinct)
   variants of [IMAP2] is in [IMAP-HISTORICAL]; this document is
   primarily of historical interest.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IMAP was originally developed for the older [RFC-822] standard, and
   as a consequence several fetch items in IMAP incorporate "RFC822" in
   their name.  With the exception of RFC822.SIZE, there are more modern
   replacements; for example, the modern version of RFC822.HEADER is
   BODY.PEEK[HEADER].  In all cases, "RFC822" should be interpreted as a
   reference to the updated [RFC-2822] standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.       Protocol Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1     Link Level</h3></a>

   The IMAP4rev1 protocol assumes a reliable data stream such as that
   provided by TCP.  When TCP is used, an IMAP4rev1 server listens on
   port 143.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2     Commands and Responses</h3></a>

   An IMAP4rev1 connection consists of the establishment of a
   client/server network connection, an initial greeting from the
   server, and client/server interactions.  These client/server
   interactions consist of a client command, server data, and a server
   completion result response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All interactions transmitted by client and server are in the form of
   lines, that is, strings that end with a CRLF.  The protocol receiver
   of an IMAP4rev1 client or server is either reading a line, or is
   reading a sequence of octets with a known count followed by a line.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.1"><h4>2.2.1   Client Protocol Sender and Server Protocol Receiver</h4></a>

   The client command begins an operation.  Each client command is
   prefixed with an identifier (typically a short alphanumeric string,
   e.g., A0001, A0002, etc.) called a "tag".  A different tag is
   generated by the client for each command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Clients MUST follow the syntax outlined in this specification
   strictly.  It is a syntax error to send a command with missing or
   extraneous spaces or arguments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are two cases in which a line from the client does not
   represent a complete command.  In one case, a command argument is
   quoted with an octet count (see the description of literal in String
   under Data Formats); in the other case, the command arguments require
   server feedback (see the AUTHENTICATE command).  In either case, the
   server sends a command continuation request response if it is ready
   for the octets (if appropriate) and the remainder of the command.
   This response is prefixed with the token "+".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: If instead, the server detected an error in the
        command, it sends a BAD completion response with a tag
        matching the command (as described below) to reject the
        command and prevent the client from sending any more of the
        command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        It is also possible for the server to send a completion
        response for some other command (if multiple commands are
        in progress), or untagged data.  In either case, the
        command continuation request is still pending; the client
        takes the appropriate action for the response, and reads
        another response from the server.  In all cases, the client
        MUST send a complete command (including receiving all
        command continuation request responses and command
        continuations for the command) before initiating a new
        command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The protocol receiver of an IMAP4rev1 server reads a command line
   from the client, parses the command and its arguments, and transmits
   server data and a server command completion result response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.2"><h4>2.2.2   Server Protocol Sender and Client Protocol Receiver</h4></a>

   Data transmitted by the server to the client and status responses
   that do not indicate command completion are prefixed with the token
   "*", and are called untagged responses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Server data MAY be sent as a result of a client command, or MAY be
   sent unilaterally by the server.  There is no syntactic difference
   between server data that resulted from a specific command and server
   data that were sent unilaterally.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The server completion result response indicates the success or
   failure of the operation.  It is tagged with the same tag as the
   client command which began the operation.  Thus, if more than one
   command is in progress, the tag in a server completion response
   identifies the command to which the response applies.  There are
   three possible server completion responses: OK (indicating success),
   NO (indicating failure), or BAD (indicating a protocol error such as
   unrecognized command or command syntax error).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers SHOULD enforce the syntax outlined in this specification
   strictly.  Any client command with a protocol syntax error, including
   (but not limited to) missing or extraneous spaces or arguments,
   SHOULD be rejected, and the client given a BAD server completion
   response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The protocol receiver of an IMAP4rev1 client reads a response line
   from the server.  It then takes action on the response based upon the
   first token of the response, which can be a tag, a "*", or a "+".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A client MUST be prepared to accept any server response at all times.
   This includes server data that was not requested.  Server data SHOULD
   be recorded, so that the client can reference its recorded copy
   rather than sending a command to the server to request the data.  In
   the case of certain server data, the data MUST be recorded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This topic is discussed in greater detail in the Server Responses
   section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3     Message Attributes</h3></a>

   In addition to message text, each message has several attributes
   associated with it.  These attributes can be retrieved individually
   or in conjunction with other attributes or message texts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.1"><h4>2.3.1   Message Numbers</h4></a>

   Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by one of two numbers; the unique
   identifier or the message sequence number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
<a name="section-2.3.1.1"><h4>2.3.1.1         Unique Identifier (UID) Message Attribute</h4></a>
                    

   A 32-bit value assigned to each message, which when used with the
   unique identifier validity value (see below) forms a 64-bit value
   that MUST NOT refer to any other message in the mailbox or any
   subsequent mailbox with the same name forever.  Unique identifiers
   are assigned in a strictly ascending fashion in the mailbox; as each
   message is added to the mailbox it is assigned a higher UID than the
   message(s) which were added previously.  Unlike message sequence
   numbers, unique identifiers are not necessarily contiguous.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The unique identifier of a message MUST NOT change during the
   session, and SHOULD NOT change between sessions.  Any change of
   unique identifiers between sessions MUST be detectable using the
   UIDVALIDITY mechanism discussed below.  Persistent unique identifiers
   are required for a client to resynchronize its state from a previous
   session with the server (e.g., disconnected or offline access
   clients); this is discussed further in [IMAP-DISC].
   Associated with every mailbox are two values which aid in unique
   identifier handling: the next unique identifier value and the unique
   identifier validity value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The next unique identifier value is the predicted value that will be
   assigned to a new message in the mailbox.  Unless the unique
   identifier validity also changes (see below), the next unique
   identifier value MUST have the following two characteristics.  First,
   the next unique identifier value MUST NOT change unless new messages
   are added to the mailbox; and second, the next unique identifier
   value MUST change whenever new messages are added to the mailbox,
   even if those new messages are subsequently expunged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: The next unique identifier value is intended to
        provide a means for a client to determine whether any
        messages have been delivered to the mailbox since the
        previous time it checked this value.  It is not intended to
        provide any guarantee that any message will have this
        unique identifier.  A client can only assume, at the time
        that it obtains the next unique identifier value, that
        messages arriving after that time will have a UID greater
        than or equal to that value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The unique identifier validity value is sent in a UIDVALIDITY
   response code in an OK untagged response at mailbox selection time.
   If unique identifiers from an earlier session fail to persist in this
   session, the unique identifier validity value MUST be greater than
   the one used in the earlier session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: Ideally, unique identifiers SHOULD persist at all
        times.  Although this specification recognizes that failure
        to persist can be unavoidable in certain server
        environments, it STRONGLY ENCOURAGES message store
        implementation techniques that avoid this problem.  For
        example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         1) Unique identifiers MUST be strictly ascending in the
            mailbox at all times.  If the physical message store is
            re-ordered by a non-IMAP agent, this requires that the
            unique identifiers in the mailbox be regenerated, since
            the former unique identifiers are no longer strictly
            ascending as a result of the re-ordering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         2) If the message store has no mechanism to store unique
            identifiers, it must regenerate unique identifiers at
            each session, and each session must have a unique
            UIDVALIDITY value.
         3) If the mailbox is deleted and a new mailbox with the
            same name is created at a later date, the server must
            either keep track of unique identifiers from the
            previous instance of the mailbox, or it must assign a
            new UIDVALIDITY value to the new instance of the
            mailbox.  A good UIDVALIDITY value to use in this case
            is a 32-bit representation of the creation date/time of
            the mailbox.  It is alright to use a constant such as
            1, but only if it guaranteed that unique identifiers
            will never be reused, even in the case of a mailbox
            being deleted (or renamed) and a new mailbox by the
            same name created at some future time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         4) The combination of mailbox name, UIDVALIDITY, and UID
            must refer to a single immutable message on that server
            forever.  In particular, the internal date, [RFC-2822]
            size, envelope, body structure, and message texts
            (RFC822, RFC822.HEADER, RFC822.TEXT, and all BODY[...]

            include message numbers, nor does it include attributes

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
<a name="section-2.3.1.2"><h4>2.3.1.2         Message Sequence Number Message Attribute</h4></a>
                    

   A relative position from 1 to the number of messages in the mailbox.
   This position MUST be ordered by ascending unique identifier.  As
   each new message is added, it is assigned a message sequence number
   that is 1 higher than the number of messages in the mailbox before
   that new message was added.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Message sequence numbers can be reassigned during the session.  For
   example, when a message is permanently removed (expunged) from the
   mailbox, the message sequence number for all subsequent messages is
   decremented.  The number of messages in the mailbox is also
   decremented.  Similarly, a new message can be assigned a message
   sequence number that was once held by some other message prior to an
   expunge.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to accessing messages by relative position in the

   messages have arrived with message sequence numbers of 9, 10, and 11.
   Another example, if message 287 in a 523 message mailbox has UID

   A list of zero or more named tokens associated with the message.  A
   flag is set by its addition to this list, and is cleared by its
   removal.  There are two types of flags in IMAP4rev1.  A flag of
   either type can be permanent or session-only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A system flag is a flag name that is pre-defined in this
   specification.  All system flags begin with "\".  Certain system
   flags (\Deleted and \Seen) have special semantics described
   elsewhere.  The currently-defined system flags are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        \Seen
           Message has been read

        \Answered
           Message has been answered

        \Flagged
           Message is "flagged" for urgent/special attention

        \Deleted
           Message is "deleted" for removal by later EXPUNGE

        \Draft
           Message has not completed composition (marked as a draft).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        \Recent
           Message is "recently" arrived in this mailbox.  This session
           is the first session to have been notified about this
           message; if the session is read-write, subsequent sessions
           will not see \Recent set for this message.  This flag can not
           be altered by the client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           If it is not possible to determine whether or not this
           session is the first session to be notified about a message,
           then that message SHOULD be considered recent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           If multiple connections have the same mailbox selected
           simultaneously, it is undefined which of these connections
           will see newly-arrived messages with \Recent set and which
           will see it without \Recent set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A keyword is defined by the server implementation.  Keywords do not
   begin with "\".  Servers MAY permit the client to define new keywords
   in the mailbox (see the description of the PERMANENTFLAGS response
   code for more information).
   A flag can be permanent or session-only on a per-flag basis.
   Permanent flags are those which the client can add or remove from the
   message flags permanently; that is, concurrent and subsequent
   sessions will see any change in permanent flags.  Changes to session
   flags are valid only in that session.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: The \Recent system flag is a special case of a
        session flag.  \Recent can not be used as an argument in a

        all.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3.3"><h4>2.3.3   Internal Date Message Attribute</h4></a>

   The internal date and time of the message on the server.  This
   is not the date and time in the [RFC-2822] header, but rather a

   the case of messages delivered via [SMTP], this SHOULD be the
   date and time of final delivery of the message as defined by
   [SMTP].  In the case of messages delivered by the IMAP4rev1 COPY

   In addition to being able to fetch the full [RFC-2822] text of a
   message, IMAP4rev1 permits the fetching of portions of the full
   message text.  Specifically, it is possible to fetch the
   [RFC-2822] message header, [RFC-2822] message body, a [MIME-IMB]
   body part, or a [MIME-IMB] header.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.       State and Flow Diagram</h2></a>

   Once the connection between client and server is established, an
   IMAP4rev1 connection is in one of four states.  The initial
   state is identified in the server greeting.  Most commands are
   only valid in certain states.  It is a protocol error for the
   client to attempt a command while the connection is in an
   inappropriate state, and the server will respond with a BAD or
   NO (depending upon server implementation) command completion
   result.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1     Not Authenticated State</h3></a>

   In the not authenticated state, the client MUST supply
   authentication credentials before most commands will be
   permitted.  This state is entered when a connection starts
   unless the connection has been pre-authenticated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2     Authenticated State</h3></a>

   In the authenticated state, the client is authenticated and MUST
   select a mailbox to access before commands that affect messages
   will be permitted.  This state is entered when a
   pre-authenticated connection starts, when acceptable
   authentication credentials have been provided, after an error in
   selecting a mailbox, or after a successful CLOSE command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3     Selected State</h3></a>

   In a selected state, a mailbox has been selected to access.
   This state is entered when a mailbox has been successfully
   selected.
	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4     Logout State</h3></a>

   In the logout state, the connection is being terminated.  This
   state can be entered as a result of a client request (via the
   LOGOUT command) or by unilateral action on the part of either
   the client or server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the client requests the logout state, the server MUST send an
   untagged BYE response and a tagged OK response to the LOGOUT
   command before the server closes the connection; and the client
   MUST read the tagged OK response to the LOGOUT command before
   the client closes the connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A server MUST NOT unilaterally close the connection without
   sending an untagged BYE response that contains the reason for
   having done so.  A client SHOULD NOT unilaterally close the
   connection, and instead SHOULD issue a LOGOUT command.  If the
   server detects that the client has unilaterally closed the
   connection, the server MAY omit the untagged BYE response and

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.       Data Formats</h2></a>

   IMAP4rev1 uses textual commands and responses.  Data in
   IMAP4rev1 can be in one of several forms: atom, number, string,
   parenthesized list, or NIL.  Note that a particular data item
   may take more than one form; for example, a data item defined as
   using "astring" syntax may be either an atom or a string.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1     Atom</h3></a>

   An atom consists of one or more non-special characters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2     Number</h3></a>

   A number consists of one or more digit characters, and
   represents a numeric value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3     String</h3></a>

   A string is in one of two forms: either literal or quoted
   string.  The literal form is the general form of string.  The
   quoted string form is an alternative that avoids the overhead of
   processing a literal at the cost of limitations of characters
   which may be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A literal is a sequence of zero or more octets (including CR and
   LF), prefix-quoted with an octet count in the form of an open
   brace ("{"), the number of octets, close brace ("}"), and CRLF.
   In the case of literals transmitted from server to client, the
   CRLF is immediately followed by the octet data.  In the case of
   literals transmitted from client to server, the client MUST wait
   to receive a command continuation request (described later in
   this document) before sending the octet data (and the remainder
   of the command).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A quoted string is a sequence of zero or more 7-bit characters,
   excluding CR and LF, with double quote (<">) characters at each
   end.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The empty string is represented as either "" (a quoted string
   with zero characters between double quotes) or as {0} followed
   by CRLF (a literal with an octet count of 0).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Note: Even if the octet count is 0, a client transmitting a
     literal MUST wait to receive a command continuation request.
	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   8-bit and Binary Strings</h4></a>

   8-bit textual and binary mail is supported through the use of a
   [MIME-IMB] content transfer encoding.  IMAP4rev1 implementations MAY
   transmit 8-bit or multi-octet characters in literals, but SHOULD do
   so only when the [CHARSET] is identified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although a BINARY body encoding is defined, unencoded binary strings
   are not permitted.  A "binary string" is any string with NUL
   characters.  Implementations MUST encode binary data into a textual
   form, such as BASE64, before transmitting the data.  A string with an
   excessive amount of CTL characters MAY also be considered to be
   binary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4     Parenthesized List</h3></a>

   Data structures are represented as a "parenthesized list"; a sequence
   of data items, delimited by space, and bounded at each end by
   parentheses.  A parenthesized list can contain other parenthesized
   lists, using multiple levels of parentheses to indicate nesting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The empty list is represented as () -- a parenthesized list with no
   members.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5     NIL</h3></a>

   The special form "NIL" represents the non-existence of a particular
   data item that is represented as a string or parenthesized list, as
   distinct from the empty string "" or the empty parenthesized list ().

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: NIL is never used for any data item which takes the
        form of an atom.  For example, a mailbox name of "NIL" is a
        mailbox named NIL as opposed to a non-existent mailbox
        name.  This is because mailbox uses "astring" syntax which
        is an atom or a string.  Conversely, an addr-name of NIL is
        a non-existent personal name, because addr-name uses
        "nstring" syntax which is NIL or a string, but never an
        atom.
	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.       Operational Considerations</h2></a>

   The following rules are listed here to ensure that all IMAP4rev1
   implementations interoperate properly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1     Mailbox Naming</h3></a>

   Mailbox names are 7-bit.  Client implementations MUST NOT attempt to
   create 8-bit mailbox names, and SHOULD interpret any 8-bit mailbox
   names returned by LIST or LSUB as UTF-8.  Server implementations
   SHOULD prohibit the creation of 8-bit mailbox names, and SHOULD NOT
   return 8-bit mailbox names in LIST or LSUB.  See section 5.1.3 for
   more information on how to represent non-ASCII mailbox names.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: 8-bit mailbox names were undefined in earlier
        versions of this protocol.  Some sites used a local 8-bit
        character set to represent non-ASCII mailbox names.  Such
        usage is not interoperable, and is now formally deprecated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The case-insensitive mailbox name INBOX is a special name reserved to
   mean "the primary mailbox for this user on this server".  The
   interpretation of all other names is implementation-dependent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In particular, this specification takes no position on case
   sensitivity in non-INBOX mailbox names.  Some server implementations
   are fully case-sensitive; others preserve case of a newly-created
   name but otherwise are case-insensitive; and yet others coerce names
   to a particular case.  Client implementations MUST interact with any
   of these.  If a server implementation interprets non-INBOX mailbox
   names as case-insensitive, it MUST treat names using the
   international naming convention specially as described in section
   5.1.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are certain client considerations when creating a new mailbox
   name:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1)    Any character which is one of the atom-specials (see the Formal
         Syntax) will require that the mailbox name be represented as a
         quoted string or literal.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2)    CTL and other non-graphic characters are difficult to represent
         in a user interface and are best avoided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3)    Although the list-wildcard characters ("%" and "*") are valid
         in a mailbox name, it is difficult to use such mailbox names
         with the LIST and LSUB commands due to the conflict with
         wildcard interpretation.
   4)    Usually, a character (determined by the server implementation)
         is reserved to delimit levels of hierarchy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5)    Two characters, "#" and "&", have meanings by convention, and
         should be avoided except when used in that convention.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1   Mailbox Hierarchy Naming</h4></a>

   If it is desired to export hierarchical mailbox names, mailbox names
   MUST be left-to-right hierarchical using a single character to
   separate levels of hierarchy.  The same hierarchy separator character
   is used for all levels of hierarchy within a single name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.2"><h4>5.1.2   Mailbox Namespace Naming Convention</h4></a>

   By convention, the first hierarchical element of any mailbox name
   which begins with "#" identifies the "namespace" of the remainder of
   the name.  This makes it possible to disambiguate between different
   types of mailbox stores, each of which have their own namespaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        For example, implementations which offer access to USENET
        newsgroups MAY use the "#news" namespace to partition the
        USENET newsgroup namespace from that of other mailboxes.
        Thus, the comp.mail.misc newsgroup would have a mailbox
        name of "#news.comp.mail.misc", and the name
        "comp.mail.misc" can refer to a different object (e.g., a
        user's private mailbox).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.3"><h4>5.1.3   Mailbox International Naming Convention</h4></a>

   By convention, international mailbox names in IMAP4rev1 are specified
   using a modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in [UTF-7].
   Modified UTF-7 may also be usable in servers that implement an
   earlier version of this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters, except for "&",
   represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
   and 0x27-0x7e.  The character "&" (0x26) is represented by the
   two-octet sequence "&-".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f and 0x7f-0xff) are
   represented in modified BASE64, with a further modification from
   [UTF-7] that "," is used instead of "/".  Modified BASE64 MUST NOT be
   used to represent any printing US-ASCII character which can represent
   itself.
   "&" is used to shift to modified BASE64 and "-" to shift back to
   US-ASCII.  There is no implicit shift from BASE64 to US-ASCII, and
   null shifts ("-&" while in BASE64; note that "&-" while in US-ASCII
   means "&") are not permitted.  However, all names start in US-ASCII,
   and MUST end in US-ASCII; that is, a name that ends with a non-ASCII
   ISO-10646 character MUST end with a "-").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The purpose of these modifications is to correct the following
   problems with UTF-7:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1) UTF-7 uses the "+" character for shifting; this conflicts with
         the common use of "+" in mailbox names, in particular USENET

   At any time, a server can send data that the client did not request.
   Sometimes, such behavior is REQUIRED.  For example, agents other than
   the server MAY add messages to the mailbox (e.g., new message
   delivery), change the flags of the messages in the mailbox (e.g.,
   simultaneous access to the same mailbox by multiple agents), or even
   remove messages from the mailbox.  A server MUST send mailbox size
   updates automatically if a mailbox size change is observed during the
   processing of a command.  A server SHOULD send message flag updates
   automatically, without requiring the client to request such updates
   explicitly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Special rules exist for server notification of a client about the
   removal of messages to prevent synchronization errors; see the
   description of the EXPUNGE response for more detail.  In particular,
   it is NOT permitted to send an EXISTS response that would reduce the
   number of messages in the mailbox; only the EXPUNGE response can do
   this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Regardless of what implementation decisions a client makes on
   remembering data from the server, a client implementation MUST record
   mailbox size updates.  It MUST NOT assume that any command after the
   initial mailbox selection will return the size of the mailbox.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3     Response when no Command in Progress</h3></a>

   Server implementations are permitted to send an untagged response
   (except for EXPUNGE) while there is no command in progress.  Server
   implementations that send such responses MUST deal with flow control
   considerations.  Specifically, they MUST either (1) verify that the<br>
   size of the data does not exceed the underlying transport's available
   window size, or (2) use non-blocking writes.<br>
	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4     Autologout Timer</h3></a>

   If a server has an inactivity autologout timer, the duration of that
   timer MUST be at least 30 minutes.  The receipt of ANY command from
   the client during that interval SHOULD suffice to reset the
   autologout timer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5     Multiple Commands in Progress</h3></a>

   The client MAY send another command without waiting for the
   completion result response of a command, subject to ambiguity rules
   (see below) and flow control constraints on the underlying data
   stream.  Similarly, a server MAY begin processing another command
   before processing the current command to completion, subject to
   ambiguity rules.  However, any command continuation request responses
   and command continuations MUST be negotiated before any subsequent
   command is initiated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The exception is if an ambiguity would result because of a command
   that would affect the results of other commands.  Clients MUST NOT
   send multiple commands without waiting if an ambiguity would result.
   If the server detects a possible ambiguity, it MUST execute commands
   to completion in the order given by the client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The most obvious example of ambiguity is when a command would affect
   the results of another command, e.g., a FETCH of a message's flags
   and a STORE of that same message's flags.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A non-obvious ambiguity occurs with commands that permit an untagged
   EXPUNGE response (commands other than FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH),
   since an untagged EXPUNGE response can invalidate sequence numbers in
   a subsequent command.  This is not a problem for FETCH, STORE, or
   SEARCH commands because servers are prohibited from sending EXPUNGE
   responses while any of those commands are in progress.  Therefore, if
   the client sends any command other than FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH, it
   MUST wait for the completion result response before sending a command
   with message sequence numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Note: UID FETCH, UID STORE, and UID SEARCH are different
        commands from FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH.  If the client
        sends a UID command, it must wait for a completion result
        response before sending a command with message sequence
        numbers.
   For example, the following non-waiting command sequences are invalid:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      FETCH + NOOP + STORE
      STORE + COPY + FETCH

      CHECK + FETCH

   The following are examples of valid non-waiting command sequences:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      FETCH + STORE + SEARCH + CHECK
      STORE + COPY + EXPUNGE

      UID SEARCH + UID SEARCH may be valid or invalid as a non-waiting

   In the not authenticated state, the AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command
   establishes authentication and enters the authenticated state.  The
   AUTHENTICATE command provides a general mechanism for a variety of
   authentication techniques, privacy protection, and integrity
   checking; whereas the LOGIN command uses a traditional user name and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Server implementations MAY allow access to certain mailboxes without

      A [TLS] negotiation begins immediately after the CRLF at the end

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The server remains in the non-authenticated state, even if client

      The AUTHENTICATE command indicates a [SASL] authentication
      mechanism to the server.  If the server supports the requested
      authentication mechanism, it performs an authentication protocol
      exchange to authenticate and identify the client.  It MAY also
      negotiate an OPTIONAL security layer for subsequent protocol
      interactions.  If the requested authentication mechanism is not
      supported, the server SHOULD reject the AUTHENTICATE command by
      sending a tagged NO response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The AUTHENTICATE command does not support the optional "initial
      response" feature of [SASL].  Section 5.1 of [SASL] specifies how
      to handle an authentication mechanism which uses an initial

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The service name specified by this protocol's profile of [SASL] is

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of

      authentication mechanism.  A server challenge consists of a
      command continuation request response with the "+" token followed
      by a BASE64 encoded string.  The client response consists of a
      single line consisting of a BASE64 encoded string.  If the client
      wishes to cancel an authentication exchange, it issues a line
      consisting of a single "*".  If the server receives such a

           password mechanisms, unless either the STARTTLS command
           has been negotiated or some other mechanism that
           protects the session from password snooping has been
           provided.  Server sites SHOULD NOT use any configuration

           Client and server implementations SHOULD implement
           additional [SASL] mechanisms that do not use plaintext
           passwords, such the GSSAPI mechanism described in [SASL]
           and/or the [DIGEST-MD5] mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Servers and clients can support multiple authentication
      mechanisms.  The server SHOULD list its supported authentication
      mechanisms in the response to the CAPABILITY command so that the
      client knows which authentication mechanisms to use.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A server MAY include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK
      response of a successful AUTHENTICATE command in order to send

      automatic capabilities.  This should only be done if a security
      layer was not negotiated by the AUTHENTICATE command, because the
      tagged OK response as part of an AUTHENTICATE command is not

      the plaintext password authenticating this user.
      A server MAY include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK
      response to a successful LOGIN command in order to send
      capabilities automatically.  It is unnecessary for a client to
      send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these
      automatic capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:    C: a001 LOGIN SMITH SESAME
               S: a001 OK LOGIN completed

        Note: Use of the LOGIN command over an insecure network
        (such as the Internet) is a security risk, because anyone
        monitoring network traffic can obtain plaintext passwords.
        The LOGIN command SHOULD NOT be used except as a last
        resort, and it is recommended that client implementations
        have a means to disable any automatic use of the LOGIN
        command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Unless either the STARTTLS command has been negotiated or
        some other mechanism that protects the session from
        password snooping has been provided, a server
        implementation MUST implement a configuration in which it
        advertises the LOGINDISABLED capability and does NOT permit
        the LOGIN command.  Server sites SHOULD NOT use any
        configuration which permits the LOGIN command without such
        a protection mechanism against password snooping.  A client
        implementation MUST NOT send a LOGIN command if the
        LOGINDISABLED capability is advertised.

      The SELECT command selects a mailbox so that messages in the
      mailbox can be accessed.  Before returning an OK to the client,
      the server MUST send the following untagged data to the client.
      Note that earlier versions of this protocol only required the
      FLAGS, EXISTS, and RECENT untagged data; consequently, client
      implementations SHOULD implement default behavior for missing data
      as discussed with the individual item.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Only one mailbox can be selected at a time in a connection;
      simultaneous access to multiple mailboxes requires multiple

      The CREATE command creates a mailbox with the given name.  An OK

      created.  It is an error to attempt to create INBOX or a mailbox
      with a name that refers to an extant mailbox.  Any error in
      creation will return a tagged NO response.
      If the mailbox name is suffixed with the server's hierarchy
      separator character (as returned from the server by a LIST
      command), this is a declaration that the client intends to create
      mailbox names under this name in the hierarchy.  Server
      implementations that do not require this declaration MUST ignore
      the declaration.  In any case, the name created is without the
      trailing hierarchy delimiter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the server's hierarchy separator character appears elsewhere in
      the name, the server SHOULD create any superior hierarchical names
      that are needed for the CREATE command to be successfully

      a server in which "/" is the hierarchy separator character SHOULD
      create foo/ and foo/bar/ if they do not already exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If a new mailbox is created with the same name as a mailbox which
      was deleted, its unique identifiers MUST be greater than any
      unique identifiers used in the previous incarnation of the mailbox

      An empty ("" string) reference name argument indicates that the

      string if the reference is non-rooted or is an empty string.  In
      all cases, a hierarchy delimiter (or NIL if there is no hierarchy)
      is returned.  This permits a client to get the hierarchy delimiter

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The reference and mailbox name arguments are interpreted into a

           Note: The interpretation of the reference argument is
           implementation-defined.  It depends upon whether the
           server implementation has a concept of the "current

           working directory, and the mailbox name argument would
           contain the name as interpreted in the current working
           directory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           If a server implementation has no concept of break out
           characters, the canonical form is normally the reference
           name appended with the mailbox name.  Note that if the
           server implements the namespace convention (section
           5.1.2), "#" is a break out character and must be treated
           as such.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           If the reference argument is not a level of mailbox
           hierarchy (that is, it is a \NoInferiors name), and/or
           the reference argument does not end with the hierarchy
           delimiter, it is implementation-dependent how this is
           interpreted.  For example, a reference of "foo/bar" and
           mailbox name of "rag/baz" could be interpreted as
           "foo/bar/rag/baz", "foo/barrag/baz", or "foo/rag/baz".
           A client SHOULD NOT use such a reference argument except
           at the explicit request of the user.  A hierarchical
           browser MUST NOT make any assumptions about server
           interpretation of the reference unless the reference is
           a level of mailbox hierarchy AND ends with the hierarchy
           delimiter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Any part of the reference argument that is included in the
      interpreted form SHOULD prefix the interpreted form.  It SHOULD
      also be in the same form as the reference name argument.  This
      rule permits the client to determine if the returned mailbox name
      is in the context of the reference argument, or if something about
      the mailbox argument overrode the reference argument.  Without
      this rule, the client would have to have knowledge of the server's
      naming semantics including what characters are "breakouts" that
      override a naming context.
           For example, here are some examples of how references
           and mailbox names might be interpreted on a UNIX-based
           server:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">               Reference     Mailbox Name  Interpretation
               ------------  ------------  --------------
               ~smith/Mail/  foo.*         ~smith/Mail/foo.*
               archive/      %             archive/%
               #news.        comp.mail.*   #news.comp.mail.*
               ~smith/Mail/  /usr/doc/foo  /usr/doc/foo
               archive/      ~fred/Mail/*  ~fred/Mail/*

           The first three examples demonstrate interpretations in
           the context of the reference argument.  Note that
           "~smith/Mail" SHOULD NOT be transformed into something
           like "/u2/users/smith/Mail", or it would be impossible
           for the client to determine that the interpretation was
           in the context of the reference.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The character "*" is a wildcard, and matches zero or more
      characters at this position.  The character "%" is similar to "*",
      but it does not match a hierarchy delimiter.  If the "%" wildcard
      is the last character of a mailbox name argument, matching levels
      of hierarchy are also returned.  If these levels of hierarchy are
      not also selectable mailboxes, they are returned with the
      \Noselect mailbox name attribute (see the description of the LIST
      response for more details).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Server implementations are permitted to "hide" otherwise
      accessible mailboxes from the wildcard characters, by preventing
      certain characters or names from matching a wildcard in certain
      situations.  For example, a UNIX-based server might restrict the
      interpretation of "*" so that an initial "/" character does not
      match.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The special name INBOX is included in the output from LIST, if
      INBOX is supported by this server for this user and if the

      criteria for omitting INBOX is whether SELECT INBOX will return
      failure; it is not relevant whether the user's real INBOX resides

      The STATUS command requests the status of the indicated mailbox.
      It does not change the currently selected mailbox, nor does it

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The STATUS command provides an alternative to opening a second

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command is not guaranteed to

      quite slow.  In some implementations, the server is obliged to
      open the mailbox read-only internally to obtain certain status
      information.  Also unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command
      does not accept wildcards.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Note: The STATUS command is intended to access the
           status of mailboxes other than the currently selected
           mailbox.  Because the STATUS command can cause the
           mailbox to be opened internally, and because this
           information is available by other means on the selected
           mailbox, the STATUS command SHOULD NOT be used on the
           currently selected mailbox.
           The STATUS command MUST NOT be used as a "check for new
           messages in the selected mailbox" operation (refer to

      The APPEND command appends the literal argument as a new message

      SHOULD be in the format of an [RFC-2822] message.  8-bit
      characters are permitted in the message.  A server implementation
      that is unable to preserve 8-bit data properly MUST be able to

      content transfer encoding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Note: There MAY be exceptions, e.g., draft messages, in

      restored to its state before the APPEND attempt; no partial
      appending is permitted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If the destination mailbox does not exist, a server MUST return an

      the text of the tagged NO response.  This gives a hint to the
      client that it can attempt a CREATE command and retry the APPEND
      if the CREATE is successful.
      If the mailbox is currently selected, the normal new message
      actions SHOULD occur.  Specifically, the server SHOULD notify the
      client immediately via an untagged EXISTS response.  If the server

         It is possible to fetch a substring of the designated text.
         This is done by appending an open angle bracket ("<"), the

         maximum number of octets desired, and a close angle bracket
         (">") to the part specifier.  If the starting octet is beyond
         the end of the text, an empty string is returned.
         Any partial fetch that attempts to read beyond the end of the
         text is truncated as appropriate.  A partial fetch that starts
         at octet 0 is returned as a partial fetch, even if this

	<a name="section-6.4.8"><h4>6.4.8   UID Command</h4></a>

   Arguments:  command name
               command arguments

   Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH, SEARCH

   Result:     OK - UID command completed
               NO - UID command error
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The UID command has two forms.  In the first form, it takes as its
      arguments a COPY, FETCH, or STORE command with arguments
      appropriate for the associated command.  However, the numbers in
      the sequence set argument are unique identifiers instead of
      message sequence numbers.  Sequence set ranges are permitted, but
      there is no guarantee that unique identifiers will be contiguous.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A non-existent unique identifier is ignored without any error
      message generated.  Thus, it is possible for a UID FETCH command
      to return an OK without any data or a UID COPY or UID STORE to
      return an OK without performing any operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In the second form, the UID command takes a SEARCH command with
      SEARCH command arguments.  The interpretation of the arguments is
      the same as with SEARCH; however, the numbers returned in a SEARCH
      response for a UID SEARCH command are unique identifiers instead
      of message sequence numbers.  For example, the command UID SEARCH
      1:100 UID 443:557 returns the unique identifiers corresponding to
      the intersection of two sequence sets, the message sequence number
      range 1:100 and the UID range 443:557.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Note: in the above example, the UID range 443:557
           appears.  The same comment about a non-existent unique
           identifier being ignored without any error message also
           applies here.  Hence, even if neither UID 443 or 557
           exist, this range is valid and would include an existing
           UID 495.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Also note that a UID range of 559:* always includes the
           UID of the last message in the mailbox, even if 559 is
           higher than any assigned UID value.  This is because the
           contents of a range are independent of the order of the
           range endpoints.  Thus, any UID range with * as one of
           the endpoints indicates at least one message (the
           message with the highest numbered UID), unless the
           mailbox is empty.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The number after the "*" in an untagged FETCH response is always a
      message sequence number, not a unique identifier, even for a UID
      command response.  However, server implementations MUST implicitly
      include the UID message data item as part of any FETCH response
      caused by a UID command, regardless of whether a UID was specified
      as a message data item to the FETCH.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">
      Note: The rule about including the UID message data item as part
      of a FETCH response primarily applies to the UID FETCH and UID
      STORE commands, including a UID FETCH command that does not
      include UID as a message data item.  Although it is unlikely that
      the other UID commands will cause an untagged FETCH, this rule
      applies to these commands as well.

   precise syntax of server responses is described in the Formal Syntax
   section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client MUST be prepared to accept any response at all times.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Status responses can be tagged or untagged.  Tagged status responses
   indicate the completion result (OK, NO, or BAD status) of a client
   command, and have a tag matching the command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some status responses, and all server data, are untagged.  An
   untagged response is indicated by the token "*" instead of a tag.
   Untagged status responses indicate server greeting, or server status
   that does not indicate the completion of a command (for example, an
   impending system shutdown alert).  For historical reasons, untagged
   server data responses are also called "unsolicited data", although
   strictly speaking, only unilateral server data is truly
   "unsolicited".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Certain server data MUST be recorded by the client when it is
   received; this is noted in the description of that data.  Such data
   conveys critical information which affects the interpretation of all
   subsequent commands and responses (e.g., updates reflecting the
   creation or destruction of messages).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other server data SHOULD be recorded for later reference; if the
   client does not need to record the data, or if recording the data has
   no obvious purpose (e.g., a SEARCH response when no SEARCH command is
   in progress), the data SHOULD be ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example of unilateral untagged server data occurs when the IMAP
   connection is in the selected state.  In the selected state, the
   server checks the mailbox for new messages as part of command
   execution.  Normally, this is part of the execution of every command;
   hence, a NOOP command suffices to check for new messages.  If new
   messages are found, the server sends untagged EXISTS and RECENT
   responses reflecting the new size of the mailbox.  Server
   implementations that offer multiple simultaneous access to the same
   mailbox SHOULD also send appropriate unilateral untagged FETCH and
   EXPUNGE responses if another agent changes the state of any message
   flags or expunges any messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Command continuation request responses use the token "+" instead of a
   tag.  These responses are sent by the server to indicate acceptance
   of an incomplete client command and readiness for the remainder of
   the command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1     Server Responses - Status Responses</h3></a>

   Status responses are OK, NO, BAD, PREAUTH and BYE.  OK, NO, and BAD
   can be tagged or untagged.  PREAUTH and BYE are always untagged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Status responses MAY include an OPTIONAL "response code".  A response
   code consists of data inside square brackets in the form of an atom,
   possibly followed by a space and arguments.  The response code
   contains additional information or status codes for client software
   beyond the OK/NO/BAD condition, and are defined when there is a
   specific action that a client can take based upon the additional
   information.
   The currently defined response codes are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ALERT

         The human-readable text contains a special alert that MUST be
         presented to the user in a fashion that calls the user's
         attention to the message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      BADCHARSET

         Optionally followed by a parenthesized list of charsets.  A
         SEARCH failed because the given charset is not supported by
         this implementation.  If the optional list of charsets is
         given, this lists the charsets that are supported by this
         implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      CAPABILITY

         Followed by a list of capabilities.  This can appear in the
         initial OK or PREAUTH response to transmit an initial
         capabilities list.  This makes it unnecessary for a client to
         send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes this
         response.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      PARSE

         The human-readable text represents an error in parsing the
         [RFC-2822] header or [MIME-IMB] headers of a message in the
         mailbox.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      PERMANENTFLAGS

         Followed by a parenthesized list of flags, indicates which of
         the known flags the client can change permanently.  Any flags
         that are in the FLAGS untagged response, but not the
         PERMANENTFLAGS list, can not be set permanently.  If the client
         attempts to STORE a flag that is not in the PERMANENTFLAGS
         list, the server will either ignore the change or store the
         state change for the remainder of the current session only.
         The PERMANENTFLAGS list can also include the special flag \*,
         which indicates that it is possible to create new keywords by
         attempting to store those flags in the mailbox.
      READ-ONLY

         The mailbox is selected read-only, or its access while selected
         has changed from read-write to read-only.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      READ-WRITE

         The mailbox is selected read-write, or its access while
         selected has changed from read-only to read-write.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TRYCREATE

         An APPEND or COPY attempt is failing because the target mailbox
         does not exist (as opposed to some other reason).  This is a
         hint to the client that the operation can succeed if the
         mailbox is first created by the CREATE command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      UIDNEXT

         Followed by a decimal number, indicates the next unique
         identifier value.  Refer to section 2.3.1.1 for more
         information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      UIDVALIDITY

         Followed by a decimal number, indicates the unique identifier
         validity value.  Refer to section 2.3.1.1 for more information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      UNSEEN

         Followed by a decimal number, indicates the number of the first
         message without the \Seen flag set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Additional response codes defined by particular client or server
      implementations SHOULD be prefixed with an "X" until they are
      added to a revision of this protocol.  Client implementations
      SHOULD ignore response codes that they do not recognize.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1.1"><h4>7.1.1   OK Response</h4></a>

   Contents:   OPTIONAL response code
               human-readable text

      The OK response indicates an information message from the server.
      When tagged, it indicates successful completion of the associated
      command.  The human-readable text MAY be presented to the user as
      an information message.  The untagged form indicates an
      information-only message; the nature of the information MAY be
      indicated by a response code.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The untagged form is also used as one of three possible greetings
      at connection startup.  It indicates that the connection is not
      yet authenticated and that a LOGIN command is needed.

   Contents:   OPTIONAL response code
               human-readable text

      The NO response indicates an operational error message from the
      server.  When tagged, it indicates unsuccessful completion of the
      associated command.  The untagged form indicates a warning; the
      command can still complete successfully.  The human-readable text
      describes the condition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:    C: A222 COPY 1:2 owatagusiam
               S: * NO Disk is 98% full, please delete unnecessary data

	<a name="section-7.1.3"><h4>7.1.3   BAD Response</h4></a>

   Contents:   OPTIONAL response code
               human-readable text

      The BAD response indicates an error message from the server.  When
      tagged, it reports a protocol-level error in the client's command;
      the tag indicates the command that caused the error.  The untagged
      form indicates a protocol-level error for which the associated
      command can not be determined; it can also indicate an internal
      server failure.  The human-readable text describes the condition.
   Example:    C: ...very long command line...
               S: * BAD Command line too long
               C: ...empty line...
               S: * BAD Empty command line

	<a name="section-7.1.4"><h4>7.1.4   PREAUTH Response</h4></a>

   Contents:   OPTIONAL response code
               human-readable text

      The PREAUTH response is always untagged, and is one of three
      possible greetings at connection startup.  It indicates that the
      connection has already been authenticated by external means; thus
      no LOGIN command is needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:    S: * PREAUTH IMAP4rev1 server logged in as Smith


	<a name="section-7.1.5"><h4>7.1.5   BYE Response</h4></a>

   Contents:   OPTIONAL response code
               human-readable text

      The BYE response is always untagged, and indicates that the server
      is about to close the connection.  The human-readable text MAY be
      displayed to the user in a status report by the client.  The BYE
      response is sent under one of four conditions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         1) as part of a normal logout sequence.  The server will close
            the connection after sending the tagged OK response to the
            LOGOUT command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         2) as a panic shutdown announcement.  The server closes the
            connection immediately.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         3) as an announcement of an inactivity autologout.  The server
            closes the connection immediately.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         4) as one of three possible greetings at connection startup,
            indicating that the server is not willing to accept a
            connection from this client.  The server closes the
            connection immediately.
      The difference between a BYE that occurs as part of a normal
      LOGOUT sequence (the first case) and a BYE that occurs because of
      a failure (the other three cases) is that the connection closes
      immediately in the failure case.  In all cases the client SHOULD
      continue to read response data from the server until the
      connection is closed; this will ensure that any pending untagged
      or completion responses are read and processed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:    S: * BYE Autologout; idle for too long

	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2     Server Responses - Server and Mailbox Status</h3></a>

   These responses are always untagged.  This is how server and mailbox
   status data are transmitted from the server to the client.  Many of
   these responses typically result from a command with the same name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2.1"><h4>7.2.1   CAPABILITY Response</h4></a>

   Contents:   capability listing

      The CAPABILITY response occurs as a result of a CAPABILITY
      command.  The capability listing contains a space-separated
      listing of capability names that the server supports.  The
      capability listing MUST include the atom "IMAP4rev1".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In addition, client and server implementations MUST implement the
      STARTTLS, LOGINDISABLED, and AUTH=PLAIN (described in [IMAP-TLS])
      capabilities.  See the Security Considerations section for
      important information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A capability name which begins with "AUTH=" indicates that the
      server supports that particular authentication mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The LOGINDISABLED capability indicates that the LOGIN command is
      disabled, and that the server will respond with a tagged NO
      response to any attempt to use the LOGIN command even if the user
      name and password are valid.  An IMAP client MUST NOT issue the
      LOGIN command if the server advertises the LOGINDISABLED
      capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Other capability names indicate that the server supports an
      extension, revision, or amendment to the IMAP4rev1 protocol.
      Server responses MUST conform to this document until the client
      issues a command that uses the associated capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Capability names MUST either begin with "X" or be standard or
      standards-track IMAP4rev1 extensions, revisions, or amendments
      registered with IANA.  A server MUST NOT offer unregistered or
      non-standard capability names, unless such names are prefixed with
      an "X".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Client implementations SHOULD NOT require any capability name
      other than "IMAP4rev1", and MUST ignore any unknown capability
      names.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A server MAY send capabilities automatically, by using the
      CAPABILITY response code in the initial PREAUTH or OK responses,
      and by sending an updated CAPABILITY response code in the tagged
      OK response as part of a successful authentication.  It is
      unnecessary for a client to send a separate CAPABILITY command if
      it recognizes these automatic capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      \Unmarked
         The mailbox does not contain any additional messages since the

      If it is not feasible for the server to determine whether or not
      the mailbox is "interesting", or if the name is a \Noselect name,
      the server SHOULD NOT send either \Marked or \Unmarked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The hierarchy delimiter is a character used to delimit levels of
      hierarchy in a mailbox name.  A client can use it to create child
      mailboxes, and to search higher or lower levels of naming
      hierarchy.  All children of a top-level hierarchy node MUST use
      the same separator character.  A NIL hierarchy delimiter means
      that no hierarchy exists; the name is a "flat" name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.4.1"><h4>7.4.1   EXPUNGE Response</h4></a>

   Contents:   none

      The EXPUNGE response reports that the specified message sequence
      number has been permanently removed from the mailbox.  The message
      sequence number for each successive message in the mailbox is
      immediately decremented by 1, and this decrement is reflected in
      message sequence numbers in subsequent responses (including other
      untagged EXPUNGE responses).
      The EXPUNGE response also decrements the number of messages in the
      mailbox; it is not necessary to send an EXISTS response with the
      new value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      As a result of the immediate decrement rule, message sequence
      numbers that appear in a set of successive EXPUNGE responses
      depend upon whether the messages are removed starting from lower
      numbers to higher numbers, or from higher numbers to lower
      numbers.  For example, if the last 5 messages in a 9-message
      mailbox are expunged, a "lower to higher" server will send five
      untagged EXPUNGE responses for message sequence number 5, whereas
      a "higher to lower server" will send successive untagged EXPUNGE
      responses for message sequence numbers 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An EXPUNGE response MUST NOT be sent when no command is in
      progress, nor while responding to a FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH
      command.  This rule is necessary to prevent a loss of
      synchronization of message sequence numbers between client and
      server.  A command is not "in progress" until the complete command
      has been received; in particular, a command is not "in progress"
      during the negotiation of command continuation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Note: UID FETCH, UID STORE, and UID SEARCH are different
           commands from FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH.  An EXPUNGE

         part of the body parameter parenthesized list for this section.
         Note that headers (part specifiers HEADER or MIME, or the
         header portion of a MESSAGE/RFC822 part), MUST be 7-bit; 8-bit
         characters are not permitted in headers.  Note also that the
         [RFC-2822] delimiting blank line between the header and the
         body is not affected by header line subsetting; the blank line
         is always included as part of header data, except in the case
         of a message which has no body and no blank line.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         Non-textual data such as binary data MUST be transfer encoded
         into a textual form, such as BASE64, prior to being sent to the

         decode the transfer encoded string.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      BODYSTRUCTURE
         A parenthesized list that describes the [MIME-IMB] body
         structure of a message.  This is computed by the server by
         parsing the [MIME-IMB] header fields, defaulting various fields
         as necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         For example, a simple text message of 48 lines and 2279 octets
         can have a body structure of: ("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET"
         "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 2279 48)

         Multiple parts are indicated by parenthesis nesting.  Instead
         of a body type as the first element of the parenthesized list,
         there is a sequence of one or more nested body structures.  The
         second element of the parenthesized list is the multipart
         subtype (mixed, digest, parallel, alternative, etc.).
         For example, a two part message consisting of a text and a
         BASE64-encoded text attachment can have a body structure of:
         (("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152
         23)("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME" "cc.diff")
         "<960723163407.20117h@cac.washington.edu>" "Compiler diff"
         "BASE64" 4554 73) "MIXED")

         Extension data follows the multipart subtype.  Extension data
         is never returned with the BODY fetch, but can be returned with
         a BODYSTRUCTURE fetch.  Extension data, if present, MUST be in
         the defined order.  The extension data of a multipart body part
         are in the following order:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         body parameter parenthesized list
            A parenthesized list of attribute/value pairs [e.g., ("foo"
            "bar" "baz" "rag") where "bar" is the value of "foo", and
            "rag" is the value of "baz"] as defined in [MIME-IMB].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         body disposition

         A parenthesized list that describes the envelope structure of a

         and message-id fields are strings.  The from, sender, reply-to,

         string.
            Note: some servers may return a NIL envelope member in the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Note: [RFC-2822] requires that all messages have a valid

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Note: [RFC-2822] requires that the In-Reply-To and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Note: [RFC-2822] requires that all messages have a valid

	<a name="section-10"><h2>10.      Author's Note</h2></a>

   This document is a revision or rewrite of earlier documents, and
   supercedes the protocol specification in those documents: RFC 2060,
   RFC 1730, unpublished IMAP2bis.TXT document, RFC 1176, and RFC 1064.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.      Security Considerations</h2></a>

   IMAP4rev1 protocol transactions, including electronic mail data, are
   sent in the clear over the network unless protection from snooping is
   negotiated.  This can be accomplished either by the use of STARTTLS,
   negotiated privacy protection in the AUTHENTICATE command, or some
   other protection mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.1"><h3>11.1    STARTTLS Security Considerations</h3></a>

   The specification of the STARTTLS command and LOGINDISABLED
   capability in this document replaces that in [IMAP-TLS].  [IMAP-TLS]
   remains normative for the PLAIN [SASL] authenticator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IMAP client and server implementations MUST implement the
   TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 [TLS] cipher suite, and SHOULD implement the
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA [TLS] cipher suite.  This is
   important as it assures that any two compliant implementations can be
   configured to interoperate.  All other cipher suites are OPTIONAL.
   Note that this is a change from section 2.1 of [IMAP-TLS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   During the [TLS] negotiation, the client MUST check its understanding
   of the server hostname against the server's identity as presented in
   the server Certificate message, in order to prevent man-in-the-middle
   attacks.  If the match fails, the client SHOULD either ask for
   explicit user confirmation, or terminate the connection and indicate
   that the server's identity is suspect.  Matching is performed
   according to these rules:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        The client MUST use the server hostname it used to open the
        connection as the value to compare against the server name
        as expressed in the server certificate.  The client MUST
        NOT use any form of the server hostname derived from an
        insecure remote source (e.g., insecure DNS lookup).  CNAME
        canonicalization is not done.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present in
        the certificate, it SHOULD be used as the source of the
        server's identity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Matching is case-insensitive.
        A "*" wildcard character MAY be used as the left-most name
        component in the certificate.  For example, *.example.com
        would match a.example.com, foo.example.com, etc. but would
        not match example.com.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        If the certificate contains multiple names (e.g., more than
        one dNSName field), then a match with any one of the fields
        is considered acceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Both the client and server MUST check the result of the STARTTLS
   command and subsequent [TLS] negotiation to see whether acceptable
   authentication or privacy was achieved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-11.2"><h3>11.2    Other Security Considerations</h3></a>

   A server error message for an AUTHENTICATE command which fails due to
   invalid credentials SHOULD NOT detail why the credentials are
   invalid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of the LOGIN command sends passwords in the clear.  This can be
   avoided by using the AUTHENTICATE command with a [SASL] mechanism

      snooping has been provided.
   OR
      (3) The following measures are in place:<br>
