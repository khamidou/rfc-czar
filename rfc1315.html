	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   The Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
   and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212 defines a
   more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with
   the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for the
   Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, an evolution
   of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new operational
   requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access
   to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Objects</h2></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Format of Definitions</h3></a>

   Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [9,10].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Frame Relay Operational Model</h3></a>

   For the purposes of understanding this document, Frame Relay is
   viewed as a multi-access media, not as a group of point-to-point
   connections.  This model proposes that Frame Relay is a single
   interface to the network (physical connection) with many destinations
   or neighbors (virtual connections).  This view enables a network
   manager the ability to group all virtual connections with their
   corresponding physical connection thereby allowing simpler
   diagnostics and trouble shooting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Textual Conventions</h3></a>

   Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this
   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of
   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the
   these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The new data types are Index and DLCI.  Index refers to the range
   1..ifNumber, and is used to establish the correspondence between
   ifEntries and Frame Relay Interfaces.  DLCI refers to the range
   0..DLCINumber, and is used to refer to the valid Data Link Connection
   Indices.  DLCINumber is, by definition, the largest possible DLCI
   value possible under the configured Q.922 Address Format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Structure of MIB</h3></a>

   The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining the Data Link
   Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing the Circuits,
   and a third describing errors.
   During normal operation, Frame Relay virtual circuits will be added,
   deleted and change availability.  The occurrence of such changes is
   of interest to the network manager and therefore, one trap is
   defined, intended to be corollary to the SNMP "Link Up" and "Link
   Down" traps.
