	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Abstract</h2></a>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing ATM-based
   interfaces, devices, networks and services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo replaces RFC 1695 [24].  Changes relative to RFC 1695 are
   summarized in the MIB module's REVISION clause.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Textual Conventions used in this MIB are defined in [6] and [19].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   The SNMP Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   0    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   0    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
        for the purpose of management.  The first version of this
        Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and
        described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC
        1215 [4].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC
        1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   0    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   0    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   0    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   ATM Terminology</h2></a>

   Some basic ATM terminologies are described in this section to
   facilitate defining the ATM managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   VCL/VPL and VCC/VPC</h3></a>

   There are two distinct types of ATM virtual connections: Virtual
   Channel Connections (VCCs) and Virtual Path Connection (VPCs).  As
   shown in Figures 1 and 2, ATM virtual connections consist of
   concatenated series of virtual links which forms a path between two
   end points, with each concatenation occurring at an ATM switch.
   Virtual links of VCCs are called Virtual Channel Links (VCLs).
   Virtual links of VPCs are called Virtual Path Links (VPLs). The VCI
   and VPI fields in the ATM cell header associate each cell of a VCC
   with a particular VCL over a given physical link.  The VPI field in
   the ATM cell header associates each cell of a VPC with a particular
   VPL over a given physical link.  Switches route cells between VCLs
   (or VPLs) via a cross-connect function according to the cells'
   VCI/VPI (or VPI) values.

               Virtual Path Connection


   A single ATM end-system or switch does not support the whole end-to-
   end span of a VCC (or VPC).  Rather, multiple ATM end-systems and/or
   switches each support one piece of the VCC (or VPC).  That is, each
   ATM end-system (or ATM switch) at one end of the VCC/VPC supports its
   end of the VCC/VPC plus the VCL or VPL on its external interface, and
   each switch through which the VCC/VPC passes supports the pair of
   VCLs/VPLs on its external interfaces as well as the cross-connection
   of those VCLs/VPLs. Thus, the end-to-end management of a VCC or VPC
   is achieved only by appropriate management of its individual pieces
   in combination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that for management purposes, an ATM network may be viewed as a
   large distributed switch by hiding all the network's internal
   connectivity as being internal to the distributed switch (as shown in
   Figure 2a).  This model may for example be used for Customer Network
   Management (CNM) purposes.

                switch

   A VCC has a set of traffic characteristics (i.e., bandwidth
   parameters, service category parameters, etc.).  VCLs inherit their
   traffic characteristics from the VCC of which they are a part.  VCCs
   are bi-directional by definition.  However, the traffic parameters in
   the two directions of a connection can be symmetric or asymmetric,
   i.e., the two directions can have the same or different traffic
   flows.  A uni-directional traffic flow across a VCC is achieved by
   assigning a zero bandwidth in one direction.  Note that in addition
   to the bandwidth required by the user traffic flow, bandwidth is also
   required for OAM cell flows, even for the zero-bandwidth direction of
   a uni-directional connection.  These same principles apply to VPCs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   PVC, SVC and Soft PVC</h3></a>

   A Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) is a provisioned VCC or VPC.  A
   Switched Virtual Connection (SVC) is a switched VCC or VPC that is
   set up in real-time via call set-up signaling procedures.  A PVC (or
   an SVC) can be a point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-
   to-multipoint VCC or VPC.  A Soft PVC is a connection of which
   portions are switched, while other portions are permanent (see Figure
   3 and [22]).

	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Traffic Management Parameters</h3></a>

	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1   Traffic Policing and Traffic Shaping Parameters</h4></a>

   In order to allocate resources fairly among different users, some
   networks police traffic at resource access points.  The traffic
   enforcement or policing taken at a UNI is called Usage Parameter
   Control (UPC) and is conceptually activated on an incoming VCL or VPL
   as shown in Figure 4.  The use of the traffic enforcer at the ingress
   of the connection is to make sure that the user traffic does not
   exceed the negotiated traffic parameters such as the peak cell rate
   associated with a specific traffic descriptor type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              ----------             ----------
       UNI    |  ATM   |    NNI      |  ATM   |     UNI

              ----------             ----------


                  Figure 4: An Example of a UPC

   In addition, traffic shaping may be performed on an outgoing VPL or
   VCL at a given ATM interface.  The function of the ATM traffic
   shaper, conceptually either at the source or an egress point of the
   connection, is to smooth the outgoing cell traffic inter-arrival
   time.  If policing or shaping is not performed then the policing or
   shaping algorithm is not activated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2   Cell Loss Priority</h4></a>

   To prioritize traffic during resource congestion, ATM cells are
   assigned one of the two types of Cell Loss Priority (CLP), CLP=0 and
   CLP=1.  ATM cells with CLP=0 have a higher priority in regard to cell
   loss than ATM cells with CLP=1.  Therefore, during resource
   congestions, CLP=1 cells are dropped before any CLP=0 cell is
   dropped.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.3"><h4>3.3.3   QoS Class</h4></a>

   RFC1695 specified that one of a number of Quality of Service (QoS)
   classes is assigned to a VCC or VPC by associating the object
   atmTrafficQoSClass with each VCL or VPL.  However, new insights in
   ATM traffic management have caused this object to be deprecated.
	<a name="section-3.3.4"><h4>3.3.4   Service Category</h4></a>

   Replacing QoS Class, VPLs and VCLs are qualified in terms of their
   service category (atmServiceCategory). When properly configured, VCLs
   (or VPLs) concatenated to form a VCC (or VPC) will all have the same
   service category class as that of the VCC (or VPC).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Max Active and Max Current VPI and VCI Bits</h3></a>

   A manager may wish to configure the maximum number of VPI and VCI
   bits that can be used to identify VPIs and VCIs on a given ATM
   interface.  This value can be less than or equal to the maximum
   number of bits supported by the interface hardware, and is referred
   to in the MIB as the Max Active VPI Bits and Max Active VCI Bits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However, a manager may not be able to configure the Max Active Bits
   on both ends of an ATM link.  For example, the manager may not be
   allowed write access to the peer's MIB, or there may be hardware
   limitations on the peer device.  Therefore, the two ATM devices may
   use ILMI to negotiate "Max Current" VPI and VCI bits, which is the
   maximum number of bits that both interfaces are willing to support.
   This is illustrated in Figure 5. The relationship between the
   different parameters is illustrated in Figure 6.  Note that if ILMI
   negotiation is not supported, then the devices have no choice but to
   use the configured Max Active bits, and assume that it has been
   configured to the same value on both ends of the link.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">

         IF a:  Max Active VPI Bits =  6  (configured)
                Max Current VPI Bits = 6  (negotiated)

         IF b:  Max Active VPI Bits =  8  (configured)
                Max Current VPI Bits = 6  (negotiated)

         IF c:  Max Active VPI Bits =  8  (configured)
                Max Current VPI Bits = 8  (negotiated)

         IF d:  Max Active VPI Bits =  8  (configured)
                Max Current VPI Bits = 8  (negotiated)
         (between IF a and IF b, the minimum of the two configured
          "Max Active VPI Bits" is 6, so both interfaces set their
          "Max Current VPI Bits" to 6.  Since IF c and IF d both
          are configured with "Max Active VPI Bits" of 8, they
          set their "Max Current VPI Bits" to 8.)

   ATM management objects are used to manage ATM interfaces, ATM virtual
   links,  ATM cross-connects, AAL5 entities and AAL5 connections
   supported by ATM hosts, ATM switches and ATM networks.  This section
   provides an overview and background of how to use this MIB and other
   potential MIBs for this purpose.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The purpose of this memo is primarily to manage ATM PVCs.  ATM SVCs
   are also represented by the management information in this MIB.
   However, full management of SVCs may require additional capabilities
   which are beyond the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Background</h3></a>

   In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB modules
   are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and cross-connects.
   Examples include MIB II for general system and interface management
   [16][17], the DS3 or SONET MIBs for management of physical
   interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications that
   make use of ATM, such as SMDS.  These MIB modules are outside the
   scope of this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The current specification of this ATM MIB is based on SNMPv2-SMI.
	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Structure of the MIB</h3></a>

   The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following tables:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         (1) ATM interface configuration table<br>
         (2) ATM interface DS3 PLCP  and TC sublayer tables<br>
         (3) ATM traffic parameter table<br>
         (4) ATM interface virtual link (VPL/VCL) configuration<br>
             tables
         (5) ATM VP/VC cross-connect tables<br>
         (6) AAL5 connection performance statistics table<br>

   Note that, managed objects for activation/deactivation of OAM cell
   flows and ATM traps notifying virtual connection or virtual link
   failures are outside the scope of this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3"><h3>4.3   ATM Interface Configuration Table</h3></a>

   This table contains information on ATM cell layer configuration of
   local ATM interfaces on an ATM device in addition to the information
   on such interfaces contained in the ifTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   ATM Interface DS3 PLCP and TC Layer Tables</h3></a>

   These tables provide performance statistics of the DS3 PLCP and TC
   sublayer of local ATM interfaces on a managed ATM device.  DS3 PLCP
   and TC sublayer are currently used to carry ATM cells respectively
   over DS3 and SONET transmission paths.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   ATM Virtual Link and Cross-Connect Tables</h3></a>

   ATM virtual link and cross-connect tables model bi-directional ATM
   virtual links and ATM cross-connects.  The ATM VP/VC link tables are
   implemented in an ATM host, ATM switch and ATM network.  The ATM

   For the purposes of the sysServices object in the System Group of MIB
   II [16], ATM is a data link layer protocol.  Thus, for ATM switches

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   The Interface Group</h3></a>

   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for

   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing ATM interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [17] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable)
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.  Thus, the ATM cell layer interface is
   represented as an entry in the ifTable.  This entry is concerned with
   the ATM cell layer as a whole, and not with individual virtual
   connections which are managed via the ATM-specific managed objects
   specified in this memo.  The inter-relation of entries in the ifTable
   is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [17].

              For an interface on which signalling is not supported,
              then the interface does not necessarily have an address,

              then ifPhysAddress is its primary address. If the
              interface has no addresses, then ifPhysAddress is an octet

   AAL5 in a switch is modeled as shown in Figure 7 and 8.  AAL5 will be
   managed in a switch for only those virtual connections that carry
   AAL5 and are terminated at the AAL5 entity in the switch.  Note that,
   the virtual channels within the ATM UNIs carrying AAL5 will be
   switched by the ATM switching fabric (termed as ATM Entity in the
   figure) to the virtual channels on a proprietary internal interface
   associated with the AAL5 process (termed as AAL5 Entity in the

   the switch will be modeled using the ifTable through an internal
   (pseudo-ATM) virtual interface and the AAL5 performance management
   per virtual connection will be supported using an additional AAL5
   connection table in the ATM MIB.  The association between the AAL5
   virtual link at the proprietary virtual, internal interface and the
   ATM virtual link at the ATM interface will be derived from the

              If the transmit and receive service categories

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12"><h2>12.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since,
   collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of virtual
   connections in ATM switches or networks and provide information of
   their traffic characteristics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
