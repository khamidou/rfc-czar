</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes the use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) to protect firmware packages, which provide object code for one
   or more hardware module components.  CMS is specified in RFC 3852.  A
   digital signature is used to protect the firmware package from
   undetected modification and to provide data origin authentication.
   Encryption is optionally used to protect the firmware package from
   disclosure, and compression is optionally used to reduce the size of
   the protected firmware package.  A firmware package loading receipt
   can optionally be generated to acknowledge the successful loading of
   a firmware package.  Similarly, a firmware package load error report
   can optionally be generated to convey the failure to load a firmware
   package.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document describes the use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) [CMS] to protect firmware packages.  This document also
   describes the use of CMS for receipts and error reports for firmware
   package loading.  The CMS is a data protection encapsulation syntax
   that makes use of ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88].  The protected firmware
   package can be associated with any particular hardware module;
   however, this specification was written with the requirements of
   cryptographic hardware modules in mind, as these modules have strong
   security requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The firmware package contains object code for one or more
   programmable components that make up the hardware module.  The
   firmware package, which is treated as an opaque binary object, is
   digitally signed.  Optional encryption and compression are also
   supported.  When all three are used, the firmware package is
   compressed, then encrypted, and then signed.  Compression simply
   reduces the size of the firmware package, allowing more efficient
   processing and transmission.  Encryption protects the firmware
   package from disclosure, which allows transmission of sensitive
   firmware packages over insecure links.  The encryption algorithm and
   mode employed may also provide integrity, protecting the firmware
   package from undetected modification.  The encryption protects
   proprietary algorithms, classified algorithms, trade secrets, and
   implementation techniques.  The digital signature protects the
   firmware package from undetected modification and provides data
   origin authentication.  The digital signature allows the hardware
   module to confirm that the firmware package comes from an acceptable
   source.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If encryption is used, the firmware-decryption key must be made
   available to the hardware module via a secure path.  The key might be
   delivered via physical media or via an independent electronic path.
   One optional mechanism for distributing the firmware-decryption key
   is specified in Section 2.3.1, but any secure key distribution
   mechanism is acceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The signature verification public key must be made available to the
   hardware module in a manner that preserves its integrity and confirms
   its source.  CMS supports the transfer of certificates, and this
   facility can be used to transfer a certificate that contains the
   signature verification public key (a firmware-signing certificate).
   However, use of this facility introduces a level of indirection.
   Ultimately, a trust anchor public key must be made available to the
   hardware module.  Section 1.2 establishes a requirement that the
   hardware module store one or more trust anchors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Hardware modules may not be capable of accessing certificate
   repositories or delegated path discovery (DPD) servers [DPD&DPV] to
   acquire certificates needed to complete a certification path.  Thus,
   it is the responsibility of the firmware package signer to include
   sufficient certificates to enable each module to validate the
   firmware-signer certificate (see Section 2.1.2).  Similarly, hardware
   modules may not be capable of accessing a certificate revocation list
   (CRL) repository, an OCSP responder [OCSP], or a delegated path
   validation (DPV) server [DPD&DPV] to acquire revocation status
   information.  Thus, if the firmware package signature cannot be
   validated solely with the trust anchor public key and the hardware
   module is not capable of performing full certification path
   validation, then it is the responsibility of the entity loading a
   package into a hardware module to validate the firmware-signer
   certification path prior to loading the package into a hardware
   module.  The means by which this external certificate revocation
   status checking is performed is beyond the scope of this
   specification.
   Hardware modules will only accept firmware packages with a valid
   digital signature.  The signature is either validated directly using
   the trust anchor public key or using a firmware-signer certification
   path that is validated to the trust anchor public key.  Thus, the
   trust anchors define the set of entities that can create firmware
   packages for the hardware module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The disposition of a previously loaded firmware package after the
   successful validation of another firmware package is beyond the scope
   of this specification.  The amount of memory available to the
   hardware module will determine the range of alternatives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In some cases, hardware modules can generate receipts to acknowledge
   the loading of a particular firmware package.  Such receipts can be
   used to determine which hardware modules need to receive an updated
   firmware package whenever a flaw in an earlier firmware package is
   discovered.  Hardware modules can also generate error reports to
   indicate the unsuccessful firmware package loading.  To implement
   either receipt or error report generation, the hardware module is
   required to have a unique permanent serial number.  Receipts and
   error reports can be either signed or unsigned.  To generate
   digitally signed receipts or error reports, a hardware module MUST be
   issued its own private signature key and a certificate that contains
   the corresponding signature validation public key.  In order to save
   memory with the hardware module, the hardware module might store a
   certificate designator instead of the certificate itself.  The
   private signature key requires secure storage.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Terminology</h3></a>

   In this document, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as
   described in [STDWORDS].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Architectural Elements</h3></a>

   The architecture includes the hardware module, the firmware package,
   and a bootstrap loader.  The bootstrap loader MUST have access to one
   or more trusted public keys, called trust anchors, to validate the
   signature on the firmware package.  If a signed firmware package load
   receipt or error report is created on behalf of the hardware module,
   then the bootstrap loader MUST have access to a private signature key
   to generate the signature and the signer identifier for the
   corresponding signature validation certificate or its designator.  A
   signature validation certificate MAY be included to aid signature
   validation.  To implement this optional capability, the hardware
   module MUST have a unique serial number and a private signature key;
   the hardware module MAY also include a certificate that contains the
   corresponding signature validation public key.  These items MUST be
   installed in the hardware module before it is deployed.  The private
   key and certificate can be generated and installed as part of the
   hardware module manufacture process.  Figure 1 illustrates these
   architectural elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ASN.1 object identifiers are the preferred means of naming the
   architectural elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Details of managing the trust anchors are beyond the scope of this
   specification.  However, one or more trust anchors MUST be installed
   in the hardware module using a secure process before it is deployed.
   These trust anchors provide a means of controlling the acceptable
   sources of firmware packages.  The hardware module vendor can include
   provisions for secure, remote management of trust anchors.  One
   approach is to include trust anchors in the firmware packages
   themselves.  This approach is analogous to the optional capability
   described later for updating the bootstrap loader.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In a cryptographic hardware module, the firmware package might
   implement many different cryptographic algorithms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the firmware package is encrypted, the firmware-decryption key
   and the firmware package MUST both be provided to the hardware
   module.  The firmware-decryption key is necessary to use the
   associated firmware package.  Generally, separate distribution
   mechanisms will be employed for the firmware-decryption key and the
   firmware package.  An optional mechanism for securely distributing
   the firmware-decryption key with the firmware package is specified in
   Section 2.3.1.<pre>

                     Figure 1.  Architectural Elements

	<a name="section-1.2.1"><h4>1.2.1   Hardware Module Requirements</h4></a>

   Many different vendors develop hardware modules, and each vendor
   typically identifies its modules by product type (family) and
   revision level.  A unique object identifier MUST name each hardware
   module type and revision.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Each hardware module within a hardware module family SHOULD have a
   unique permanent serial number.  However, if the optional receipt or
   error report generation capability is implemented, then the hardware
   module MUST have a unique permanent serial number.  If the optional
   receipt or error report signature capability is implemented, then the
   hardware module MUST have a private signature key and a certificate
   containing the corresponding public signature validation key or its
   designator.  If a serial number is present, the bootstrap loader uses
   it for authorization decisions (see Section 2.2.8), receipt
   generation (see Section 3), and error report generation (see
   Section 4).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the hardware module includes more than one firmware-programmable
   component, the bootstrap loader distributes components of the package
   to the appropriate components within the hardware module after the
   firmware package is validated.  The bootstrap loader is discussed
   further in Section 1.2.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2.2"><h4>1.2.2   Firmware Package Requirements</h4></a>

   Two approaches to naming firmware packages are supported: legacy and
   preferred.  Firmware package names are placed in a CMS signed
   attribute, not in the firmware package itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Legacy firmware package names are simply octet strings, and no
   structure is assumed.  This firmware package name form is supported
   in order to facilitate existing configuration management systems.  We
   assume that the firmware signer and the bootstrap loader will
   understand any internal structure to the octet string.  In
   particular, given two legacy firmware package names, we assume that
   the firmware signer and the bootstrap loader will be able to
   determine which one represents the newer version of the firmware
   package.  This capability is necessary to implement the stale version
   feature.  If a firmware package with a disastrous flaw is released,
   subsequent firmware package versions MAY designate a stale legacy
   firmware package name in order to prevent subsequent rollback to the
   stale version or versions earlier than the stale version.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Preferred firmware package names are a combination of the firmware
   package object identifier and a version number.  A unique object
   identifier MUST identify the collection of features that characterize
   the firmware package.  For example, firmware packages for a cable
   modem and a wireless LAN network interface card warrant distinct
   object identifiers.  Similarly, firmware packages that implement
   distinct suites of cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation,
   or that emulate different (non-programmable) cryptographic devices
   warrant distinct object identifiers.  The version number MUST
   identify a particular build or release of the firmware package.  The
   version number MUST be a monotonically increasing non-negative
   integer.  Generally, an earlier version is replaced with a later one.
   If a firmware package with a disastrous flaw is released, subsequent
   firmware package versions MAY designate a stale version number to
   prevent subsequent rollback to the stale version or versions earlier
   than the stale version.
   Firmware packages are developed to run on one or more hardware module
   type.  The firmware package digital signature MUST bind the list of
   supported hardware module object identifiers to the firmware package.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In many cases, the firmware package signature will be validated
   directly with the trust anchor public key, avoiding the need to
   construct certification paths.  Alternatively, the trust anchor can
   delegate firmware package signing to another public key through a
   certification path.  In the latter case, the firmware package SHOULD
   contain the certificates needed to construct the certification path
   that begins with a certificate issued by the trust anchors and ends
   with a certificate issued to the firmware package signer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The firmware package MAY contain a list of community identifiers.
   These identifiers name the hardware modules that are authorized to
   load the firmware package.  If the firmware package contains a list
   of community identifiers, then the bootstrap loader MUST reject the
   firmware package if the hardware module is not a member of one of the
   identified communities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a hardware module includes multiple programmable components, the
   firmware package SHOULD contain executable code for all of the
   components.  Internal tagging within the firmware package MUST tell
   the bootstrap loader which portion of the overall firmware package is
   intended for each component; however, this tagging is expected to be
   specific to each hardware module.  Because this specification treats
   the firmware package as an opaque binary object, the format of the
   firmware package is beyond the scope of this specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2.3"><h4>1.2.3   Bootstrap Loader Requirements</h4></a>

   The bootstrap loader MUST have access to a physical interface and any
   related driver or protocol software necessary to obtain a firmware
   package.  The same interface SHOULD be used to deliver receipts and
   error reports.  Details of the physical interface as well as the
   driver or protocol software are beyond the scope of this
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bootstrap loader can be a permanent part of the hardware module,
   or it can be replaced by loading a firmware package.  In Figure 1,
   the bootstrap loader is implemented as separate logic within the
   hardware module.  Not all hardware modules will include the ability

   loader MAY also contain other routines.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bootstrap loader requires access to cryptographic routines.
   These routines can be implemented specifically for the bootstrap
   loader, or they can be shared with other hardware module features.
   The bootstrap loader MUST have access to a one-way hash function and
   digital signature verification routines to validate the digital
   signature on the firmware package and to validate the certification
   path for the firmware-signing certificate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If firmware packages are encrypted, the bootstrap loader MUST have
   access to a decryption routine.  Access to a corresponding encryption
   function is not required, since hardware modules need not be capable
   of generating firmware packages.  Because some symmetric encryption
   algorithm implementations (such as AES [AES]) employ separate logic
   for encryption and decryption, some hardware module savings might
   result.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If firmware packages are compressed, the bootstrap loader MUST also
   have access to a decompression function.  This function can be

   modules need not be capable of generating firmware packages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the optional receipt generation or error report capability is
   supported, the bootstrap loader MUST have access to the hardware
   module serial number and the object identifier for the hardware

   error report capability is supported, the bootstrap loader MUST also
   have access to a one-way hash function and digital signature
   routines, the hardware module private signing key, and the
   corresponding signature validation certificate or its designator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bootstrap loader requires access to one or more trusted public
   keys, called trust anchors, to validate the firmware package digital
   signature.  One or more trust anchors MUST be installed in non-
   volatile memory prior to deployment.  The bootstrap loader MUST
   reject a firmware package if it cannot validate the signature, which
   MAY require the construction of a valid certification path from the
   firmware-signing certificate to one of the trust anchors [PROFILE].
   However, in many cases, the firmware package signature will be
   validated directly with the trust anchor public key, avoiding the
   need to construct certification paths.
   The bootstrap loader MUST reject a firmware package if the list of
   supported hardware module type identifiers within the firmware
   package does not include the object identifier of the hardware
   module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bootstrap loader MUST reject a firmware package if the firmware
   package includes a list of community identifiers and the hardware

   of determining community membership is beyond the scope of this
   specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bootstrap loader MUST reject a firmware package if it cannot
   successfully decrypt the firmware package using the firmware-
   decryption key available to the hardware module.  The firmware
   package contains an identifier of the firmware-decryption key needed
   for decryption.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When an earlier version of a firmware package is replacing a later
   one, the bootstrap loader SHOULD generate a warning.  The manner in
   which a warning is generated is highly dependent on the hardware
   module and the environment in which it is being used.  If a firmware
   package with a disastrous flaw is released and subsequent firmware
   package versions designate a stale version, the bootstrap loader
   SHOULD prevent loading of the stale version and versions earlier than

   A unique algorithm object identifier MUST also be assigned for each

   particular firmware package satisfies the needs of a particular
   application.  To facilitate the development of algorithm-agile

   applications to query the cryptographic module for the object
   identifiers associated with each cryptographic algorithm contained in
   the currently loaded firmware package.  Applications SHOULD also be

   The bootstrap loader MAY be permanently stored in read-only memory or
   separately loaded into non-volatile memory as discussed above.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In most hardware module designs, the firmware package execution
   environment offers a single address space.  If it does, the firmware
   package SHOULD contain a complete firmware package load for the
   hardware module.  In this situation, the firmware package does not
   contain a partial or incremental set of functions.  A complete
   firmware package load will minimize complexity and avoid potential
   security problems.  From a complexity perspective, the incremental
   loading of packages makes it necessary for each package to identify
   any other packages that are required (its dependencies), and the
   bootstrap loader needs to verify that all of the dependencies are
   satisfied before attempting to execute the firmware package.  When a
   hardware module is based on a general purpose processor or a digital
   signal processor, it is dangerous to allow arbitrary packages to be
   loaded simultaneously unless there is a reference monitor to ensure
   that independent portions of the code cannot interfere with one
   another.  Also, it is difficult to evaluate arbitrary combinations of
   software modules [SECREQMTS].  For these reasons, a complete firmware
   package load is RECOMMENDED; however, this specification allows the
   firmware signer to identify dependencies between firmware packages in
   order to handle all situations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The firmware packages MAY have dependencies on routines provided by

   complexity of a hardware module employing such a design, the firmware

   used) of the packages upon which it depends.  The bootstrap loader
   MUST reject a firmware package load if it contains a dependency on a
   firmware package that is not available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Loading a firmware package can impact the satisfactory resolution of
   dependencies of other firmware packages that are already part of the

   The CMS uses Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [X.208-88,
   X.209-88].  ASN.1 is a formal notation used for describing data
   protocols, regardless of the programming language used by the
   implementation.  Encoding rules describe how the values defined in
   ASN.1 will be represented for transmission.  The Basic Encoding Rules
   (BER) are the most widely employed rule set, but they offer more than
   one way to represent data structures.  For example, definite length
   encoding and indefinite length encoding are supported.  This
   flexibility is not desirable when digital signatures are used.  As a
   result, the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.509-88] were
   invented.  DER is a subset of BER that ensures a single way to
   represent a given value.  For example, DER always employs definite
   length encoding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In this specification, digitally signed structures MUST be encoded
   with DER.  Other structures do not require DER, but the use of
   definite length encoding is strongly RECOMMENDED.  By always using
   definite length encoding, the bootstrap loader will have fewer

   including portable memory devices, file transfer, and web pages.
   Section 2 of this specification defines the format that MUST be

   used.  This specification also specifies the format of the response
   that MAY be generated by the hardware module.  Section 3 of this
   specification defines the format that MAY be returned by the hardware
   module when a firmware package loads successfully.  Section 4 of this

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Firmware Package Protection</h2></a>

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used to protect a firmware
   package, which is treated as an opaque binary object.  A digital
   signature is used to protect the firmware package from undetected
   modification and to provide data origin authentication.  Encryption
   is optionally used to protect the firmware package from disclosure,
   and compression is optionally used to reduce the size of the
   protected firmware package.  The CMS ContentInfo content type MUST
   always be present, and it MUST encapsulate the CMS SignedData content
   type.  If the firmware package is encrypted, then the CMS SignedData
   content type MUST encapsulate the CMS EncryptedData content type.  If
   the firmware package is compressed, then either the CMS SignedData
   content type (when encryption is not used) or the CMS EncryptedData
   content type (when encryption is used) MUST encapsulate the CMS
   CompressedData content type.  Finally, (1) the CMS SignedData content<br>
   type (when neither encryption nor compression is used), (2) the CMS<br>
   EncryptedData content type (when encryption is used, but compression
   is not), or (3) the CMS CompressedData content type (when compression<br>
   is used) MUST encapsulate the simple firmware package using the
   FirmwarePkgData content type defined in this specification (see

   policies.  The certs field MUST be present, and the policies field
   MAY be present.  The fields of SigningCertificate are used as
   follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   certs contains a sequence of certificate identifiers.  In this case,
      sequence of certificate identifiers contains a single entry.  The
      certs field MUST contain only the certificate identifier of the
      certificate that contains the public key used to verify the
      firmware package signature.  The certs field uses the ESSCertID
      syntax specified in Section 5.4 of [ESS], and it is comprised of
      the SHA-1 hash [SHA1] of the entire ASN.1 DER encoded certificate
      and, optionally, the certificate issuer and the certificate serial
      number.  The SHA-1 hash value MUST be present.  The certificate
      issuer and the certificate serial number SHOULD be present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   policies is optional; when it is present, it contains a sequence of
      policy information.  The policies field, when present, MUST
      contain only one entry, and that entry MUST match one of the
      certificate policies in the certificate policies extension of the
      certificate that contains the public key used to verify the
      firmware package signature.  The policies field uses the
      PolicyInformation syntax specified in Section 4.2.1.5 of
      [PROFILE], and it is comprised of the certificate policy object
      identifier and, optionally, certificate policy qualifiers.  The
      certificate policy object identifier MUST be present.  The
      certificate policy qualifiers SHOULD NOT be present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.3"><h3>2.3   Unsigned Attributes</h3></a>

   CMS allows a SET of unsigned attributes to be included; however, in
   this specification, the set MUST be absent or include a single
   instance of the wrapped-firmware-decryption-key attribute.  Because
   the digital signature does not cover this attribute, it can be
   altered at any point in the delivery path from the firmware package
   signer to the hardware module.  This property can be employed to
   distribute the firmware-decryption key along with an encrypted and
   signed firmware package, allowing the firmware-decryption key to be
   wrapped with a different key-encryption key for each link in the
   distribution chain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax for attributes is defined in [CMS], and it is repeated at
   the beginning of Section 2.2 of this document for convenience.  Each
   of the attributes used with this profile has a single attribute
   value, even though the syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue.
   There MUST be exactly one instance of AttributeValue present.
   The UnsignedAttributes syntax within signerInfo is defined as a SET
   OF Attribute.  The UnsignedAttributes MUST include only one instance
   of any particular attribute.

   The wrapped-firmware-decryption-key attribute values have ASN.1 type
   of EnvelopedData.  Section 6 of [CMS] defines the EnvelopedData
   content type, which is used to construct the value of the attribute.
   EnvelopedData permits the firmware-decryption key to be protected
   using symmetric or asymmetric techniques.  The EnvelopedData does not
   include an encrypted content; rather, the EnvelopedData feature of
   having the encrypted content in another location is employed.  The
   encrypted content is found in the eContent field of the EncryptedData
   structure.  The firmware-decryption key is contained in the
   recipientInfos field.  Section 6 of [CMS] refers to this key as the
   content-encryption key.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The EnvelopedData syntax supports many different key management
   algorithms.  Four general techniques are supported: key transport,
   key agreement, symmetric key-encryption keys, and passwords.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The EnvelopedData content type is profiled for the wrapped-firmware-
   decryption-key attribute.  The EnvelopedData fields are described
   fully in Section 6 of [CMS].  Additional rules apply when
   EnvelopedData is used as a wrapped-firmware-decryption-key attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Within the EnvelopedData structure, the following apply:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  The set of certificates included in OriginatorInfo MUST NOT
      include certificates with a type of extendedCertificate,
      v1AttrCert, or v2AttrCert [X.509-97, X.509-00, ACPROFILE].  The

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used to indicate that a

   load receipts is OPTIONAL.  However, those hardware modules that
   choose to generate such receipts MUST follow the conventions
   specified in this section.  Because not all hardware modules will
   have private signature keys, the firmware package load receipt can be
   either signed or unsigned.  Use of the signed firmware package load
   receipt is RECOMMENDED.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Hardware modules that support receipt generation MUST have a unique
   serial number.  Hardware modules that support signed receipt
   generation MUST have a private signature key to sign the receipt and
   the corresponding signature validation certificate or its designator.
   The designator is the certificate issuer name and the certificate
   serial number, or it is the public key identifier.  Memory-
   constrained hardware modules will generally store the public key
   identifier since it requires less storage.

   also defines the firmware package load receipt content type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.1"><h4>3.1.1   ContentInfo</h4></a>

   The CMS requires that the outermost encapsulation be ContentInfo
   [CMS].  The fields of ContentInfo are used as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   contentType indicates the type of the associated content.  If the
      firmware package load receipt is signed, then the encapsulated
      type MUST be SignedData, and the id-signedData
      (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2) object identifier MUST be present in this

      MUST be FirmwarePackageLoadReceipt, and the id-ct-
      firmwareLoadReceipt (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.17) object identifier
      MUST be present in this field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   content holds the associated content.  If the firmware package load

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.2"><h4>3.1.2   SignedData</h4></a>

   The SignedData content type contains the firmware package load
   receipt and one digital signature.  If the hardware module locally
   stores its certificate, then the certificate can be included as well.
   The fields of SignedData are used as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   version is the syntax version number, and in this case, it MUST be
      set to 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   digestAlgorithms is a collection of message digest algorithm
      identifiers, and in this case, it MUST contain a single message
      digest algorithm identifier.  The message digest algorithms
      employed by the hardware module MUST be present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   encapContentInfo is the signed content, consisting of a content type
      identifier and the content itself.  The use of the
      EncapsulatedContentInfo type is discussed further in Section
      3.1.2.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   certificates is an optional collection of certificates.  If the
      hardware module locally stores its certificate, then the X.509
      certificate of the hardware module SHOULD be included.  If the
      hardware module does not, then the certificates field is omitted.
      PKCS#6 extended certificates [PKCS#6] and attribute certificates
      (either version 1 or version 2) [X.509-97, X.509-00, ACPROFILE]
      MUST NOT be included in the set of certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   crls is an optional collection of certificate revocation lists
      (CRLs).  CRLs MAY be included, but they will normally be omitted
      since hardware modules will not generally have access to the most
      recent CRL.  Signed receipt recipients SHOULD be able to handle
      the presence of the optional crls field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   signerInfos is a collection of per-signer information, and in this

      which results in the use of version 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   sid specifies the hardware module's certificate (and thereby the
      hardware module's public key).  CMS supports two alternatives:
      issuerAndSerialNumber and subjectKeyIdentifier.  The hardware
      module MUST support one or both of the alternatives for receipt
      generation; however, the support of subjectKeyIdentifier is
      RECOMMENDED.  The issuerAndSerialNumber alternative identifies the
      hardware module's certificate by the issuer's distinguished name
      and the certificate serial number.  The identified certificate, in
      turn, contains the hardware module's public key.  The
      subjectKeyIdentifier alternative identifies the hardware module's
      public key directly.  When this public key is contained in a
      certificate, this identifier SHOULD appear in the X.509
      subjectKeyIdentifier extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   digestAlgorithm identifies the message digest algorithm, and any
      associated parameters, used by the hardware module.  It MUST
      contain the message digest algorithms employed to sign the
      receipt.  (Note that this message digest algorithm identifier MUST
      be the same as the one carried in the digestAlgorithms value in
      SignedData.)
   signedAttrs is an optional collection of attributes that are signed
      along with the content.  The signedAttrs are optional in the CMS,
      but in this specification, signedAttrs are REQUIRED for use with
      the firmware package load receipt content.  The SET OF attributes
      MUST be DER encoded [X.509-88].  Section 3.2 of this document
      lists the attributes that MUST be included in the collection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   fwPkgName identifies the firmware package that was loaded.  As
      described in Section 2.2.3, two approaches to naming firmware
      packages are supported: legacy and preferred.  A legacy firmware

   It also defines the firmware package load error content type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.1"><h4>4.1.1   ContentInfo</h4></a>

   The CMS requires that the outermost encapsulation be ContentInfo
   [CMS].  The fields of ContentInfo are used as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   contentType indicates the type of the associated content.  If the
      firmware package load error report is signed, then the
      encapsulated type MUST be SignedData, and the id-signedData
      (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2) object identifier MUST be present in this
      field.  If the report is not signed, then the encapsulated type
      MUST be FirmwarePackageLoadError, and the id-ct-firmwareLoadError
      (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.18) object identifier MUST be present in
      this field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   content holds the associated content.  If the firmware package load

      contain the FirmwarePackageLoadError.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.2"><h4>4.1.2   SignedData</h4></a>

   The SignedData content type contains the firmware package load error
   report and one digital signature.  If the hardware module locally
   stores its certificate, then the certificate can be included as well.
   The fields of SignedData are used exactly as described in Section
   3.1.2.

   The FirmwarePackageLoadError is encapsulated in an OCTET STRING, and
   it is carried within the EncapsulatedContentInfo type.  The fields of
   EncapsulatedContentInfo are used as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   eContentType is an object identifier that uniquely specifies the

      encoded.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1.3"><h4>4.1.3   FirmwarePackageLoadError</h4></a>

   The following object identifier identifies the firmware package load

      VendorLoadErrorCode ::= INTEGER

   The fields of the FirmwarePackageLoadError type have the following
   meanings:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   version is an integer, and it provides the syntax version number for
      compatibility with future revisions of this specification.
      Implementations that conform to this specification MUST set the
      version to the default value, which is v1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   hwType is an object identifier that identifies the type of hardware
      module on which the firmware package load was attempted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   hwSerialNum is the serial number of the hardware module on which the
      firmware package load was attempted.  No particular structure is
      imposed on the serial number; it need not be an integer.  However,
      the combination of the hwType and hwSerialNum uniquely identifies
      the hardware module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   errorCode identifies the error that occurred.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   vendorErrorCode is optional; however, it MUST be present if the
      errorCode contains a value of otherError.  When errorCode contains
      a value other than otherError, the vendorErrorCode can provide
      vendor-specific supplemental information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   fwPkgName is optional.  When it is present, it identifies the
      firmware package that was being loaded when the error occurred.
      As described in Section 2.2.3, two approaches to naming firmware
      packages are supported: legacy and preferred.  A legacy firmware
      package name is an octet string.  A preferred firmware package
      name is a combination of the firmware package object identifier
      and an integer version number.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   config identifies the current firmware configuration.  The field is
      OPTIONAL, but support for this field is RECOMMENDED for hardware
      modules that permit the loading of more than one firmware package.
      One instance of CurrentFWConfig is used to provide information
      about each firmware package in hardware module.
   The fields of the CurrentFWConfig type have the following meanings:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   fwPkgType identifies the firmware package type.  The firmware package
      type is an INTEGER, and the meaning of the integer value is
      specific to each hardware module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   fwPkgName identifies the firmware package.  As described in Section
      2.2.3, two approaches to naming firmware packages are supported:

      the subjectKeyIdentifier does not identify the public key of a
      trust anchor or a certification path that terminates with an
      installed trust anchor.  In the other case, the
      issuerAndSerialNumber does not identify the public key of a trust
      anchor or a certification path that terminates with an installed
      trust anchor.

   appropriate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2.1"><h4>4.2.1   Content Type</h4></a>

   The hardware module MUST include a content-type attribute with the

	<a name="section-4.2.3"><h4>4.2.3   Signing Time</h4></a>

   If the hardware module includes a real-time clock, then hardware
   module SHOULD include a signing-time attribute, specifying the time
   at which the firmware package load error report was generated.
   Section 11.3 of [CMS] defines the signing-time attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Hardware Module Name</h2></a>

   Support for firmware package load receipts, as discussed in Section
   3, is OPTIONAL, and support for the firmware package load error
   reports, as discussed in Section 4, is OPTIONAL.  Hardware modules
   that support receipt or error report generation MUST have unique
   serial numbers.  Further, hardware modules that support signed
   receipt or error report generation MUST have private signature keys
   and corresponding signature validation certificates [PROFILE] or
   their designators.  The conventions for hardware module naming in the
   signature validation certificates are specified in this section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The hardware module vendor or a trusted third party MUST issue the
   signature validation certificate prior to deployment of the hardware
   module.  The certificate is likely to be issued at the time of
   manufacture.  The subject alternative name in this certificate
   identifies the hardware module.  The subject distinguished name is
   empty, but a critical subject alternative name extension contains the
   hardware module name, using the otherName choice within the
   GeneralName structure.

   The fields of the HardwareModuleName type have the following
   meanings:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   hwType is an object identifier that identifies the type of hardware
      module.  A unique object identifier names a hardware model and
      revision.
   hwSerialNum is the serial number of the hardware module.  No

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document describes the use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) to protect firmware packages; therefore, the security
   considerations discussed in [CMS] apply to this specification as
   well.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The conventions specified in this document raise a few security
   considerations of their own.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Cryptographic Keys and Algorithms</h3></a>

   Private signature keys must be protected.  Compromise of the private
   key used to sign firmware packages permits unauthorized parties to
   generate firmware packages that are acceptable to hardware modules.
   Compromise of the hardware module private key allows unauthorized
   parties to generate signed firmware package load receipts and error
   reports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The firmware-decryption key must be protected.  Compromise of the key
   may result in the disclosure of the firmware package to unauthorized
   parties.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Cryptographic algorithms become weaker with time.  As new
   cryptanalysis techniques are developed and computing performance
   improves, the work factor to break a particular cryptographic
   algorithm will be reduced.  The ability to change the firmware
   package provides an opportunity to update or replace cryptographic
   algorithms.  Although this capability is desirable, cryptographic
   algorithm replacement can lead to interoperability failures.
   Therefore, the rollout of new cryptographic algorithms must be
   managed.  Generally, the previous generation of cryptographic
   algorithms and their replacements need to be supported at the same
   time in order to facilitate an orderly transition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Random Number Generation</h3></a>

   When firmware packages are encrypted, the source of the firmware
   package must randomly generate firmware-encryption keys.  Also, the
   generation of public/private signature key pairs relies on a random
   numbers.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number generators
   (PRNGs) to generate cryptographic keys can result in little or no
   security.  An attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG
   environment that produced the keys, searching the resulting small set
   of possibilities, rather than brute-force searching the whole key
   space.  The generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  RFC
   4086 [RANDOM] offers important guidance in this area.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3   Stale Firmware Package Version Number</h3></a>

   The firmware signer determines whether a stale version number is
   included.  The policy of the firmware signer needs to consider many
   factors.  Consider the flaw found by Ian Goldberg and David Wagner in
   the random number generator of the Netscape browser in 1996 [DDJ].
   This flaw completely undermines confidentiality protection.  A
   firmware signer might use the stale version number to ensure that
   upgraded hardware modules do not resume use of the flawed firmware.
   However, another firmware signer may not consider this an appropriate
   situation to employ the stale version number, preferring to delegate
   this decision to someone closer to the operation of the hardware
   module.  Such a person is likely to be in a better position to
   evaluate whether other bugs introduced in the newer firmware package
   impose worse operational concerns than the confidentiality concern
   caused by the flawed random number generator.  For example, a user
   who never uses the encryption feature of the flawed Netscape browser
   will determine the most appropriate version to use without
   considering the random number flaw or its fix.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The stale version number is especially useful when the security
   interests of the person choosing which firmware package version to
   load into a particular hardware module do not align with the security
   interests of the firmware package signer.  For example, stale version
   numbers may be useful in hardware modules that provide digital rights
   management (DRM).  Also, stale version numbers will be useful when
   the deployment organization (as opposed to the firmware package
   vendor) is the firmware signer.  Further, stale version numbers will
   be useful for firmware packages that need to be trusted to implement
   organizational (as opposed to the deployment organization) security
   policy, regardless of whether the firmware signer is the deployment
   organization or the vendor.  For example, hardware devices employed
   by the military will probably make use of stale version numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of a stale version number in a firmware package that employs
   the preferred firmware package name form cannot completely prevent
   subsequent use of the stale firmware package.  Despite this
   shortcoming, the feature is included since it is useful in some
   important situations.  By loading different types of firmware
   packages, each with its own stale firmware package version number
   until the internal storage for the stale version number is exceeded,
   the user can circumvent the mechanism.  Consider a hardware module
   that has storage for two stale version numbers.  Suppose that FWPKG-A
   version 3 is loaded, indicating that FWPKG-A version 2 is stale.  The
   user can sequentially load the following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      - FWPKG-B version 8, indicating that FWPKG-B version 4 is stale.
          (Note: The internal storage indicates that FWPKG-A version 2
           and FWPKG-B version 4 are stale.)

      - FWPKG-C version 5, indicating that FWPKG-C version 3 is stale.
          (Note: The internal storage indicates that FWPKG-B version 4
           and FWPKG-C version 3 are stale.)

      - FWPKG-A version 2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Because many hardware modules are expected to have very few firmware
   packages written for them, the stale firmware package version feature
   provides important protections.  The amount of non-volatile storage
   that needs to be dedicated to saving firmware package identifiers and
   version numbers depends on the number of firmware packages that are
   likely to be developed for the hardware module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The use of legacy firmware package name form does not improve this
   situation.  In fact, the legacy firmware package names are usually
   larger than an object identifier.  Thus, comparable stale version
   protection requires more memory.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A firmware signer can ensure that stale version numbers are honored
   by limiting the number of different types of firmware packages that
   are signed.  If all of the hardware modules are able to store a stale
   version number for each of the different types of firmware package,
   then the hardware module will be able to provide the desired
   protection.  This requires the firmware signer to have a deep
   understanding of all of the hardware modules that might accept the
   firmware package.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.4"><h3>6.4   Community Identifiers</h3></a>

   When a firmware package includes a community identifier, the
   confidence that the package is only used by the intended community
   depends on the mechanism used to configure community membership.
   This document does not specify a mechanism for the assignment of
   community membership to hardware modules, and the various
   alternatives have different security properties.  Also, the authority
   that makes community identifier assignments to hardware modules might
   be different than the authority that generates firmware packages.

Appendix A: ASN.1 Module

   The ASN.1 module contained in this appendix defines the structures
   that are needed to implement the CMS-based firmware package wrapper.
   It is expected to be used in conjunction with the ASN.1 modules in
   [CMS], [COMPRESS], and [PROFILE].
