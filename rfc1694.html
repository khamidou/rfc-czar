   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the

   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing objects for SMDS
   access interfaces. This includes the following access protocols:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             SIP [13]
             SIP/DXI [18] and [20]
             SIP/FR [19]
             SIP/ATM [24]

   This memo replaces RFC 1304 [12], and defines a MIB module which is
   both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI and semantically-identical to the
   existing RFC 1304-based definitions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo also assumes application of the MIB II Interfaces group as
   defined in [9].

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of
        management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o STD 17, RFC 1213 [6] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  Reference [12]
        defines the evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB II in
        terms of extensions and precise applications of the objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o RFC 1445 [4] which defines the administrative and other
        architectural aspects of the framework.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o RFC 1448 [5] which defines the protocol used for network
        access to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This specification makes also use of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o RFC 1443 [2] which defines textual conventions for the
        specification of managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o RFC 1444 [3] which defines conformance statements for the
        specification of managed objects.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Objects</h2></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI RFC 1442 purposely restricts the
   ASN.1 constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are
   explicitly made for simplicity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.  The SMI
   specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject
   to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Format of Definitions</h3></a>

   Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in the SNMPv2 SMI.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   SMDS is a service that can be provided by numerous interface
   protocols as shown in the following figure:

   With the improved interpretation of the MIB II interfaces group [9],
   some objects can be represented by ifTable. This means that these
   objects have been deprecated from the MIB module defined in RFC 1304,
   and ifTable is used instead. No semantical changes have been made to
   these objects. Only the object identifiers and object descriptors
   have been changed to the objects defined in ifTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementation experience has shown that the objects
   sipL3UnrecognizedIndividualDAs and sipL3UnrecognizedGAs were not
   supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   SIP Level 3</h3></a>

   Objects for SIP Level 3 apply to all methods to access SMDS shown in
   the figures above. With the improved interpretation of the MIB II
   interfaces group, most objects can be represented by ifTable. The
   appropriate mapping is defined below.
   This document does not specify objects for the management of
   subscription or configuration of Subscriber-Network Interfaces
   (SNIs). Those objects are defined in Definitions of Managed Objects
   for SMDS Subscription [17]. Bellcore requirements on these objects
   are specified in TR-TSV-001062 [16].
