                  CHANGE OF NETWORK ADDRESS FOR SU-DSL

Effective immediately, the Host at Stanford Electronics Research Lab.
(SU-DSL), a Very Distant Host connected to the SRI IMP, has its address
changed from IMP 2, Host 2, to IMP 2 Host 3.  Thus its "Network Address"
is changed from 130 to 194.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Host 2 on IMP 2 will eventually be a PDP-11 operated by the SRI
Artificial Intelligence Center.
