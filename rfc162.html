                              NETBUGGER3

   NETBUGGER3 is a third level program for the debugging of second and
   third level programs, experimentation with and simulation of third
   level protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We were writing an RJE FILENET to interact with UCLA-CCN, and
   discovered that they (UCLA-CCN) wouldn't be up for a few months.  We
   needed a program that would simulate CCN, so that we could interact
   with it and debug our FILENET.  It occurred to me that all over the
   network, people had similar problems, i.e., they couldn't debug
   programs because the intended server wasn't up.  And so I started to
   write a third level debugger-simulater.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With NETBUGGER3 the user can easily issue RTSs, STRs, and LISTENs,
   interrogate the status of connections, receive and display NCP-USER
   events and transmit and receive data over as many as twelve
   connections (per copy of program running).  Received data can be
   displayed in ASCII, EBCDIC on HEX.  The user can, of course,
   originate data for transmission in the same forms.  NETBUGGER3 can be
   initiator, receiver and/or intermediate in connections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example of how NETBUGGER3 could be of use to other hosts on the
   Net follows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Host X has a special third level Filenet to debug.  The host they
   plan to interact with won't be up for several months.  Host X can
   arrange with us to interact with NETBUGGER3, which will simulate the
   proposed third level protocol and transactions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An alternate possibility is for Host X to use his Telnet to enter our
   system and start NETBUGGER3 himself.  He can then be running
   NETBUGGER3 on one console and his filenet on another.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An alternate possibility is for Host X to use his Telnet to enter our
   system and start NETBUGGER3 himself.  He can then be running
   NETBUGGER3 on one console and his filenet on another.
   Then, later on when the other server Host is up, NETBUGGER3 can be
   used an intermediate between Host X and his serving host.  Every
   message from Host X to server and vice versa can be displayed,
   examined and, if necessary, edited as it passes through the
   NETBUGGER3 console, thus making possible the debugging and
   measurements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This is only one example.  If you are interested in using, receiving,
   documentation, making suggestions or anything else regarding
   NETBUGGER3, please contact the Network liaison at UCLA - NMC.
