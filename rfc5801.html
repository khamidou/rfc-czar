 Using Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
     Mechanisms in Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL):
                        The GS2 Mechanism Family

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service
   Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by
   defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism
   family offers a number of improvements over the previous "SASL/
   GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the
   authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of
   channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel
   binding and mutual authentication are supported.

   Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] is a framework that provides security services to
   applications using a variety of authentication mechanisms.  Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a framework to
   provide authentication and security layers for connection-based
   protocols, also using a variety of mechanisms.  This document
   describes how to use a GSS-API mechanism as though it were a SASL
   mechanism.  This facility is called GS2 -- a moniker that indicates
   that this is the second GSS-API->SASL mechanism bridge.  The original
   GSS-API->SASL mechanism bridge was specified by [RFC2222], now
   [RFC4752]; we shall sometimes refer to the original bridge as GS1 in
   this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All GSS-API mechanisms are implicitly registered for use within SASL
   by this specification.  The SASL mechanisms defined in this document
   are known as the GS2 family of mechanisms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The GS1 bridge failed to gain wide deployment for any GSS-API
   mechanism other than "The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism"
   [RFC1964] [RFC4121], and has a number of problems that led us to
   desire a new bridge.  Specifically, a) GS1 was not round-trip
   optimized and b) GS1 did not support channel binding [RFC5056].
   These problems and the opportunity to create the next SASL password-
   based mechanism, "Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism
   (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms" [RFC5802], as a GSS-API
   mechanism used by SASL applications via GS2, provide the motivation
   for GS2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In particular, the current consensus of the SASL community appears to
   be that SASL "security layers" (i.e., confidentiality and integrity
   protection of application data after authentication) are too complex
   and redundant because SASL applications tend to have an option to run
   over a Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] channel.  Use of SASL
   security layers is best replaced with channel binding to a TLS
   channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GS2 is designed to be as simple as possible.  It adds to GSS-API
   security context token exchanges only the bare minimum to support
   SASL semantics and negotiation of use of channel binding.
   Specifically, GS2 adds a small header (a few bytes plus the length of
   the client-requested SASL authorization identity) to the initial GSS-
   API context token and to the application channel binding data.  GS2
   uses SASL mechanism negotiation to implement channel binding
   negotiation.  Security-relevant GS2 plaintext is protected via the
   use of GSS-API channel binding.  Additionally, to simplify the
   implementation of GS2 mechanisms for implementors who will not
   implement a GSS-API framework, we compress the initial security
   context token header required by [RFC2743], Section 3.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GS2 does not protect any plaintext exchanged outside GS2, such as
   SASL mechanism negotiation plaintext, or application messages
   following authentication.  But using channel binding to a secure
   channel over which all SASL and application plaintext is sent will
   cause all that plaintext to be authenticated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The document uses many terms and function names defined in [RFC2743],
   as updated by [RFC5554].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Mechanism Name</h2></a>

   There are two SASL mechanism names for any GSS-API mechanism used
   through this facility.  One denotes that the server supports channel
   binding.  The other denotes that it does not.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SASL mechanism name for a GSS-API mechanism is that which is
   provided by that mechanism when it was specified, if one was
   specified.  This name denotes that the server does not support
   channel binding.  Add the suffix "-PLUS" and the resulting name
   denotes that the server does support channel binding.  SASL
   implementations can use the GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech call (see
   below) to query for the SASL mechanism name of a GSS-API mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech interface is not used, the GS2
   implementation needs some other mechanism to map mechanism Object
   Identifiers (OIDs) to SASL names internally.  In this case, the
   implementation can only support the mechanisms for which it knows the
   SASL name.  If GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech() fails and the GS2
   implementation cannot map the OID to a SASL mechanism name via some
   other means, then the GS2 implementation MUST NOT use the given GSS-
   API mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Generating SASL Mechanism Names from GSS-API OIDs</h3></a>

   For GSS-API mechanisms whose SASL names are not defined together with
   the GSS-API mechanism or in this document, the SASL mechanism name is
   concatenation of the string "GS2-" and the Base32 encoding [RFC4648]
   (with an uppercase alphabet) of the first 55 bits of the binary SHA-1
   hash [FIPS.180-1.1995] string computed over the ASN.1 DER encoding
   [CCITT.X690.2002], including the tag and length octets, of the GSS-
   API mechanism's Object Identifier.  The Base32 rules on padding
   characters and characters outside of the Base32 alphabet are not
   relevant to this use of Base32.  If any padding or non-alphabet
   characters are encountered, the name is not a GS2 family mechanism
   name.  This name denotes that the server does not support channel
   binding.  Add the suffix "-PLUS" and the resulting name denotes that
   the server does support channel binding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A GS2 mechanism that has a non-OID-derived SASL mechanism name is
   said to have a "user-friendly SASL mechanism name".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Computing Mechanism Names Manually</h3></a>

   The hash-derived GS2 SASL mechanism name may be computed manually.
   This is useful when the set of supported GSS-API mechanisms is known
   in advance.  This eliminates the need to implement Base32, SHA-1, and
   DER in the SASL mechanism.  The computed mechanism name can be used
   directly in the implementation, and the implementation need not be
   concerned if the mechanism is part of a mechanism family.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Examples</h3></a>

   The OID for the Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM-1)
   [RFC2025] is 1.3.6.1.5.5.1.1.  The ASN.1 DER encoding of the OID,
   including the tag and length, is (in hex) 06 07 2b 06 01 05 05 01 01.
   The SHA-1 hash of the ASN.1 DER encoding is (in hex) 1c f8 f4 2b 5a
   9f 80 fa e9 f8 31 22 6d 5d 9d 56 27 86 61 ad.  Convert the first 7
   octets to binary, drop the last bit, and re-group them in groups of
   5, and convert them back to decimal, which results in these
   computations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   hex:
   1c f8 f4 2b 5a 9f 80

   binary:
   00011100 11111000 11110100 00101011 01011010
   10011111 1000000

   binary in groups of 5:
   00011 10011 11100 01111 01000 01010 11010 11010
   10011 11110 00000

   decimal of each group:
   3 19 28 15 8 10 26 26 19 30 0
   base32 encoding:
   D T 4 P I K 2 2 T 6 A

   The last step translates each decimal value using table 3 in Base32
   [RFC4648].  Thus, the SASL mechanism name for the SPKM-1 GSSAPI
   mechanism is "GS2-DT4PIK22T6A".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OID for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC1964] is
   1.2.840.113554.1.2.2 and its DER encoding is (in hex) 06 09 2A 86 48
   86 F7 12 01 02 02.  The SHA-1 hash is 82 d2 73 25 76 6b d6 c8 45 aa
   93 25 51 6a fc ff 04 b0 43 60.  Convert the 7 octets to binary, drop
   the last bit, and re-group them in groups of 5, and convert them back
   to decimal, which results in these computations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   hex:
   82 d2 73 25 76 6b d6

   binary:
   10000010 11010010 01110011 00100101 01110110
   01101011 1101011

   binary in groups of 5:
   10000 01011 01001 00111 00110 01001 01011 10110
   01101 01111 01011

   decimal of each group:
   16 11 9 7 6 9 11 22 13 15 11

   base32 encoding:
   Q L J H G J L W N P L

   The last step translates each decimal value using table 3 in Base32
   [RFC4648].  Thus, the SASL mechanism name for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API
   mechanism would be "GS2-QLJHGJLWNPL" and (because this mechanism
   supports channel binding) "GS2-QLJHGJLWNPL-PLUS".  Instead, the next
   section assigns the Kerberos V5 mechanism a non-hash-derived
   mechanism name.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Grandfathered Mechanism Names</h3></a>

   Some older GSS-API mechanisms were not specified with a SASL GS2
   mechanism name.  Using a shorter name can be useful, nonetheless.  We
   specify the names "GS2-KRB5" and "GS2-KRB5-PLUS" for the Kerberos V5
   mechanism, to be used as if the original specification documented it,
   see Section 15.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   SASL Authentication Exchange Message Format</h2></a>

   During the SASL authentication exchange for GS2, a number of messages
   following the following format are sent between the client and
   server.  On success, this number is the same as the number of context
   tokens that the GSS-API mechanism would normally require in order to
   establish a security context.  On failures, the exchange can be
   terminated early by any party.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using a GS2 mechanism the SASL client is always a GSS-API
   initiator and the SASL server is always a GSS-API acceptor.  The
   client calls GSS_Init_sec_context and the server calls
   GSS_Accept_sec_context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All the SASL authentication messages exchanged are exactly the same
   as the security context tokens of the GSS-API mechanism, except for
   the initial security context token.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The client and server MAY send GSS-API error tokens (tokens output by
   GSS_Init_sec_context() or GSS_Accept_sec_context() when the major
   status code is other than GSS_S_COMPLETE or GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED).
   As this indicates an error condition, after sending the token, the
   sending side should fail the authentication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The initial security context token is modified as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The initial context token header (see Section 3.1 of [RFC2743])
      MUST be removed if present.  If the header is not present, the
      client MUST send a "gs2-nonstd-flag" flag (see below).  On the
      server side, this header MUST be recomputed and restored prior to
      passing the token to GSS_Accept_sec_context, except when the "gs2-
      nonstd-flag" is sent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A GS2 header MUST be prefixed to the resulting initial context
      token.  This header has the form "gs2-header" given below in ABNF
      [RFC5234].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The figure below describes the permissible attributes, their use, and
   the format of their values.  All attribute names are single US-ASCII
   letters and are case sensitive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the "gs2-nonstd-flag" flag is present, the client did not find/
   remove a token header ([RFC2743], Section 3.1) from the initial token

   MUST NOT re-add the data that is normally removed by the client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "gs2-cb-flag" signals the channel binding mode.  One of "p", "n",
   or "y" is used.  A "p" means the client supports and used a channel
   binding, and the name of the channel binding type is indicated.  An
   "n" means that the client does not support channel binding.  A "y"
   means the client supports channel binding, but believes the server
   does not support it, so it did not use a channel binding.  See the
   next section for more details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "gs2-authzid" holds the SASL authorization identity.  It is
   encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629] with three exceptions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The NUL character is forbidden as required by section 3.4.1 of
      [RFC4422].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The server MUST replace any "," (comma) in the string with "=2C".
   o  The server MUST replace any "=" (equals) in the string with "=3D".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Upon receipt of this value, the server verifies its correctness
   according to the used SASL protocol profile.  Failed verification
   results in a failed authentication exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Channel Bindings</h2></a>

   GS2 supports channel binding to external secure channels, such as
   TLS.  Clients and servers may or may not support channel binding;
   therefore, the use of channel binding is negotiable.  However, GS2
   does not provide security layers; therefore, it is imperative that
   GS2 provide integrity protection for the negotiation of channel
   binding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of channel binding is negotiated as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Servers that support the use of channel binding SHOULD advertise
      both the non-PLUS and PLUS-variant of each GS2 mechanism name.  If
      the server cannot support channel binding, it SHOULD advertise
      only the non-PLUS-variant.  If the server would never succeed in
      the authentication of the non-PLUS-variant due to policy reasons,
      it MUST advertise only the PLUS-variant.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the client supports channel binding and the server does not
      appear to (i.e., the client did not see the -PLUS name advertised
      by the server), then the client MUST NOT use an "n" gs2-cb-flag.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Clients that support mechanism negotiation and channel binding
      MUST use a "p" gs2-cb-flag when the server offers the PLUS-variant
      of the desired GS2 mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the client does not support channel binding, then it MUST use
      an "n" gs2-cb-flag.  Conversely, if the client requires the use of
      channel binding then it MUST use a "p" gs2-cb-flag.  Clients that
      do not support mechanism negotiation never use a "y" gs2-cb-flag,
      they use either "p" or "n" according to whether they require and

   negotiate mechanism X by using a GSS-API mechanism that negotiates
   other mechanisms (such as Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation
   (SPNEGO) [RFC4178]), it may end up using mechanism Z when it ideally

   registry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IANA is further advised that GS2 SASL mechanism names MUST NOT
   end in "-PLUS" except as a version of another mechanism name simply
   suffixed with "-PLUS".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SASL names for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121]
   [RFC1964] used via GS2 SHALL be "GS2-KRB5" and "GS2-KRB5-PLUS".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SASL names for the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism used via GS2 SHALL be
   "SPNEGO" and "SPNEGO-PLUS".  As described in Section 14, the SASL
   "SPNEGO" and "SPNEGO-PLUS" MUST NOT be used.  These names are
   provided as a convenience for SASL library implementors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-16"><h2>16.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security issues are also discussed throughout this memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The security provided by a GS2 mechanism depends on the security of
   the GSS-API mechanism.  The GS2 mechanism family depends on channel
   binding support, so GSS-API mechanisms that do not support channel
   binding cannot be successfully used as SASL mechanisms via the GS2
   bridge.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Because GS2 does not support security layers, it is strongly
   RECOMMENDED that channel binding to a secure external channel be
   used.  Successful channel binding eliminates the possibility of man-
   in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, provided that the external channel and
   its channel binding data are secure and that the GSS-API mechanism
   used is secure.  Authentication failure because of channel binding
   failure may indicate that an MITM attack was attempted, but note that
   a real MITM attacker would likely attempt to close the connection to
   the client or simulate network partition; thus, MITM attack detection
   is heuristic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use of channel binding will also protect the SASL mechanism
   negotiation -- if there is no MITM, then the external secure channel
   will have protected the SASL mechanism negotiation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The channel binding data MAY be sent (by the actual GSS-API mechanism
   used) without confidentiality protection and knowledge of it is
   assumed to provide no advantage to an MITM (who can, in any case,
   compute the channel binding data independently).  If the external
   channel does not provide confidentiality protection and the GSS-API
   mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the channel
   binding data, then passive attackers (eavesdroppers) can recover the
   channel binding data, see [RFC5056].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When constructing the input_name_string for GSS_Import_name with the
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name type, the client SHOULD NOT
   canonicalize the server's fully qualified domain name using an
   insecure or untrusted directory service, such as the Domain Name
   System [RFC1034] without DNS Security (DNSSEC) [RFC4033].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SHA-1 is used to derive SASL mechanism names, but no traditional
   cryptographic properties are required -- the required property is
   that the truncated output for distinct inputs are different for
   practical input values.  GS2 does not use any other cryptographic
   algorithm.  Therefore, GS2 is "algorithm agile", or, as agile as the
   GSS-API mechanisms that are available for use in SASL applications
   via GS2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GS2 does not protect against downgrade attacks of channel binding
   types.  Negotiation of channel binding type was intentionally left
   out of scope for this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The security considerations of SASL [RFC4422], the GSS-API [RFC2743],
   channel binding [RFC5056], any external channels (such as TLS,
   [RFC5246], channel binding types (see the IANA channel binding type
   registry), and GSS-API mechanisms (such as the Kerberos V5 mechanism
   [RFC4121] [RFC1964]), also apply.
	<a name="section-17"><h2>17.   Acknowledgements</h2></a>

   The history of GS2 can be traced to the "GSSAPI" mechanism originally
   specified by RFC 2222.  This document was derived from [SASL-GSSAPI],
   which was prepared by Alexey Melnikov with significant contributions
   from John G. Myers, although the majority of this document has been
   rewritten by the current authors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Contributions of many members of the SASL mailing list are gratefully
   acknowledged.  In particular, ideas and feedback from Pasi Eronen,
   Sam Hartman, Jeffrey Hutzelman, Alexey Melnikov, and Tom Yu improved
   the document and the protocol.  Other suggestions to the documents
   were made by Spencer Dawkins, Ralph Droms, Adrian Farrel, Robert
   Sparks, and Glen Zorn.
