                  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based
   internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing DS3 and E3
   Interfaces.  This document is a companion document with Definitions
   of Managed Objects for the DS1 Interface Type.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document entirely replaces RFC 1233, which contains a
   fundamental error: many objects are encoded as Counters that must be
   encoded as INTEGERs or Gauges.  The magnitude of the change required
   is sufficient that virtually every object changed.  Therefore, the
   MIB documented in RFC 1233 should not be implemented.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   The Network Management Framework</h2></a>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213, defines MIB-II,
      an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Objects</h2></a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.  The SMI
   specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject
   to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   Format of Definitions</h3></a>

   Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in STD 16, RFC 1212 [13].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Changes from RFC 1233</h3></a>

   This MIB obsoletes RFC 1233.  The changes from RFC 1233 are the
   following:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  This MIB module contains information to manage
          an E3 interface, also.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  This MIB module contains three groups:
           DS3/E3 Near End Group which is mandatory,
           DS3 Far End Group which is optional, and
           DS3 Fractional Group which is optional.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  The DS3 Far End Group is a new group and contains
          configuration information and statistics
          that are collected from the far end DS3/E3 interface.
          Presently, the Far End Group may only be implemented by
          DS3 systems that use C-bit Parity or SYNTRAN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  The DS3 Fractional Group is a new group and is
          modeled after the DS1 Fractional Group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  ds3CSUIndex has been redefined and renamed
          to dsx3LineIndex.  This object
          is the identifier of a DS3/E3 Interface on a device.
          On a CSU, a single DS3/E3 data stream will cross two DS3/E3
          interfaces, which have separate dsx3LineIndex values.
      --  ds3Index has been redefined and renamed to
          dsx3IfIndex.  This value for this
          object is equal to the value of ifIndex from the Interfaces
          table of MIB II (STD 17, RFC 1213).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  The ACCESS for objects in the dsx3ConfigTable has
          been set to read-write for items that are configurable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  The dsx3ZeroCoding has been renamed to dsx3LineCoding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  A new object has been added called dsx3LoopbackConfig,
          which better describes the loopback capabilities of
          a DS3/E3 interface on a device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  The dsx3SendCode object has been updated to reflect
          different types of loopback messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  A new object has been added called dsx3LineStatus.
          This object better describes the status (e.g.,
          failure state and loopback state) of a
          DS3/E3 interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  A new object has been added called dsx3TransmitClockSource.
          This object identifies the source for the transmit clock.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  All Counters have been changed to Gauges.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  A Line Errored Seconds object has been added to
          all near end tables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  Line Coding Violations are counted instead of Bipolar
          Violations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  A new Coding Violation counter has been added to count
          coding violations reported via the C-bits of SYNTRAN
          and C-bit Parity DS3 applications.
          The original Coding Violation counter has been renamed
          to PCV to mean coding violations reported via the P-bits.
          This count is also added for symmetry with the far end
          statistics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      --  A new Errored Second counter and Severely Errored Second
          counter has been added to count these performance events
          via the C-bits of the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3
          applications.  The original ES and SES counters have been
          renamed to PES and PSES to mean reported via the P-bits.
          These counts are also added for symmetry with the far end
          statistics.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS3/E3 interface.  At present, this applies
   to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">               ds3 (30)

   The DS3 definitions contained herein are based on the DS3
   specifications in ANSI T1.102-1987, ANSI T1.107-1988, ANSI T1.107a-
   1990, and ANSI T1.404-1989 [9,10,10a,11].  The E3 definitions
   contained herein are based on the E3 specifications in CCITT G.751
   [14].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Binding between ifIndex and DS3/E3 Interfaces</h3></a>

   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3
   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different
   indices for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These
   indices are dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed
   DS3/E3 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing
   on the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces directly):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal
   to ifIndex, and the following applies:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             ifIndex=dsx3IfIndex=dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The dsx3IfIndex column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each
   DS3/E3 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the
   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC 1213).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.
   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3
   interfaces external from the host/DS3/E3-device combination, but also
   the DS3/E3 interfaces connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.  The
   index dsx3IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:<pre>

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                     dsx3LineIndex

                    1                   NA                  NA (Ethernet)
                    2      Line#A   Router Side             6
                    2      Line#A   Network Side            7
                    3      Line#B   Router Side             8
                    3      Line#B   Network Side            9
                    4      Line#C   Router Side            10
                    4      Line#C   Network Side           11
                    5      Line#D   Router Side            12
                    5      Line#D   Network Side           13

   For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.  Note the following
   description of dsx3LineIndex: the dsx3LineIndex identifies a DS3/E3
   Interface on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is
   directly associated with this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it
   should have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the
   dsx3LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of
   choosing a number greater than ifNumber and numbering inside
   interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside
   interfaces (e.g., network side) with odd numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the
   situation would be:
            ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                      dsx3LineIndex

                    1      Line#A     Network Side            1
                    2      Line#A     RouterSide              2
                    3      Line#B     Network Side            3

                    5      Line#C     Network Side            5
                    6      Line#C     Router Side             6

	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Objectives of this MIB Module</h3></a>

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS3/E3
   signals: the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   all devices with DS3/E3 interfaces.  As such, a design decision was
   made up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects
   that can generally be read from DS3/E3 devices that are currently
   deployed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   DS3/E3 Terminology</h3></a>

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a DS3 interface as monitored by a DS3 device are based on the
   definitions from the ANSI T1M1.3/92-005R1 draft standard [12].  If
   the definition in this document does not match the definition in the
   ANSI T1M1.3/92-005R1 draft document, the implementer should follow
   the definition described in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1   Error Events</h4></a>

          Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
            A bipolar violation error event, for B3ZS(HDB3)-coded
            signals, is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity
            as the previous pulse without being part of the zero
            substitution code, B3ZS(HDB3).  For B3ZS(HDB3)-coded
            signals, a bipolar violation error event may also include
            other error patterns such as:  three(four) or more
            consecutive zeros and incorrect polarity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Excessive Zeros (EXZ) Error Event
            An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string length equal
            to or greater than 3 for B3ZS, or greater than 4 for HDB3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event
            This parameter is a count of both BPVs and EXZs
            occurring over the accumulation period.  An EXZ
            increments the LCV by one regardless of the length
            of the zero string.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          P-bit Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event
            For all DS3 applications, a coding violation error
            event is a P-bit
            Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error event is the
            occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame
            that is not identical to the corresponding locally-
            calculated code.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          C-bit Coding Violation (CCV) Error Event
            For C-bit Parity and SYNTRAN DS3 applications, this is
            the count of coding violations reported via the C-bits.
            For C-bit Parity, it is a count of CP-bit parity errors
            occurring in the accumulation interval.  For SYNTRAN, it
            is a count of CRC-9 errors occurring in the accumulation
            interval.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2   Performance Parameters</h4></a>

   All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute
   intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an
   agent.  Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the
   agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition,
   there is a rolling 24-hour total of each performance parameter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Line Errored Seconds (LES)
            A Line Errored Second is a second in
            which one or more CVs occurred OR one or more LOS defects.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          P-bit Errored Seconds (PES)
            An PES is a second with one or more PCVs OR
            one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
            This gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          P-bit Severely Errored Seconds (PSES)
            A PSES is a second with 44 or more PCVs OR
            one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Unavailable Seconds (UAS)
            UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that
            the interface is unavailable.  The DS3 interface is said
            to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous PSESs, or
            the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure
            States).  If the condition leading to the failure was
            immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then
            the DS3 interface unavailability starts from the onset of
            these PSESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is
            present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset
            of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs.  Once unavailable,
            and if a failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes
            available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no
            PSESs, if the failure clearing time is less than
            or equal to 10 seconds.  If the failure clearing time is
            more than 10 seconds, the DS3 interface becomes available
            at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, or
            the onset period leading to the successful clearing
            condition, whichever occurs later.  With respect to the
            DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented
            while the DS3 interface is deemed available.  While the
            interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is
            incremented is UASs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
            crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
            foregoing description implies that the PSES and UAS
            counters must be adjusted when the Unavailable Signal
            State is entered. Clearly, successive GETs of the
            affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and dsx3IntervalUASs objects
            will return differing values if the first GET occurs
            during the first few seconds of the window.  This is
            viewed as an unavoidable side-effect of selecting the
            presently defined managed objects as a basis for this
            memo.

          Failure States:
            The Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) failure, in SYNTRAN
            applications, is declared after detecting
            the Yellow Alarm Signal on the alarm channel.  See ANSI
            T1.107a-1990 [10].  The Remote Alarm Indication failure,
            in C-bit Parity DS3 applications, is declared
            as soon as the preqsence of either one or two alarm signals
            are detected on then Far End Alarm Channel.  See [10].
            The Remote Alarm Indication failure may also be declared
            after detecting the far-end SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow).
            The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared as soon as
            the presence of the any of the above alarms are removed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            Also, the incoming failure state is declared when a defect
            persists for at least 2-10 seconds.  The defects are
            the following:  Loss of Signal (LOS), an Out of Frame (OOF)
            or an incoming Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).
            The Failure State is cleared when the defect is absent
            for less than or equal to 20 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Far End SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow)
            A Far End SEF/AIS defect is the occurrence of the two X-bits
            in a M-frame set to zero.  The Far End SEF/AIS defect is
            terminated when the two X-bits in a M-frame are set to
            one.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Out of Frame (OOF) defect
            A DS3 OOF defect is detected when any three or more errors
            in sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3
            M-frame.  An OOF defect may also be called a Severely
            Errored Frame (SEF) defect.  An OOF defect is cleared when
            reframe occurs.  A DS3 Loss of Frame (LOF) failure is
            declared when the DS3 OOF defect is consistent for 2 to 10
            seconds.  The DS3 OOF defect ends when reframe occurs.
            The DS3 LOF failure is cleared when the DS3 OOF
            defect is absent for 10 to 20 seconds.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            An E3 OOF defect is detected when four consecutive frame
            alignment signals have been incorrectly received in there
            predicted positions in an E3 signal. E3 frame alignment
            occurs when the presence of three consecutive frame
            alignment signals have been detected.
          Loss of Signal (LOS) defect
            The DS3 LOS defect is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
            contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
            positive or negative polarity.
            The DS3 LOS defect is terminated upon observing an average
            pulse density of at least 33% over a period of 175 +/- 75
            contiguous pulse positions starting with the receipt of a
            pulse.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">          Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) defect
            The DS3 AIS is framed with "stuck stuffing."  This implies
            that it has a valid M-subframe alignments bits, M-frame
            alignment bits, and P bits.  The information bits are set
            to a 1010... sequence, starting with a one (1) after each<br>
            M-subframe alignment bit, M-frame alignment bit, X bit, P
            bit, and C bit.  The C bits are all set to zero giving
            what is called "stuck stuffing."  The X bits are set to
            one.  The DS3 AIS defect is declared after DS3 AIS is
            present in contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or
            greater than T, where 0.2 ms <= T <= 100 ms.
            The DS3 AIS defect is terminated after AIS is absent in
            contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or greater than T.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">            The E3 binary content of the AIS is nominally a continuous
            stream of ones.  AIS detection and the application of
            consequent actions, should be completed within a time
            limit of 1 ms.
