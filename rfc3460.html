</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document specifies a number of changes to the Policy Core
   Information Model (PCIM, RFC 3060).  Two types of changes are
   included.  First, several completely new elements are introduced, for
   example, classes for header filtering, that extend PCIM into areas
   that it did not previously cover.  Second, there are cases where
   elements of PCIM (for example, policy rule priorities) are
   deprecated, and replacement elements are defined (in this case,
   priorities tied to associations that refer to policy rules).  Both
   types of changes are done in such a way that, to the extent possible,
   interoperability with implementations of the original PCIM model is
   preserved.  This document updates RFC 3060.

   This document specifies a number of changes to the Policy Core
   Information Model (PCIM), RFC 3060 [1].  Two types of changes are
   included.  First, several completely new elements are introduced, for
   example, classes for header filtering, that extend PCIM into areas
   that it did not previously cover.  Second, there are cases where
   elements of PCIM (for example, policy rule priorities) are
   deprecated, and replacement elements are defined (in this case,
   priorities tied to associations that refer to policy rules).  Both
   types of changes are done in such a way that, to the extent possible,
   interoperability with implementations of the original PCIM model is
   preserved.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [8].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Changes since RFC 3060</h2></a>

   Section 3.2 contains a short discussion of the changes that this
   document makes to the RFC 3060 information model.  Here is a very
   brief list of the changes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. Deprecate and replace PolicyRepository and its associations.
   2. Clarify and expand the ways that PolicyRules and PolicyGroups are
      aggregated.
   3. Change how prioritization for PolicyRules is represented, and
      introduce administrator-specified decision strategies for rule
      evaluation.
   4. Expand the role of PolicyRoles, and introduce a means of
      associating a PolicyRole with a resource.
   5. Introduce compound policy conditions and compound policy actions
      into the model.
   6. Introduce variables and values into the model.
   7. Introduce variable and value subclasses for packet-header
      filtering.
   8. Introduce classes for device-level packet-header filtering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Overview of the Changes</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  How to Change an Information Model</h3></a>

   The Policy Core Information Model is closely aligned with the DMTF's
   CIM Core Policy model.  Since there is no separately documented set
   of rules for specifying IETF information models such as PCIM, it is
   reasonable to look to the CIM specifications for guidance on how to
   modify and extend the model.  Among the CIM rules for changing an
   information model are the following.  Note that everything said here
   about "classes" applies to association classes (including
   aggregations) as well as to non- association classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Properties may be added to existing classes.
   o  Classes, and individual properties, may be marked as DEPRECATED.
      If there is a replacement feature for the deprecated class or
      property, it is identified explicitly.  Otherwise the notation "No
      value" is used.  In this document, the notation "DEPRECATED FOR
      <feature-name>" is used to indicate that a feature has been
      deprecated, and to identify its replacement feature.
   o  Classes may be inserted into the inheritance hierarchy above
      existing classes, and properties from the existing classes may
      then be "pulled up" into the new classes.  The net effect is that
      the existing classes have exactly the same properties they had
      before, but the properties are inherited rather than defined
      explicitly in the classes.
   o  New subclasses may be defined below existing classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  List of Changes to the Model</h3></a>

   The following subsections provide a very brief overview of the
   changes to PCIM defined in PCIMe.  In several cases, the origin of
   the change is noted, as QPIM [11], ICPM [12], or QDDIM [15].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.1"><h4>3.2.1  Changes to PolicyRepository</h4></a>

   Because of the potential for confusion with the Policy Framework
   component Policy Repository (from the four-box picture: Policy
   Management Tool, Policy Repository, PDP, PEP), "PolicyRepository" is
   a bad name for the PCIM class representing a container of reusable
   policy elements.  Thus the class PolicyRepository is being replaced
   with the class ReusablePolicyContainer.  To accomplish this change,
   it is necessary to deprecate the PCIM class PolicyRepository and its
   three associations, and replace them with a new class
   ReusablePolicyContainer and new associations.  As a separate change,
   the associations for ReusablePolicyContainer are being broadened, to
   allow a ReusablePolicyContainer to contain any reusable policy
   elements.  In PCIM, the only associations defined for a
   PolicyRepository were for it to contain reusable policy conditions
   and policy actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.2"><h4>3.2.2  Additional Associations and Additional Reusable Elements</h4></a>

   The PolicyRuleInPolicyRule and PolicyGroupInPolicyRule aggregations
   have, in effect, been imported from QPIM.  ("In effect" because these
   two aggregations, as well as PCIM's two aggregations
   PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup and PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup, are all being
   combined into a single aggregation PolicySetComponent.)  These
   aggregations make it possible to define larger "chunks" of reusable
   policy to place in a ReusablePolicyContainer.  These aggregations
   also introduce new semantics representing the contextual implications
   of having one PolicyRule executing within the scope of another
   PolicyRule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.3"><h4>3.2.3  Priorities and Decision Strategies</h4></a>

   Drawing from both QPIM and ICPM, the Priority property has been
   deprecated in PolicyRule, and placed instead on the aggregation
   PolicySetComponent.  The QPIM rules for resolving relative priorities
   across nested PolicyGroups and PolicyRules have been incorporated
   into PCIMe as well.  With the removal of the Priority property from
   PolicyRule, a new modeling dependency is introduced.  In order to
   prioritize a PolicyRule/PolicyGroup relative to other
   PolicyRules/PolicyGroups, the elements being prioritized must all
   reside in one of three places: in a common PolicyGroup, in a common
   PolicyRule, or in a common System.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the absence of any clear, general criterion for detecting policy
   conflicts, the PCIM restriction stating that priorities are relevant
   only in the case of conflicts is being removed.  In its place, a
   PolicyDecisionStrategy property has been added to the PolicyGroup and
   PolicyRule classes.  This property allows policy administrator to
   select one of two behaviors with respect to rule evaluation: either
   perform the actions for all PolicyRules whose conditions evaluate to
   TRUE, or perform the actions only for the highest-priority PolicyRule
   whose conditions evaluate to TRUE.  (This is accomplished by placing
   the PolicyDecisionStrategy property in an abstract class PolicySet,
   from which PolicyGroup and PolicyRule are derived.)  The QPIM rules
   for applying decision strategies to a nested set of PolicyGroups and
   PolicyRules have also been imported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.4"><h4>3.2.4  Policy Roles</h4></a>

   The concept of policy roles is added to PolicyGroups (being present
   already in the PolicyRule class).  This is accomplished via a new
   superclass for both PolicyRules and PolicyGroups - PolicySet.  For
   nested PolicyRules and PolicyGroups, any roles associated with the
   outer rule or group are automatically "inherited" by the nested one.
   Additional roles may be added at the level of a nested rule or group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It was also observed that there is no mechanism in PCIM for assigning
   roles to resources.  For example, while it is possible in PCIM to
   associate a PolicyRule with the role "FrameRelay&&WAN", there is no
   way to indicate which interfaces match this criterion.  A new
   PolicyRoleCollection class has been defined in PCIMe, representing
   the collection of resources associated with a particular role.  The
   linkage between a PolicyRule or PolicyGroup and a set of resources is
   then represented by an instance of PolicyRoleCollection.  Equivalent
   values should be defined in the PolicyRoles property of PolicyRules
   and PolicyGroups, and in the PolicyRole property in
   PolicyRoleCollection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.5"><h4>3.2.5  CompoundPolicyConditions and CompoundPolicyActions</h4></a>

   The concept of a CompoundPolicyCondition has also been imported into
   PCIMe from QPIM, and broadened to include a parallel
   CompoundPolicyAction.  In both cases the idea is to create reusable
   "chunks" of policy that can exist as named elements in a
   ReusablePolicyContainer.  The "Compound" classes and their
   associations incorporate the condition and action semantics that PCIM
   defined at the PolicyRule level: DNF/CNF for conditions, and ordering
   for actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Compound conditions and actions are defined to work with any
   component conditions and actions.  In other words, while the
   components may be instances, respectively, of SimplePolicyCondition
   and SimplePolicyAction (discussed immediately below), they need not
   be.
	<a name="section-3.2.6"><h4>3.2.6  Variables and Values</h4></a>

   The SimplePolicyCondition / PolicyVariable / PolicyValue structure
   has been imported into PCIMe from QPIM.  A list of PCIMe-level
   variables is defined, as well as a list of PCIMe-level values.  Other
   variables and values may, if necessary, be defined in submodels of
   PCIMe.  For example, QPIM defines a set of implicit variables
   corresponding to fields in RSVP flows.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A corresponding SimplePolicyAction / PolicyVariable / PolicyValue
   structure is also defined.  While the semantics of a
   SimplePolicyCondition are "variable matches value", a
   SimplePolicyAction has the semantics "set variable to value".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.7"><h4>3.2.7  Domain-Level Packet Filtering</h4></a>

   For packet filtering specified at the domain level, a set of
   PolicyVariables and PolicyValues are defined, corresponding to the
   fields in an IP packet header plus the most common Layer 2 frame
   header fields.  It is expected that domain-level policy conditions
   that filter on these header fields will be expressed in terms of
   CompoundPolicyConditions built up from SimplePolicyConditions that
   use these variables and values.  An additional PolicyVariable,
   PacketDirection, is also defined, to indicate whether a packet being
   filtered is traveling inbound or outbound on an interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2.8"><h4>3.2.8  Device-Level Packet Filtering</h4></a>

   For packet filtering expressed at the device level, including the
   packet classifier filters modeled in QDDIM, the variables and values
   discussed in Section 3.2.7 need not be used.  Filter classes derived
   from the CIM FilterEntryBase class hierarchy are available for use in
   these contexts.  These latter classes have two important differences
   from the domain-level classes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  They support specification of filters for all of the fields in a
      particular protocol header in a single object instance.  With the
      domain-level classes, separate instances are needed for each
      header field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  They provide native representations for the filter values, as
      opposed to the string representation used by the domain-level
      classes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Device-level filter classes for the IP-related headers (IP, UDP, and
   TCP) and the 802 MAC headers are defined, respectively, in Sections
   6.19 and 6.20.

   Figure 2.    Association Class Inheritance Hierarchy for PCIMe

   In addition to these changes that show up at the class and
   association class level, there are other changes from PCIM involving
   individual class properties.  In some cases new properties are
   introduced into existing classes, and in other cases existing
   properties are deprecated (without deprecating the classes that
   contain them).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.  Areas of Extension to PCIM</h2></a>

   The following subsections describe each of the areas for which PCIM
   extensions are being defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1  Policy Scope</h3></a>

   Policy scopes may be thought of in two dimensions: 1) the level of
   abstraction of the policy specification and 2) the applicability of
   policies to a set of managed resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1  Levels of Abstraction: Domain- and Device-Level Policies</h4></a>

   Policies vary in level of abstraction, from the business-level
   expression of service level agreements (SLAs) to the specification of
   a set of rules that apply to devices in a network.  Those latter
   policies can, themselves, be classified into at least two groups:
   those policies consumed by a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that specify
   the rules for an administrative and functional domain, and those
   policies consumed by a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) that specify
   the device-specific rules for a functional domain.  The higher-level
   rules consumed by a PDP, called domain-level policies, may have late
   binding variables unspecified, or specified by a classification,
   whereas the device-level rules are likely to have fewer unresolved
   bindings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is a relationship between these levels of policy specification
   that is out of scope for this standards effort, but that is necessary
   in the development and deployment of a usable policy-based
   configuration system.  An SLA-level policy transformation to the
   domain-level policy may be thought of as analogous to a visual
   builder that takes human input and develops a programmatic rule
   specification.  The relationship between the domain-level policy and
   the device-level policy may be thought of as analogous to that of a
   compiler and linkage editor that translates the rules into specific
   instructions that can be executed on a specific type of platform.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PCIM and PCIMe may be used to specify rules at any and all of these
   levels of abstraction.  However, at different levels of abstraction,
   different mechanisms may be more or less appropriate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.2"><h4>5.1.2  Administrative and Functional Scopes</h4></a>

   Administrative scopes for policy are represented in PCIM and in these
   extensions to PCIM as System subclass instances.  Typically, a
   domain-level policy would be scoped by an AdminDomain instance (or by
   a hierarchy of AdminDomain instances) whereas a device-level policy
   might be scoped by a System instance that represents the PEP (e.g.,
   an instance of ComputerSystem, see CIM [2]).  In addition to
   collecting policies into an administrative domain, these System
   classes may also aggregate the resources to which the policies apply.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Functional scopes (sometimes referred to as functional domains) are
   generally defined by the submodels derived from PCIM and PCIMe, and
   correspond to the service or services to which the policies apply.
   So, for example, Quality of Service may be thought of as a functional
   scope, or Diffserv and Intserv may each be thought of as functional
   scopes.  These scoping decisions are represented by the structure of
   the submodels derived from PCIM and PCIMe, and may be reflected in
   the number and types of PEP policy client(s), services, and the
   interaction between policies.  Policies in different functional
   scopes are organized into disjoint sets of policy rules.  Different
   functional domains may share some roles, some conditions, and even
   some actions.  The rules from different functional domains may even
   be enforced at the same managed resource, but for the purposes of
   policy evaluation they are separate.  See section 5.5.3 for more
   information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The functional scopes MAY be reflected in administrative scopes.
   That is, deployments of policy may have different administrative
   scopes for different functional scopes, but there is no requirement
   to do so.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2  Reusable Policy Elements</h3></a>

   In PCIM, a distinction was drawn between reusable PolicyConditions
   and PolicyActions and rule-specific ones.  The PolicyRepository class
   was also defined, to serve as a container for these reusable
   elements.  The name "PolicyRepository" has proven to be an
   unfortunate choice for the class that serves as a container for
   reusable policy elements.  This term is already used in documents
   like the Policy Framework, to denote the location from which the PDP
   retrieves all policy specifications, and into which the Policy
   Management Tool places all policy specifications.  Consequently, the
   PolicyRepository class is being deprecated, in favor of a new class
   ReusablePolicyContainer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a class is deprecated, any associations that refer to it must
   also be deprecated.  So replacements are needed for the two
   associations PolicyConditionInPolicyRepository and
   PolicyActionInPolicyRepository, as well as for the aggregation
   PolicyRepositoryInPolicyRepository.  In addition to renaming the
   PolicyRepository class to ReusablePolicyContainer, however, PCIMe is
   also broadening the types of policy elements that can be reusable.
   Consequently, rather than providing one-for-one replacements for the
   two associations, a single higher-level association ReusablePolicy is
   defined.  This new association allows any policy element (that is, an
   instance of any subclass of the abstract class Policy) to be placed
   in a ReusablePolicyContainer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Summarizing, the following changes in Sections 6 and 7 are the result
   of this item:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The class ReusablePolicyContainer is defined.
   o  PCIM's PolicyRepository class is deprecated.
   o  The association ReusablePolicy is defined.
   o  PCIM's PolicyConditionInPolicyRepository association is
      deprecated.
   o  PCIM's PolicyActionInPolicyRepository association is deprecated.
   o  The aggregation ContainedDomain is defined.
   o  PCIM's PolicyRepositoryInPolicyRepository aggregation is
      deprecated.
	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3  Policy Sets</h3></a>

   A "policy" can be thought of as a coherent set of rules to
   administer, manage, and control access to network resources ("Policy
   Terminology", reference [10]).  The structuring of these coherent
   sets of rules into subsets is enhanced in this document.  In Section
   5.4, we discuss the new options for the nesting of policy rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A new abstract class, PolicySet, is introduced to provide an
   abstraction for a set of rules.  It is derived from Policy, and it is
   inserted into the inheritance hierarchy above both PolicyGroup and
   PolicyRule.  This reflects the additional structural flexibility and
   semantic capability of both subclasses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two properties are defined in PolicySet: PolicyDecisionStrategy and
   PolicyRoles.  The PolicyDecisionStrategy property is included in
   PolicySet to define the evaluation relationship among the rules in
   the policy set.  See Section 5.5 for more information.  The
   PolicyRoles property is included in PolicySet to characterize the
   resources to which the PolicySet applies.  See Section 5.6 for more
   information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Along with the definition of the PolicySet class, a new concrete
   aggregation class is defined that will also be discussed in the
   following sections.  PolicySetComponent is defined as a subclass of
   PolicyComponent; it provides the containment relationship for a
   PolicySet in a PolicySet.  PolicySetComponent replaces the two PCIM
   aggregations PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup and PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup, so
   these two aggregations are deprecated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PolicySet's relationship to an AdminDomain or other administrative
   scoping system (for example, a ComputerSystem) is represented by the
   PolicySetInSystem abstract association.  This new association is
   derived from PolicyInSystem, and the PolicyGroupInSystem and
   PolicyRuleInSystem associations are now derived from
   PolicySetInSystem instead of directly from PolicyInSystem.  The
   PolicySetInSystem.Priority property is discussed in Section 5.5.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4  Nested Policy Rules</h3></a>

   As previously discussed, policy is described by a set of policy rules
   that may be grouped into subsets.   In this section we introduce the
   notion of nested rules, or the ability to define rules within rules.
   Nested rules are also called sub-rules, and we use both terms in this
   document interchangeably.  The aggregation PolicySetComponent is used
   to represent the nesting of a policy rule in another policy rule.
	<a name="section-5.4.1"><h4>5.4.1  Usage Rules for Nested Rules</h4></a>

   The relationship between rules and sub-rules is defined as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The parent rule's condition clause is a condition for evaluation
      of all nested rules; that is, the conditions of the parent are
      logically ANDed to the conditions of the sub-rules.  If the parent
      rule's condition clause evaluates to FALSE, sub-rules MAY be
      skipped since they also evaluate to FALSE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the parent rule's condition evaluates to TRUE, the set of sub-
      rules SHALL BE evaluated according to the decision strategy and
      priorities as discussed in Section 5.5.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the parent rule's condition evaluates to TRUE, the parent
      rule's set of actions is executed BEFORE execution of the sub-
      rules actions.  The parent rule's actions are not to be confused
      with default actions.  A default action is one that is to be
      executed only if none of the more specific sub-rules are executed.
      If a default action needs to be specified, it needs to be defined
      as an action that is part of a catchall sub-rule associated with
      the parent rule.  The association linking the default action(s) in
      this special sub-rule should have the lowest priority relative to
      all other sub-rule associations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        if parent-condition then parent rule's action
                   if condA then actA
                   if condB then ActB
                   if True then default action

      Such a default action functions as a default when FirstMatching
      decision strategies are in effect (see section 5.5).  If
      AllMatching applies, the "default" action is always performed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Policy rules have a context in which they are executed.  The rule
      engine evaluates and applies the policy rules in the context of
      the managed resource(s) that are identified by the policy roles
      (or by an explicit association).  Submodels MAY add additional
      context to policy rules based on rule structure; any such
      additional context is defined by the semantics of the action
      classes of the submodel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4.2"><h4>5.4.2  Motivation</h4></a>

   Rule nesting enhances Policy readability, expressiveness and
   reusability.  The ability to nest policy rules and form sub-rules is
   important for manageability and scalability, as it enables complex
   policy rules to be constructed from multiple simpler policy rules.
   These enhancements ease the policy management tools' task, allowing
   policy rules to be expressed in a way closer to how humans think.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Although rule nesting can be used to suggest optimizations in the way
   policy rules are evaluated, as discussed in section 5.5.2 "Side
   Effects," nesting does not specify nor does it require any particular
   order of evaluation of conditions.  Optimization of rule evaluation
   can be done in the PDP or in the PEP by dedicated code.  This is
   similar to the relation between a high level programming language
   like C and machine code.  An optimizer can create a more efficient
   machine code than any optimization done by the programmer within the
   source code.  Nevertheless, if the PEP or PDP does not do
   optimization, the administrator writing the policy may be able to
   influence the evaluation of the policy rules for execution using rule
   nesting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Nested rules are not designed for policy repository retrieval

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5  Priorities and Decision Strategies</h3></a>

   A "decision strategy" is used to specify the evaluation method for
   the policies in a PolicySet.  Two decision strategies are defined:
   "FirstMatching" and "AllMatching."  The FirstMatching strategy is
   used to cause the evaluation of the rules in a set such that the only
   actions enforced on a given examination of the PolicySet are those
   for the first rule (that is, the rule with the highest priority) that
   has its conditions evaluate to TRUE.  The AllMatching strategy is
   used to cause the evaluation of all rules in a set; for all of the
   rules whose conditions evaluate to TRUE, the actions are enforced.
   Implementations MUST support the FirstMatching decision strategy;
   implementations MAY support the AllMatching decision strategy.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As previously discussed, the PolicySet subclasses are PolicyGroup and
   PolicyRule: either subclass may contain PolicySets of either
   subclass.  Loops, including the degenerate case of a PolicySet that
   contains itself, are not allowed when PolicySets contain other
   PolicySets.  The containment relationship is specified using the
   PolicySetComponent aggregation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The relative priority within a PolicySet is established by the
   Priority property of the PolicySetComponent aggregation of the
   contained PolicyGroup and PolicyRule instances.  The use of PCIM's
   PolicyRule.Priority property is deprecated in favor of this new
   property.  The separation of the priority property from the rule has
   two advantages.  First, it generalizes the concept of priority, so
   that it can be used for both groups and rules.  Second, it places the
   priority on the relationship between the parent policy set and the
   subordinate policy group or rule.  The assignment of a priority value
   then becomes much easier, in that the value is used only in
   relationship to other priorities in the same set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Together, the PolicySet.PolicyDecisionStrategy and
   PolicySetComponent.Priority determine the processing for the rules
   contained in a PolicySet.  As before, the larger priority value
   represents the higher priority.  Unlike the earlier definition,
   PolicySetComponent.Priority MUST have a unique value when compared
   with others defined for the same aggregating PolicySet.  Thus, the
   evaluation of rules within a set is deterministically specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For a FirstMatching decision strategy, the first rule (that is, the
   one with the highest priority) in the set that evaluates to True, is
   the only rule whose actions are enforced for a particular evaluation
   pass through the PolicySet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For an AllMatching decision strategy, all of the matching rules are
   enforced.  The relative priority of the rules is used to determine
   the order in which the actions are to be executed by the enforcement
   point:  the actions of the higher priority rules are executed first.
   Since the actions of higher priority rules are executed first, lower
   priority rules that also match may get the "last word," and thus
   produce a counter-intuitive result.  So, for example, if two rules
   both evaluate to True, and the higher priority rule sets the DSCP to
   3 and the lower priority rule sets the DSCP to 4, the action of the
   lower priority rule will be executed later and, therefore, will
   "win," in this example, setting the DSCP to 4.  Thus, conflicts
   between rules are resolved by this execution order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An implementation of the rule engine need not provide the action
   sequencing but the actions MUST be sequenced by the PEP or PDP on its
   behalf.  So, for example, the rule engine may provide an ordered list
   of actions to be executed by the PEP and any required serialization
   is then provided by the service configured by the rule engine.  See
   Section 5.5.2 for a discussion of side effects.

   As discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, PolicySet instances may be
   nested arbitrarily.  For a FirstMatching decision strategy on a
   PolicySet, any contained PolicySet that matches satisfies the
   termination criteria for the FirstMatching strategy.  A PolicySet is
   considered to match if it is a PolicyRule and its conditions evaluate
   to True, or if the PolicySet is a PolicyGroup and at least one of its
   contained PolicyGroups or PolicyRules match.  The priority associated
   with contained PolicySets, then, determines when to terminate rule
   evaluation in the structured set of rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the example shown in Figure 3, the relative priorities for the

   Although evaluation of conditions is sometimes discussed as an

   a procedural language interpreter.  Any side effects of condition
   evaluation or the execution of actions MUST NOT affect the result of
   the evaluation of other conditions evaluated by the rule engine in
   the same evaluation pass.  That is, an implementation of a rule

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   So, regardless of how a rule engine is implemented, it MUST NOT
   include any side effects of condition evaluation in the evaluation of
   conditions for either of the decision strategies.  For both the
   AllMatching decision strategy and for the nesting of rules within
   rules (either directly or indirectly) where the actions of more than
   one rule may be enforced, any side effects of the enforcement of
   actions MUST NOT be included in condition evaluation on the same
   evaluation pass.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5.3"><h4>5.5.3  Multiple PolicySet Trees For a Resource</h4></a>

   As shown in the example in Figure 3., PolicySet trees are defined by
   the PolicySet subclass instances and the PolicySetComponent
   aggregation instances between them.  Each PolicySet tree has a
   defined set of decision strategies and evaluation priorities.  In
   section 5.6 we discuss some improvements in the use of PolicyRoles
   that cause the parent PolicySet.PolicyRoles to be applied to all
   contained PolicySet instances.  However, a given resource may still
   have multiple, disjoint PolicySet trees regardless of how they are
   collected.  These top-level PolicySet instances are called "unrooted"
   relative to the given resource.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   So, a PolicySet instance is defined to be rooted or unrooted in the
   context of a particular managed element; the relationship to the
   managed element is usually established by the policy roles of the
   PolicySet instance and of the managed element (see 5.6 "Policy
   Roles").  A PolicySet instance is unrooted in that context if and
   only if there is no PolicySetComponent association to a parent
   PolicySet that is also related to the same managed element.  These
   PolicySetComponent aggregations are traversed up the tree without
   regard to how a PolicySet instance came to be related with the
   ManagedElement.  Figure 4. shows an example where instance A has role
   A, instance B has role B and so on.  In this example, in the context
   of interface X, instances B, and C are unrooted and instances D, E,
   and F are all rooted.  In the context of interface Y, instance A is

   Figure 4.    Unrooted PolicySet Instances

   For those cases where there are multiple unrooted PolicySet instances
   that apply to the same managed resource (i.e., not in a common
   PolicySetComponent tree), the decision strategy among these disjoint
   PolicySet instances is the FirstMatching strategy.  The priority used
   with this FirstMatching strategy is defined in the PolicySetInSystem
   association.  The PolicySetInSystem subclass instances are present
   for all PolicySet instances (it is a required association) but the
   priority is only used as a default for unrooted PolicySet instances
   in a given ManagedElement context.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The FirstMatching strategy is used among all unrooted PolicySet
   instances that apply to a given resource for a given functional
   domain.  So, for example, the PolicySet instances that are used for
   QoS policy and the instances that are used for IKE policy, although
   they are disjoint, are not joined in a FirstMatching decision
   strategy.  Instead, they are evaluated independently of one another.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5.4"><h4>5.5.4  Deterministic Decisions</h4></a>

   As previously discussed, PolicySetComponent.Priority values MUST be
   unique within a containing PolicySet and PolicySetInSystem.Priority
   values MUST be unique for an associated System.  Each PolicySet,
   then, has a deterministic behavior based upon the decision strategy
   and uniquely defined priority.
   There are certainly cases where rules need not have a unique priority
   value (i.e., where evaluation and execution priority is not
   important).  However, it is believed that the flexibility gained by
   this capability is not sufficiently beneficial to justify the
   possible variations in implementation behavior and the resulting
   confusion that might occur.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6  Policy Roles</h3></a>

   A policy role is defined in [10] as "an administratively specified

   determine the applicability of the rule/PRC to a particular managed
   element."

   In PCIMe, PolicyRoles is defined as a property of PolicySet, which is
   inherited by both PolicyRules and PolicyGroups.  In this document, we
   also add PolicyRole as the identifying name of a collection of
   resources (PolicyRoleCollection), where each element in the
   collection has the specified role characteristic.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6.1"><h4>5.6.1  Comparison of Roles in PCIM with Roles in snmpconf</h4></a>

   In the Configuration Management with SNMP (snmpconf) working group's
   Policy Based Management MIB [14], policy rules are of the form

      if <policyFilter> then <policyAction>

   where <policyFilter> is a set of conditions that are used to
   determine whether or not the policy applies to an object instance.
   The policy filter can perform comparison operations on SNMP variables
   already defined in MIBS (e.g., "ifType == ethernet").

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The policy management MIB defined in [14] defines a Role table that
   enables one to associate Roles with elements, where roles have the
   same semantics as in PCIM.  Then, since the policyFilter in a policy
   allows one to define conditions based on the comparison of the values
   of SNMP variables, one can filter elements based on their roles as
   defined in the Role group.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This approach differs from that adopted in PCIM in the following
   ways.  First, in PCIM, a set of role(s) is associated with a policy
   rule as the values of the PolicyRoles property of a policy rule.  The
   semantics of role(s) are then expected to be implemented by the PDP
   (i.e., policies are applied to the elements with the appropriate
   roles).  In [14], however, no special processing is required for
   realizing the semantics of roles; roles are treated just as any other
   SNMP variables and comparisons of role values can be included in the
   policy filter of a policy rule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Secondly, in PCIM, there is no formally defined way of associating a
   role with an object instance, whereas in [14] this is done via the
   use of the Role tables (pmRoleESTable and pmRoleSETable).  The Role
   tables associate Role values with elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6.2"><h4>5.6.2  Addition of PolicyRoleCollection to PCIMe</h4></a>

   In order to remedy the latter shortcoming in PCIM (the lack of a way
   of associating a role with an object instance), PCIMe has a new class
   PolicyRoleCollection derived from the CIM Collection class.
   Resources that share a common role are aggregated by a
   PolicyRoleCollection instance, via the ElementInPolicyRoleCollection
   aggregation.  The role is specified in the PolicyRole property of the
   aggregating PolicyRoleCollection instance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PolicyRoleCollection always exists in the context of a system.  As
   was done in PCIM for PolicyRules and PolicyGroups, an association,
   PolicyRoleCollectionInSystem, captures this relationship.  Remember
   that in CIM, System is a base class for describing network devices
   and administrative domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The association between a PolicyRoleCollection and a system should be
   consistent with the associations that scope the policy rules/groups
   that are applied to the resources in that collection.  Specifically,
   a PolicyRoleCollection should be associated with the same System as
   the applicable PolicyRules and/or PolicyGroups, or to a System higher
   in the tree formed by the SystemComponent association.  When a PEP
   belongs to multiple Systems (i.e., AdminDomains), and scoping by a
   single domain is impractical, two alternatives exist.  One is to
   arbitrarily limit domain membership to one System/AdminDomain.  The
   other option is to define a more global AdminDomain that simply
   includes the others, and/or that spans the business or enterprise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As an example, suppose that there are 20 traffic trunks in a network,
   and that an administrator would like to assign three of them to
   provide "gold" service.  Also, the administrator has defined several
   policy rules which specify how the "gold" service is delivered.  For
   these rules, the PolicyRoles property (inherited from PolicySet) is
   set to "Gold Service".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to associate three traffic trunks with "gold" service, an
   instance of the PolicyRoleCollection class is created and its
   PolicyRole property is also set to "Gold Service".  Following this,
   the administrator associates three traffic trunks with the new
   instance of PolicyRoleCollection via the
   ElementInPolicyRoleCollection aggregation.  This enables a PDP to
   determine that the "Gold Service" policy rules apply to the three
   aggregated traffic trunks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that roles are used to optimize policy retrieval.  It is not
   mandatory to implement roles or, if they have been implemented, to
   group elements in a PolicyRoleCollection.  However, if roles are
   used, then either the collection approach should be implemented, or
   elements should be capable of reporting their "pre-programmed" roles
   (as is done in COPS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6.3"><h4>5.6.3  Roles for PolicyGroups</h4></a>

   In PCIM, role(s) are only associated with policy rules.  However, it
   may be desirable to associate role(s) with groups of policy rules.
   For example, a network administrator may want to define a group of
   rules that apply only to Ethernet interfaces.  A policy group can be
   defined with a role-combination="Ethernet", and all the relevant
   policy rules can be placed in this policy group.  (Note that in
   PCIMe, role(s) are made available to PolicyGroups as well as to
   PolicyRules by moving PCIM's PolicyRoles property up from PolicyRule
   to the new abstract class PolicySet.  The property is then inherited
   by both PolicyGroup and PolicyRule.)  Then every policy rule in this
   policy group implicitly inherits this role-combination from the
   containing policy group.  A similar implicit inheritance applies to
   nested policy groups.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is no explicit copying of role(s) from container to contained
   entity.  Obviously, this implicit inheritance of role(s) leads to the
   possibility of defining inconsistent role(s) (as explained in the
   example below); the handling of such inconsistencies is beyond the
   scope of PCIMe.
   As an example, suppose that there is a PolicyGroup PG1 that contains
   three PolicyRules, PR1, PR2, and PR3.  Assume that PG1 has the roles
   "Ethernet" and "Fast".  Also, assume that the contained policy rules
   have the role(s) shown below:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   +------------------------------+

   Figure 5.    Inheritance of Roles

   In this example, the PolicyRoles property value for PR1 is consistent
   with the value in PG1, and in fact, did not need to be redefined. The
   value of PolicyRoles for PR2 is undefined.  Its roles are implicitly
   inherited from PG1.  Lastly, the value of PolicyRoles for PR3 is
   "Slow".  This appears to be in conflict with the role, "Fast,"
   defined in PG1.  However, whether these roles are actually in
   conflict is not clear.   In one scenario, the policy administrator
   may have wanted only "Fast"- "Ethernet" rules in the policy group.
   In another scenario, the administrator may be indicating that PR3
   applies to all "Ethernet" interfaces regardless of whether they are
   "Fast" or "Slow."  Only in the former scenario (only "Fast"-
   "Ethernet" rules in the policy group) is there a role conflict.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that it is possible to override implicitly inherited roles via

   A compound action is a convenient construct to represent a sequence

   looked upon as sub-actions of one "logical" action.  An example of
   such a logical action is "shape & mark" (i.e., shape a certain stream
   to a set of predefined bandwidth characteristics and then mark these
   packets with a certain DSCP value).  This logical action is actually
   composed of two different QoS actions, which should be performed in a
   well-defined order and as a complete set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The CompoundPolicyAction construct allows one to create a logical
   relationship between a number of actions, and to define the

      aggregated by a PolicyRule or by a CompoundPolicyAction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.8"><h3>5.8  Variables and Values</h3></a>

   The following subsections introduce several related concepts,
   including PolicyVariables and PolicyValues (and their numerous
   subclasses), SimplePolicyConditions, and SimplePolicyActions.
	<a name="section-5.8.1"><h4>5.8.1  Simple Policy Conditions</h4></a>

   The SimplePolicyCondition class models elementary Boolean expressions
   of the form: "(<variable> MATCH <value>)".  The relationship 'MATCH',
   which is implicit in the model, is interpreted based on the variable
   and the value.  Section 5.8.3 explains the semantics of the 'MATCH'
   operator.  Arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions can be formed by
   chaining together any number of simple conditions using relational
   operators.  Individual simple conditions can be negated as well.
   Arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions are modeled by the class
   CompoundPolicyCondition (described in Section 5.7.1).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, the expression "SourcePort == 80" can be modeled by a
   simple condition.  In this example, 'SourcePort' is a variable, '=='
   is the relational operator denoting the equality relationship (which
   is generalized by PCIMe to a "MATCH" relationship), and '80' is an
   integer value.  The complete interpretation of a simple condition
   depends on the binding of the variable.  Section 5.8.5 describes
   variables and their binding rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SimplePolicyCondition class refines the basic structure of the
   PolicyCondition class defined in PCIM by using the pair (<variable>,
   <value>) to form the condition.  Note that the operator between the
   variable and the value is always implied in PCIMe: it is not a part
   of the formal notation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The variable specifies the attribute of an object that should be
   matched when evaluating the condition.  For example, for a QoS model,
   this object could represent the flow that is being conditioned.  A
   set of predefined variables that cover network attributes commonly
   used for filtering is introduced in PCIMe, to encourage
   interoperability.  This list covers layer 3 IP attributes such as IP
   network addresses, protocols and ports, as well as a set of layer 2
   attributes (e.g., MAC addresses).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The bound variable is matched against a value to produce the Boolean
   result.  For example, in the condition "The source IP address of the
   flow belongs to the 10.1.x.x subnet", a source IP address variable is
   matched against a 10.1.x.x subnet value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.8.2"><h4>5.8.2  Using Simple Policy Conditions</h4></a>

   Simple conditions can be used in policy rules directly, or as
   building blocks for creating compound policy conditions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Simple condition composition MUST enforce the following data-type
   conformance rule: The ValueTypes property of the variable must be
   compatible with the type of the value class used.  The simplest (and
   friendliest, from a user point-of-view) way to do this is to equate
   the type of the value class with the name of the class.  By ensuring
   that the ValueTypes property of the variable matches the name of the
   value class used, we know that the variable and value instance values
   are compatible with each other.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Composing a simple condition requires that an instance of the class
   SimplePolicyCondition be created, and that instances of the variable
   and value classes that it uses also exist.  Note that the variable
   and/or value instances may already exist as reusable objects in an
   appropriate ReusablePolicyContainer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two aggregations are used in order to create the pair (<variable>,

   a SimplePolicyCondition to a single value instance.  Both

	<a name="section-5.8.3"><h4>5.8.3  The Simple Condition Operator</h4></a>

   A simple condition models an elementary Boolean expression of the
   form "variable MATCHes value".  However, the formal notation of the
   SimplePolicyCondition, together with its associations, models only a
   pair, (<variable>, <value>).  The 'MATCH' operator is not directly
   modeled -- it is implied.  Furthermore, this implied 'MATCH' operator
   carries overloaded semantics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, in the simple condition "DestinationPort MATCH '80'",
   the interpretation of the 'MATCH' operator is equality (the 'equal'
   operator).  Clearly, a different interpretation is needed in the
   following cases:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  "DestinationPort MATCH {'80', '8080'}"  -- operator is 'IS SET
      MEMBER'

   o  "DestinationPort MATCH {'1 to 255'}" -- operator is 'IN INTEGER
      RANGE'

   o  "SourceIPAddress MATCH 'MyCompany.com'" -- operator is 'IP ADDRESS
      AS RESOLVED BY DNS'

   The examples above illustrate the implicit, context-dependent nature
   of the 'MATCH' operator.  The interpretation depends on the actual
   variable and value instances in the simple condition.  The
   interpretation is always derived from the bound variable and the
   value instance associated with the simple condition.  Text
   accompanying the value class and implicit variable definition is used
   for interpreting the semantics of the 'MATCH' relationship.  In the
   following list, we define generic (type-independent) matching.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PolicyValues may be multi-fielded, where each field may contain a
   range of values.  The same equally holds for PolicyVariables.
   Basically, we have to deal with single values (singleton), ranges
   ([lower bound ..  upper bound]), and sets (a,b,c).  So independent of
   the variable and value type, the following set of generic matching
   rules for the 'MATCH' operator are defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  singleton matches singleton -> the matching rule is defined in the
      type

   o  singleton matches range [lower bound .. upper bound] -> the
      matching evaluates to true, if the singleton matches the lower
      bound or the upper bound or a value in between
   o  singleton matches set -> the matching evaluates to true, if the
      value of the singleton matches one of the components in the set,
      where a component may be a singleton or range again

   o  ranges [A..B] matches singleton -> is true if A matches B matches
      singleton

   o  range [A..B] matches range [X..Y] -> the matching evaluates to
      true, if all values of the range [A..B] are also in the range
      [X..Y].  For instance, [3..5] match [1..6] evaluates to true,
      whereas [3..5] match [4..6] evaluates to false.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  range [A..B] matches set (a,b,c, ...) -> the matching evaluates to
      true, if all values in the range [A..B] are part of the set.  For
      instance, range [2..3] match set ([1..2],3) evaluates to true, as
      well as range [2..3] match set (2,3), and range [2..3] match set
      ([1..2],[3..5]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  set (a,b,c, ...) match singleton -> is true if a match b match c
      match ... match singleton

   o  set match range -> the matching evaluates to true, if all values
      in the set are part of the range.  For example, set (2,3) match
      range [1..4] evaluates to true.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  set (a,b,c,...) match set (x,y,z,...) -> the matching evaluates to
      true, if all values in the set (a,b,c,...) are part of the set
      (x,y,z,...).  For example, set (1,2,3) match set (1,2,3,4)
      evaluates to true.  Set (1,2,3) match set (1,2) evaluates to
      false.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Variables may contain various types (Section 6.11.1).  When not
   stated otherwise, the type of the value bound to the variable at
   condition evaluation time and the value type of the PolicyValue
   instance need to be of the same type.  If they differ, then the
   condition evaluates to FALSE.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association specifies an expected
   set of values that can be matched with a variable within a simple
   condition.  Using this association, a source or destination port can
   be limited to the range 0-200, a source or destination IP address can
   be limited to a specified list of IPv4 address values, etc.

   Figure 7.    An Invalid SimplePolicyCondition

   The ability to express these limitations appears in the model to
   support validation of a SimplePolicyCondition prior to its deployment
   to an enforcement point.  A Policy Management Tool, for example
   SHOULD NOT accept the SimplePolicyCondition shown in Figure 7.  If,
   however, a policy rule containing this condition does appear at an
   enforcement point, the expected values play no role in the
   determination of whether the condition evaluates to True or False.
   Thus in this example, the SimplePolicyCondition evaluates to True if
   the source port for the packet under consideration is 300, and it
   evaluates to False otherwise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.8.4"><h4>5.8.4  SimplePolicyActions</h4></a>

   The SimplePolicyAction class models the elementary set operation.
   "SET <variable> TO <value>".  The set operator MUST overwrite an old
   value of the variable.  In the case where the variable to be updated
   is multi- valued, the only update operation defined is a complete
   replacement of all previous values with a new set.  In other words,
   there are no Add or Remove [to/from the set of values] operations
   defined for SimplePolicyActions.
   For example, the action  "set DSCP to EF" can be modeled by a simple
   action.  In this example, 'DSCP' is an implicit variable referring to
   the IP packet header DSCP field.  'EF' is an integer or bit string
   value (6 bits).  The complete interpretation of a simple action
   depends on the binding of the variable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The SimplePolicyAction class refines the basic structure of the
   PolicyAction class defined in PCIM, by specifying the contents of the
   action using the (<variable>, <value>) pair to form the action.  The
   variable specifies the attribute of an object. The value of  this
   attribute is set to the value specified in <value>.  Selection of the
   object is a function of the type of variable involved.  See Sections
   5.8.6 and 5.8.7, respectively, for details on object selection for
   explicitly bound and implicitly bound policy variables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SimplePolicyActions can be used in policy rules directly, or as

   of IPv4Address type may not be set to a string containing a DNS name.
   Conversions are part of an implementation-specific mapping of the

	<a name="section-5.8.5"><h4>5.8.5  Policy Variables</h4></a>

   A variable generically represents information that changes (or
   "varies"), and that is set or evaluated by software.  In policy,
   conditions and actions can abstract information as "policy variables"
   to be evaluated in logical expressions, or set by actions.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PCIMe defines two types of PolicyVariables, PolicyImplicitVariables
   and PolicyExplicitVariables.  The semantic difference between these
   classes is based on modeling context.  Explicit variables are bound
   to exact model constructs, while implicit variables are defined and
   evaluated outside of a model.  For example, one can imagine a
   PolicyCondition testing whether a CIM ManagedSystemElement's Status
   property has the value "Error."  The Status property is an explicitly
   defined PolicyVariable (i.e., it is defined in the context of the CIM
   Schema, and evaluated in the context of a specific instance).  On the
   other hand, network packets are not explicitly modeled or
   instantiated, since there is no perceived value (at this time) in
   managing at the packet level.  Therefore, a PolicyCondition can make
   no explicit reference to a model construct that represents a network
   packet's source address.  In this case, an implicit PolicyVariable is
   defined, to allow evaluation or modification of a packet's source
   address.
	<a name="section-5.8.6"><h4>5.8.6  Explicitly Bound Policy Variables</h4></a>

   Explicitly bound policy variables indicate the class and property
   names of the model construct to be evaluated or set.  The CIM Schema
   defines and constrains "appropriate" values for the variable (i.e.,
   model property) using data types and other information such as
   class/property qualifiers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A PolicyExplicitVariable is "explicit" because its model semantics
   are exactly defined.  It is NOT explicit due to an exact binding to a
   particular object instance.  If PolicyExplicitVariables were tied to
   instances (either via associations or by an object identification
   property in the class itself), then we would be forcing element-
   specific rules.  On the other hand, if we only specify the object's
   model context (class and property name), but leave the binding to the
   policy framework (for example, using policy roles), then greater
   flexibility results for either general or element-specific rules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, an element-specific rule is obtained by a condition
   ((<variable>, <value>) pair) that defines CIM LogicalDevice
   DeviceID="12345".  Alternately, if a PolicyRule's PolicyRoles is
   "edge device" and the condition ((<variable>, <value>) pair) is
   Status="Error", then a general rule results for all edge devices in
   error.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Currently, the only binding for a PolicyExplicitVariable defined in
   PCIMe is to the instances selected by policy roles.  For each such
   instance, a SimplePolicyCondition that aggregates the
   PolicyExplicitVariable evaluates to True if and only if ALL of the
   following are true:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The instance selected is of the class identified by the variable's
      ModelClass property, or of a subclass of this class.
   o  The instance selected has the property identified by the
      variable's ModelProperty property.
   o  The value of this property in the instance matches the value
      specified in the PolicyValue aggregated by the condition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In all other cases, the SimplePolicyCondition evaluates to False.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the case where a SimplePolicyAction aggregates a
   PolicyExplicitVariable, the indicated property in the selected
   instance is set to the value represented by the PolicyValue that the
   SimplePolicyAction also aggregates.  However, if the selected
   instance is not of the class identified by the variable's ModelClass
   property, or of a subclass of this class, then the action is not
   performed.  In this case the SimplePolicyAction is not treated either
   as a successfully executed action (for the execution strategy Do
   Until Success) or as a failed action (for the execution strategy Do
   Until Failure).  Instead, the remaining actions for the policy rule,
   if any, are executed as if this SimplePolicyAction were not present
   at all in the list of actions aggregated by the rule.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Explicit variables would be more powerful if they could reach beyond
   the instances selected by policy roles, to related instances.
   However, to represent a policy rule involving such variables in any
   kind of general way requires something that starts to resemble very
   much a complete policy language.  Clearly such a language is outside
   the scope of PCIMe, although it might be the subject of a future
   document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   By restricting much of the generality, it would be possible for
   explicit variables in PCIMe to reach slightly beyond a selected
   instance.  For example, if a selected instance were related to
   exactly one instance of another class via a particular association
   class, and if the goal of the policy rule were both to test a
   property of this related instance and to set a property of that same
   instance, then it would be possible to represent the condition and
   action of the rule using PolicyExplicitVariables.  Rather than
   handling this one specific case with explicit variables, though, it
   was decided to lump them with the more general case, and deal with
   them if and when a policy language is defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.8.7"><h4>5.8.7  Implicitly Bound Policy Variables</h4></a>

   Implicitly bound policy variables define the data type and semantics
   of a variable.  This determines how the variable is bound to a value
   in a condition or an action.  Further instructions are provided for
   specifying data type and/or value constraints for implicitly bound
   variables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PCIMe introduces an abstract class, PolicyImplicitVariable, to model
   implicitly bound variables.  This class is derived from the abstract
   class PolicyVariable also defined in PCIMe.  Each of the implicitly

   domain- specific sub-models) MUST be derived from the
   PolicyImplicitVariable class.  The rationale for using this mechanism
   for modeling is explained below in Section 5.8.9.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A domain-specific policy information model that extends PCIMe may
   define additional implicitly bound variables either by deriving them
   directly from the class PolicyImplicitVariable, or by further
   refining an existing variable class such as SourcePort.  When

   value constraints may be narrowed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.8.8"><h4>5.8.8  Structure and Usage of Pre-Defined Variables</h4></a>

   A class derived from PolicyImplicitVariable to model a particular
   implicitly bound variable SHOULD be constructed so that its name
   depicts the meaning of the variable.  For example, a class defined to
   model the source port of a TCP/UDP flow SHOULD have 'SourcePort' in

      value classes that could be matched to this variable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. The list of constraints on the values that the PolicyVariable can
      hold (i.e., values that the variable must match) are defined by
      the appropriate properties of an associated PolicyValue class.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the example presented above, a PolicyImplicitVariable represents
   the SourcePort of incoming traffic.  The ValueTypes property of an
   instance of this class will hold the class name PolicyIntegerValue.
   This by itself constrains the data type of the SourcePort instance to
   be an integer.  However, we can further constrain the particular
   values that the SourcePort variable can hold by entering valid ranges
   in the IntegerList property of the PolicyIntegerValue instance (0 -
   65535 in this document).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The combination of the VariableName and the
   ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association provide a consistent and
   extensible set of metadata that define the semantics of variables
   that are used to form policy conditions.  Since the
   ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association points to a PolicyValue
   instance, any of the values expressible in the PolicyValue class can
   be used to constrain values that the PolicyImplicitVariable can hold.
   For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  The ValueTypes property can be used to ensure that only proper
      classes are used in the expression.  For example, the SourcePort
      variable will not be allowed to ever be of type
      PolicyIPv4AddrValue, since source ports have different semantics
      than IP addresses and may not be matched.  However, integer value
      types are allowed as the property ValueTypes holds the string
      "PolicyIntegerValue", which is the class name for integer values.
   o  The ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association also ensures that
      variable-specific semantics are enforced (e.g., the SourcePort
      variable may include a constraint association to a value object
      defining a specific integer range that should be matched).

	<a name="section-5.9"><h3>5.9  Packet Filtering</h3></a>

   PCIMe contains two mechanisms for representing packet filters.  The
   more general of these, termed here the domain-level model, expresses
   packet filters in terms of policy variables and policy values.  The
   other mechanism, termed here the device-level model, expresses packet
   filters in a way that maps more directly to the packet fields to
   which the filters are being applied.  While it is possible to map
   between these two representations of packet filters, no mapping is
   provided in PCIMe itself.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.9.1"><h4>5.9.1  Domain-Level Packet Filters</h4></a>

   In addition to filling in the holes in the overall Policy
   infrastructure, PCIMe proposes a single mechanism for expressing
   domain-level packet filters in policy conditions.  This is being done
   in response to concerns that even though the initial "wave" of
   submodels derived from PCIM were all filtering on IP packets, each
   was doing it in a slightly different way.  PCIMe proposes a common
   way to express IP packet filters.  The following figure illustrates
   how packet-filtering conditions are expressed in PCIMe.

   Figure 9.    Packet Filtering in Policy Conditions

   In Figure 9., each SimplePolicyCondition represents a single field to
   be filtered on: Source IP address, Destination IP address, Source
   port, etc.  An additional SimplePolicyCondition indicates the
   direction that a packet is traveling on an interface: inbound or
   outbound.  Because of the FlowDirection condition, care must be taken
   in aggregating a set of SimplePolicyConditions into a
   CompoundFilterCondition.  Otherwise, the resulting
   CompoundPolicyCondition may match all inbound packets, or all
   outbound packets, when this is probably not what was intended.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Individual SimplePolicyConditions may be negated when they are
   aggregated by a CompoundFilterCondition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   CompoundFilterCondition is a subclass of CompoundPolicyCondition.  It
   introduces one additional property, the Boolean property IsMirrored.
   The purpose of this property is to allow a single
   CompoundFilterCondition to match packets traveling in both directions
   on a higher-level connection such as a TCP session.  When this
   property is TRUE, additional packets match a filter, beyond those
   that would ordinarily match it.  An example will illustrate how this
   property works.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Suppose we have a CompoundFilterCondition that aggregates the

      o   Source Port = 80

   Regardless of whether IsMirrored is TRUE or FALSE, inbound packets
   will match this CompoundFilterCondition if their Source IP address =
   9.1.1.1 and their Source port = 80.  If IsMirrored is TRUE, however,
   an outbound packet will also match the CompoundFilterCondition if its
   Destination IP address = 9.1.1.1 and its Destination port = 80.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.9.2"><h4>5.9.2  Device-Level Packet Filters</h4></a>

   At the device level, packet header filters are represented by two
   subclasses of the abstract class FilterEntryBase: IpHeadersFilter and
   8021Filter.  Submodels of PCIMe may define other subclasses of
   FilterEntryBase in addition to these two; ICPM [12], for example,
   defines subclasses for IPsec-specific filters.
   Instances of the subclasses of FilterEntryBase are not used directly
   as filters.  They are always aggregated into a FilterList, by the
   aggregation EntriesInFilterList.  For PCIMe and its submodels, the
   EntrySequence property in this aggregation always takes its default
   value '0', indicating that the aggregated filter entries are ANDed
   together.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The FilterList class includes an enumeration property Direction,
   representing the direction of the traffic flow to which the

   CompoundFilterCondition.  See Section 5.9.1 for details.

   Because PCIM and PCIMe provide the core classes for modeling
   policies, they are not in general sufficient by themselves for
   representing actual policy rules.  Submodels, such as QPIM and ICPM,
   provide the means for expressing policy rules, by defining subclasses
   of the classes defined in PCIM and PCIMe, and/or by indicating how
   the PolicyVariables and PolicyValues defined in PCIMe can be used to
   express conditions and actions applicable to the submodel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A particular submodel will not, in general, need to use every element
   defined in PCIM and PCIMe.  For the elements it does not use, a

   support the element, must not support the element, should support the
   element, etc.  For the elements it does use, a submodel SHOULD
   indicate which elements its implementations must support, which
   elements they should support, and which elements they may support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PCIM and PCIMe themselves simply define elements that may be of use

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This model (and derived submodels) defines conditions and actions

   supported, as submodels are developed it is likely that situations
   will arise in which specific conditions or actions are not supported
   by some part of the policy execution system.  Similarly, situations
   may also occur where rules contain syntactic or semantic errors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be understood that the behavior and effect of undefined or
   incorrectly defined conditions or actions is not prescribed by this
   information model.  While it would be helpful if it were prescribed,
   the variations in implementation restrict the ability for this

   implementation only detected that a PEP could not enforce a given
   action on that PEP, it would be very difficult to declare that such a
   failure should affect other PEPs, or the PDP process.  On the other
   hand, if the PDP determines that it cannot properly evaluate a

   Variables are used for building individual conditions.  The variable
   specifies the property of a flow or an event that should be matched
   when evaluating the condition.  However, not every combination of a
   variable and a value creates a meaningful condition.  For example, a
   source IP address variable can not be matched against a value that
   specifies a port number.  A given variable selects the set of
   matchable value types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A variable can have constraints that limit the set of values within a
   particular value type that can be matched against it in a condition.
   For example, a source-port variable limits the set of values to
   represent integers to the range of 0-65535.  Integers outside this
   range cannot be matched to the source-port variable, even though they
   are of the correct data type.  Constraints for a given variable are
   indicated through the ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The PolicyVariable is an abstract class.  Implicit and explicit

   The property IntegerList provides an unordered list of integers and

   Using this association, a variable (instance) may be constrained to
   be bound- to/assigned only a set of allowed values.  For example,
