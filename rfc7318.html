	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document introduces policy qualifiers in the certificate
   policies extension of the RPKI resource certificates.  This document
   updates [RFC6487].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Update to RFC 6487</h2></a>

   [RFC6487] profiles certificates, certificate revocation lists, and
   certificate signing requests specified in [RFC5280] for use in
   routing public key infrastructure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC5280] defines an extension to certificates for the listing of
   policy information (see Section 4.2.1.4).  [RFC6487] states in
   Section 4.8.9: "This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked
   critical.  It MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the
   RPKI CP [RFC6484]".  This references the CertPolicyId of the sequence
   allowed in PolicyInformation as defined by [RFC5280].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC5280] also specifies that PolicyInformation may optionally have a
   sequence of PolicyQualifierInfo objects.  [RFC6487] does not
   specifically allow or disallow these PolicyQualifierInfo objects,
   although Section 4 also states: "Unless specifically noted as being
   OPTIONAL, all the fields listed here MUST be present, and any other
   fields MUST NOT appear in a conforming resource certificate."
   Because there is a need for some RPKI Certificate Authorities to
   include policy qualifiers in their certificates, this document
   updates Section 4.8.9 of [RFC6487] as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      OLD:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It
         MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI
         Certificate Policy (CP) [RFC6484].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      NEW:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It
         MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP
         [RFC6484].  Exactly one policy qualifier MAY be included.  If a
         policy qualifier is included, the policyQualifierId MUST be the
         Certification Practice Statement (CPS) pointer qualifier type
         (id-qt-cps).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As noted in [RFC5280], Section 4.2.1.4: "Optional qualifiers, which
   MAY be present, are not expected to change the definition of the
   policy."  In this case, any optional policy qualifier that MAY be
   present in a resource certificate MUST NOT change the definition of
   the RPKI CP [RFC6484].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The Security Considerations of [RFC6487] apply to this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document updates the RPKI certificate profile to specify that
   the certificate policies extension can include a policy qualifier,
   which is a URI.  While dereferencing the URI is not required for
   certificate validation, doing so could provide a denial-of-service
   (DoS) vector, where the target host may be subjected to bogus work
   dereferencing the URI.  However, this specification, like [RFC5280],
   places no processing requirements on the URI included in the
   qualifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As an update to [RFC6487], this document broadens the class of
   certificates that conform to the RPKI profile by explicitly including
   within the profile those certificates that contain a policy qualifier
   as described here.  A relying party that performs a strict validation
   based on [RFC6487] and fails to support the updates described in this
   document would incorrectly invalidate RPKI objects that include the
   changes in Section 2.
	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Acknowledgments</h2></a>

   Frank Hill and Adam Guyot helped define the scope of the issue
   covered by this document and identified and worked with RPKI
   validator implementers to clarify the use of policy qualifiers in
   resource certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Sean Turner provided significant text to this document regarding the
   processing of the CPS URI and limiting the scope of the allowable
   content of the policy qualifier.
