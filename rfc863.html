                            Discard Protocol




This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on
the ARPA Internet that choose to implement a Discard Protocol are
expected to adopt and implement this standard.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">A useful debugging and measurement tool is a discard service.  A discard
service simply throws away any data it receives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">TCP Based Discard Service

   One discard service is defined as a connection based application on
   TCP.  A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 9.  Once a
   connection is established any data received is thrown away.  No
   response is sent.  This continues until the calling user terminates
   the connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">UDP Based Discard Service

   Another discard service is defined as a datagram based application on
   UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port 9.  When a
   datagram is received, it is thrown away.  No response is sent.
