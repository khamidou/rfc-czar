	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The SIP events framework [RFC3265] defines a generic framework for
   subscriptions to and notifications of events related to SIP systems.
   This framework defines the methods SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, and
   introduces the concept of an event package, which is a concrete
   application of the SIP events framework to a particular class of
   events.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One of the things the SIP events framework mandates is that each
   event package specification defines an absolute maximum on the rate
   at which notifications are allowed to be generated by a single
   notifier.  Such a limit is provided in order to reduce network load.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All of the existing event package specifications include a
   recommendation for the maximum notification rate, ranging from once
   in every five seconds [RFC3856], [RFC3680], [RFC3857] to once per
   second [RFC3842].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Per the SIP events framework, each event package specification is
   allowed to define additional throttle mechanisms that allow the
   subscriber to further limit the rate of event notification.  So far,
   none of the event package specifications have defined such a
   mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The resource list extension [RFC4662] to the SIP events framework
   also deals with rate limiting of event notifications.  The extension
   allows a subscriber to subscribe to a heterogeneous list of resources
   with a single SUBSCRIBE request, rather than having to install a
   subscription for each resource separately.  The event list
   subscription also allows rate limiting, or throttling of
   notifications, by means of the Resource List Server (RLS) buffering
   notifications of resource state changes, and sending them in batches.
   However, the event list mechanism provides no means for the
   subscriber to set the interval for the throttling.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some event packages are also interested in specifying an absolute or
   an adaptive minimum rate at which notifications need to be generated
   by a notifier.  This helps the subscriber to effectively use
   different trigger criteria within a subscription to eliminate
   unnecessary notifications but at the same time make sure that the
   current event state is periodically received.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines an extension to the SIP events framework by
   defining the following three Event header field parameters that allow
   a subscriber to set a maximum, a minimum, and an adaptive minimum
   rate of notifications generated by the notifier:
   max-rate:  specifies a maximum number of notifications per second.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   min-rate:  specifies a minimum number of notifications per second.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   adaptive-min-rate:  specifies an adaptive minimum number of
      notifications per second.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These mechanisms are applicable to any event subscription, both
   single event subscription and event list subscription.  A notifier
   compliant to this specification will adjust the rate at which it
   generates notifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Overview</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Use Case for Limiting the Maximum Rate of Notifications</h3></a>

   A presence client in a mobile device contains a list of 100 buddies
   or presentities.  In order to decrease the processing and network
   load of watching 100 presentities, the presence client has employed
   an RLS with the list of buddies, and therefore only needs a single
   subscription to the RLS to receive notifications of the presence
   state of the resource list.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In order to control the buffer policy of the RLS, the presence client
   sets a maximum rate of notifications.  The RLS will buffer
   notifications that are generated faster than they are allowed to be
   sent due to the maximum rate and batch all of the buffered state
   changes together in a single notification.  The maximum rate applies
   to the overall resource list, which means that there is a hard cap
   imposed by the maximum rate to the number of notifications per second
   that the presence client can expect to receive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The presence client can also modify the maximum rate of notifications
   during the lifetime of the subscription.  For example, if the mobile
   device detects inactivity from the user for a period of time, the
   presence client can simply pause notifications by choosing a "max-
   rate" parameter that allows only a single notification for the
   remainder of the subscription lifetime.  When the user becomes active
   again, the presence client can resume the stream of notifications by
   re-subscribing with a "max-rate" parameter set to the earlier-used
   value.  Application of the mechanism defined by RFC 5839 [RFC5839]
   can also eliminate the transmission of a (full-state) notification
   carrying the latest resource state to the presence client after a
   subscription refresh.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Use Case for Setting a Minimum Rate for Notifications</h3></a>

   A location application is monitoring the movement of a target.  In
   order to decrease the processing and network load, the location
   application has made a subscription to a Location Server with a set
   of location filters [RFC6447] that specify trigger criteria, e.g., to
   send an update only when the target has moved at least n meters.
   However, the application is also interested in receiving the current
   state periodically, even if the state of the target has not changed
   enough to satisfy any of the trigger criteria, e.g., has not moved at
   least n meters within the period.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The location application sets a minimum rate of notifications and
   includes it in the subscription sent to the Location Server. The
   "min-rate" parameter indicates the minimum number of notifications
   per second the notifier needs to generate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The location application can modify the minimum rate of notifications
   during the lifetime of the subscription.  For example, when the
   subscription to the movement of a target is made, the notifier may
   not have the location information available.  Thus, the first
   notification might be empty or certain values might be absent.  An
   important use case is placing constraints on when complete state
   should be provided after creating the subscription.  Once state is
   acquired and the second notification is sent, the subscriber updates
   or changes the "min-rate" parameter to a more sensible value.  This
   update can be performed in the response to the notification that
   contains the complete state information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Use Case for Specifying an Adaptive Minimum Rate of Notifications</h3></a>

   The minimum rate mechanism introduces a static and instantaneous rate
   control without the functionality to increase or decrease the
   notification rate adaptively.  However, there are some applications
   that would work better with an adaptive minimum rate control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A location application is monitoring the movement of a target.  In
   order to decrease the processing in the application, the location
   application wants to make a subscription that dynamically decreases
   the minimum rate of notifications if the target has sent out several
   notifications recently.  However, if there have been only few recent
   notifications by the target, the location application wants the
   minimum rate of notifications to increase.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The location application sets an adaptive minimum rate of
   notifications and includes it in the subscription sent to the
   Location Server.  The "adaptive-min-rate" parameter value is used by
   the notifier to dynamically calculate the actual maximum time between
   two notifications.  In order to dynamically calculate the maximum
   time, the notifier takes into consideration the rate at which
   notifications have been sent recently.  In the adaptive minimum rate
   mechanism, the notifier can increase or decrease the notification
   rate compared to the minimum rate mechanism based on the recent
   number of notifications sent out in the last period.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The location application can also modify the "adaptive-min-rate"
   parameter during the lifetime of the subscription.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Requirements</h3></a>

   REQ1:   The subscriber must be able to set a maximum rate of
           notifications in a specific subscription.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ2:   The subscriber must be able to set a minimum rate of
           notifications in a specific subscription.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ3:   The subscriber must be able to set an adaptive minimum rate
           of notifications in a specific subscription, which adjusts
           the minimum rate of notifications based on a moving average.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ4:   It must be possible to apply the maximum rate, the minimum
           rate, and the adaptive minimum rate mechanisms all together,
           or in any combination, in a specific subscription.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ5:   It must be possible to use any of the different rate control
           mechanisms in subscriptions to any events.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ6:   It must be possible to use any of the different rate control
           mechanisms together with any other event filtering
           mechanisms.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ7:   The notifier must be allowed to use a policy in which the
           maximum rate, minimum rate, and adaptive minimum rate
           parameters are adjusted from the value given by the
           subscriber.
              For example, due to congestion, local policy at the
              notifier could temporarily dictate a policy that in effect
              further decreases the maximum rate of notifications.  In
              another example, the notifier could increase the
              subscriber-proposed maximum rate so that at least one
              notification is generated during the remainder of the
              subscription lifetime.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ8:   The different rate control mechanisms must address corner
           cases for setting the notification rates appropriately.  At a
           minimum, the mechanisms must address the situation in which
           the time between two notifications exceeds the subscription
           duration and should provide procedures for avoiding this
           situation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ9:   It must be possible to invoke, modify, or remove the
           different rate control mechanisms in the course of an active
           subscription.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   REQ10:  The different rate control mechanisms must allow for the
           application of authentication and integrity protection
           mechanisms to subscriptions invoking that mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Basic Operations</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Subscriber Behavior</h3></a>

   In general, a subscriber generates SUBSCRIBE requests and processes
   NOTIFY requests as described in RFC 3265 [RFC3265].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A subscriber that wants to have a maximum, minimum, or adaptive
   minimum rate of event notifications in a specific event subscription
   does so by including a "max-rate", "min-rate", or "adaptive-min-rate"
   Event header field parameter(s) as part of the SUBSCRIBE request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A subscriber that wants to update a previously agreed event rate
   control parameter does so by including the updated "max-rate", "min-
   rate", or "adaptive-min-rate" Event header field parameter(s) as part
   of a subsequent SUBSCRIBE request or a 2xx response to the NOTIFY
   request.  If the subscriber does not include at least one of the
   "max-rate", "min-rate", or "adaptive-min-rate" header field
   parameters in the most recent SUBSCRIBE request in a given dialog,
   the subscriber MUST NOT include an Event header field with any of
   those parameters in a 2xx response to a NOTIFY request in that
   dialog.
	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Notifier Behavior</h3></a>

   In general, a notifier processes SUBSCRIBE requests and generates
   NOTIFY requests as described in RFC 3265 [RFC3265].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A notifier that supports the different rate control mechanisms MUST
   adjust its rate of notification according to the rate control values
   agreed with the subscriber.  If the notifier needs to lower the
   subscription expiration value, or if a local policy or other
   implementation-determined constraint at the notifier cannot satisfy
   the rate control request, then the notifier can adjust (i.e.,
   increase or decrease) appropriately the subscriber-requested rate
   control values.  The notifier MUST reflect back the possibly adjusted
   rate control values in a "max-rate", "min-rate", or "adaptive-min-
   rate" Subscription-State header field parameter of the subsequent
   NOTIFY requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Operation of the Maximum Rate Mechanism</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Subscriber Behavior</h3></a>

   A subscriber that wishes to apply a maximum rate to notifications in
   a subscription MUST construct a SUBSCRIBE request that includes the
   "max-rate" Event header field parameter.  This parameter specifies
   the requested maximum number of notifications per second.  The value
   of this parameter is a positive real number given by a finite decimal
   representation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that the grammar in section 9.2 constrains this value to be
      between 0.0000000001 and 99.9999999999.  Zero is not an allowed
      value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that the witnessed notification rate may not conform to the
      "max-rate" value for a number of reasons.  For example, network
      jitter and retransmissions may result in the subscriber receiving
      the notifications more frequently than the "max-rate" value
      recommends.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A subscriber that wishes to update the previously agreed maximum rate
   of notifications MUST include the updated "max-rate" Event header
   field parameter in a subsequent SUBSCRIBE request or a 2xx response
   to the NOTIFY request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A subscriber that wishes to remove the maximum rate control from
   notifications MUST indicate so by not including a "max-rate" Event
   header field parameter in a subsequent SUBSCRIBE request or a 2xx
   response to the NOTIFY request.
   There are two main consequences for the subscriber when applying the
   maximum rate mechanism: state transitions may be lost and event
   notifications may be delayed.  If either of these side effects
   constitute a problem to the application that utilizes the event
   notifications, developers are instructed not to use the mechanism.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Notifier Behavior</h3></a>

   A notifier that supports the maximum rate mechanism MUST extract the
   value of the "max-rate" Event header parameter from a SUBSCRIBE
   request or a 2xx response to the NOTIFY request and use it as the
   suggested maximum number of notifications per second.  This value can
   be adjusted by the notifier, as defined in Section 5.3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A compliant notifier MUST reflect back the possibly adjusted maximum
   rate of notifications in a "max-rate" Subscription-State header field
   parameter of the subsequent NOTIFY requests.  The indicated "max-
   rate" value is adopted by the notifier, and the notification rate is
   adjusted accordingly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A notifier that does not understand this extension will not reflect
   the "max-rate" Subscription-State header field parameter in the
   NOTIFY requests; the absence of this parameter indicates to the
   subscriber that no rate control is supported by the notifier.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A compliant notifier MUST NOT generate a notification if the interval
   since the most recent notification is less than the reciprocal value
   of the "max-rate" parameter, except when generating the notification
   either upon receipt of a SUBSCRIBE request, when the subscription
   state is changing from "pending" to "active" state, or upon
   termination of the subscription (the last notification).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a local policy dictates a maximum rate for notifications, a
   notifier will not generate notifications more frequently than the
   local policy maximum rate, even if the subscriber is not asking for
   maximum rate control.  The notifier MAY inform the subscriber about
   such a local policy maximum rate using the "max-rate" Subscription-
   State header field parameter included in subsequent NOTIFY requests.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Retransmissions of NOTIFY requests are not affected by the maximum
   rate mechanism, i.e., the maximum rate mechanism only applies to the
   generation of new transactions.  In other words, the maximum rate
   mechanism does not in any way break or modify the normal
   retransmission mechanism specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].
	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Selecting the Maximum Rate</h3></a>

   Special care needs to be taken when selecting the maximum rate.  For
   example, the maximum rate could potentially set a minimum time value
   between notifications that exceeds the subscription expiration value.
   Such a configuration would effectively quench the notifier, resulting
   in exactly two notifications being generated.  If the subscriber

   maximum rate applies to the aggregate notification stream resulting
   from the list subscription, rather than explicitly controlling the
   notification of each of the implied constituent events.  Moreover,

         Figure 1: Model for the RLS Supporting Event Rate Control

   In short, the RLS reads event state changes from the event state
   resource, either by creating a back-end subscription or by other
   means; it packages them into event notifications and submits them
   into the output buffer.  The rate at which this output buffer drains
   is controlled by the subscriber via the maximum rate mechanism.  When
   a set of notifications are batched together, the way in which
   overlapping resource state is handled depends on the type of the
   resource state:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In theory, there are many buffer policies that the notifier could
      implement.  However, we only concentrate on two practical buffer
      policies in this specification, leaving additional ones for
      further study and out of the scope of this specification.  These
      two buffer policies depend on the mode in which the notifier is
      operating.
   Full-state:  Last (most recent) full-state notification of each
      resource is sent out, and all others in the buffer are discarded.
      This policy applies to those event packages that carry full-state
      notifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Partial-state:  The state deltas of each buffered partial
      notification per resource are merged, and the resulting
      notification is sent out.  This policy applies to those event
      packages that carry partial-state notifications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   Buffer Policy Description</h3></a>

	<a name="section-5.5.1"><h4>5.5.1   Partial-State Notifications</h4></a>

   With partial notifications, the notifier needs to maintain a separate
   buffer for each subscriber since each subscriber may have a different
   value for the maximum rate of notifications.  The notifier will
   always need to keep both a copy of the current full state of the
   resource F, as well as the last successfully communicated full state
   view F' of the resource in a specific subscription.  The construction
   of a partial notification then involves creating a difference of the
   two states, and generating a notification that contains that
   difference.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the maximum rate mechanism is applied to the subscription, it is
   important that F' be replaced with F only when the difference of F
   and F' is already included in a partial-state notification to the
   subscriber allowed by the maximum rate mechanism.  Additionally, the
   notifier implementation SHOULD check to see that the size of an
   accumulated partial state notification is smaller than the full
   state, and if not, the notifier SHOULD send the full-state
   notification instead.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5.2"><h4>5.5.2   Full-State Notifications</h4></a>

   With full-state notifications, the notifier only needs to keep the
   full state of the resource, and when that changes, send the resulting
   notification to the subscriber.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When the maximum rate mechanism is applied to the subscription, the
   notifier receives the state changes of the resource and generates a
   notification.  If there is a pending notification, the notifier
   simply replaces that notification with the new notification,
   discarding the older state.
	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6   Estimated Bandwidth Savings</h3></a>

   It is difficult to estimate the total bandwidth savings accrued by
   using the maximum rate mechanism over a subscription, since such
   estimates will vary depending on the usage scenarios.  However, it is
   easy to see that given a subscription where several full-state
   notifications would have normally been sent in any given interval set
   by the "max-rate" parameter, only a single notification is sent
   during the same interval when using the maximum rate mechanism,
   yielding bandwidth savings of several times the notification size.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   With partial-state notifications, drawing estimates is further
   complicated by the fact that the states of consecutive updates may or
   may not overlap.  However, even in the worst-case scenario, where
   each partial update is to a different part of the full state, a rate
   controlled notification merging all of these n partial states
   together should at a maximum be the size of a full-state update.  In
   this case, the bandwidth savings are approximately n times the size
   of the header fields of the NOTIFY request.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is also true that there are several compression schemes available
   that have been designed to save bandwidth in SIP, e.g., SigComp
   [RFC3320] and TLS compression [RFC3943].  However, such compression
   schemes are complementary rather than competing mechanisms to the
   maximum rate mechanism.  After all, they can both be applied
   simultaneously.

   A subscriber that wishes to update the previously agreed value for
   maximum, minimum, or adaptive minimum rate of notifications MUST
   include all desired values for the "max-rate", "min-rate", and
   "adaptive-min-rate" parameters in an Event header field of the 2xx
   response to a NOTIFY request.  Any of the other header field
   parameters currently defined for the Event header field by other
   specifications do not have a meaning if the Event header field is
   included in the 2xx response to the NOTIFY request.  These header
   field parameters MUST be ignored by the notifier, if present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The event type listed in the Event header field of the 2xx response

   field in the corresponding NOTIFY request.

	<a name="section-11"><h2>11.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Naturally, the security considerations listed in RFC 3265 [RFC3265],
   which the rate control mechanisms described in this document extends,
   apply in their entirety.  In particular, authentication and message
   integrity SHOULD be applied to subscriptions with this extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] recommends the integrity protection of the Event
   header field of SUBSCRIBE requests.  Implementations of this
   extension SHOULD also provide integrity protection for the Event
   header field included in the 2xx response to the NOTIFY request.
   Without integrity protection, an eavesdropper could see and modify
   the Event header field, or it could manipulate the transmission of a
   200 (OK) response to the NOTIFY request to suppress or flood
   notifications without the subscriber seeing what caused the problem.
   When the maximum rate mechanism involves partial-state notifications,
   the security considerations listed in RFC 5263 [RFC5263] apply in
   their entirety.
