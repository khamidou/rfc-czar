	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Predictor is a high speed compression algorithm, available without
   license fees.  The compression ratio obtained using predictor is not
   as good as other compression algorithms, but it remains one of the
   fastest algorithms available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that although care has been taken to ensure that the following
   code does not infringe any patents, there is no assurance that it is
   not covered by a patent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Licensing</h2></a>

   There are no license fees or costs associated with using the
   Predictor algorithm.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Use the following code at your own risk.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Predictor Packets</h2></a>

   Before any Predictor packets may be communicated, PPP must reach the
   Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the Compression Control Protocol
   must reach the Opened state.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Exactly one Predictor datagram is encapsulated in the PPP Information
   field, where the PPP Protocol field indicates type hex 00FD
   (compressed datagram).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The maximum length of the Predictor datagram transmitted over a PPP
   link is the same as the maximum length of the Information field of a
   PPP encapsulated packet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Prior to compression, the uncompressed data begins with the PPP
   Protocol number.  This value MAY be compressed when Protocol-Field-
   Compression is negotiated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PPP Link Control Protocol packets MUST NOT be send within compressed
   data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Predictor theory</h3></a>

   Predictor works by filling a guess table with values, based on the
   hash of the previous characters seen. Since we are either emitting
   the source data, or depending on the guess table, we add a flag bit
   for every byte of input, telling the decompressor if it should
   retrieve the byte from the compressed data stream, or the guess
   table. Blocking the input into groups of 8 characters means that we
   don't have to bit-insert the compressed output - a flag byte preceeds
   every 8 bytes of compressed data. Each bit of the flag byte
   corresponds to one byte of reconstructed data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Take the source file:

   And now, on to the source - note that it has been modified to work
   with a split block. If your data stream can't be split within a block
   (e.g., compressing packets), then the code dealing with "final", and
   the memcpy are not required.  You can detect this situation (or
   errors, for that matter) by observing that the flag byte indicates
   that more data is required from the compressed data stream, but you
   are out of data (len in decompress is <= 0). It *is* ok if len == 0,
   and flags indicate guess table usage.

   The correct encapsulation for type 1 compression is the protocol
   type, 1 bit indicating if the data is compressed or not, 15 bits of
   the uncompressed data length in octets, compressed data, and
   uncompressed CRC-16 of the two octets of unsigned length in network
   byte order, followed by the original, uncompressed data packet.

   The CCP Protocol Identifier that starts the packet is always 0xfd.
   If PPP Protocol field compression has not be negotiated, it MUST be a
   16-bit field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Compressed data is the Protocol Identifier and the Info fields of

   compression has been negotiated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is not required that any of the fields land on an even word
   boundary - the compressed data may be of any length.  If during the

   means that the compress or decompress process has become
   desyncronized.  This will happen as a result of a frame being lost in
   transit if LAPB is not used.  In this case, a new configure-request

   The correct encapsulation for type 2 compression is the protocol

   uncompressed CRC-16 of the two octets of unsigned length in network

   stream may be broken at any convenient place for encapsulation
   purposes.  With type 2 encapsulation, LAPB is almost essential for
