    Extensions to OSPF for Advertising Optional Router Capabilities

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to
   know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the
   routing domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities.  The Router
   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is defined for this
   purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with an Opaque
   LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a unique
   LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be
   advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or
   autonomous system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by
   providing a revised specification that includes support for
   advertisement of multiple instances of the RI LSA and a TLV for
   functional capabilities.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFv3]
   routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other
   routers in the routing domain.  This can be useful for both the
   advertisement and discovery of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 capabilities.
   Throughout this document, OSPF will be used when the specification is
   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  Similarly, OSPFv2 or OSPFv3
   will be used when the text is protocol specific.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to advertise
   optional router capabilities.  In the case of OSPFv2, all the bits in
   this field have been allocated so additional optional capabilities
   cannot be advertised.  This document describes extensions to OSPF to
   advertise these optional capabilities via Opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 and
   LSAs with a unique type in OSPFv3.  For existing OSPF capabilities,
   backwards compatibility issues dictate that this advertisement is
   used primarily for informational purposes.  For future OSPF
   extensions, this advertisement MAY be used as the sole mechanism for
   advertisement and discovery.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by providing a revised specification
   including support for advertisement of multiple instances of the RI
   LSA and a TLV for functional capabilities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Notation</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Summary of Changes from RFC 4970</h3></a>

   This document includes the following changes from RFC 4970 [RFC4970]:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. The main change is that an OSPF router will be able to advertise
      multiple instances of the OSPF Router Information LSA.  This
      change permeates through much of the document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Additionally, Section 2.6 includes an additional TLV for
      functional capabilities.  This is in contrast to the existing TLV
      that is used to advertise capabilities for informational purposes
      only.
   3. The IANA allocation policy has been changed from "Standards
      Action" to "IETF Review" [IANA-GUIDE] for the following
      registries:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      o  OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes
      o  OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs
      o  OSPF Router Informational Capability Bits
      o  OSPF Router Functional Capability Bits

   4. Finally, references have been updated for documents that have
      become RFCs and RFCs that have been obsoleted since the
      publication of RFC 4970.

   OSPFv2 routers will advertise a link scoped, area-scoped, or AS-
   scoped Opaque LSA [OPAQUE].  The OSPFv2 RI LSA has an Opaque type of
   4 and the Opaque ID is the RI LSA Instance ID.  The first Opaque ID,
   i.e., 0, SHOULD always contain the Router Informational Capabilities
   TLV and, if advertised, the Router Functional Capabilities TLV.  RI
   LSA instances subsequent to the first can be used for information

   The OSPFv3 Router Information LSA has a function code of 12 while the
   S1/S2 bits are dependent on the desired flooding scope for the LSA.
   The U bit will be set indicating that the OSPFv3 RI LSA should be

   for this LSA is the Instance ID.  The first Instance ID, i.e., 0,
   SHOULD always contain the Router Informational Capabilities TLV and,

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an RI LSA is the same as

   The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/Value

                             Figure 3.  TLV Format

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the length
   field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the total
   size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 4-octet
   aligned.  For example, a 1-octet value would have the length field
   set to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the
   value portion of the TLV.  The padding is composed of undefined bits.
   Unrecognized types are ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a new Router Information LSA TLV is defined, the specification
   MUST explicitly state whether the TLV is applicable to OSPFv2 only,
   OSPFv3 only, or both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">             Figure 6.  OSPF Router Functional Capabilities TLV

   The Router Functional Capabilities TLV MAY be followed by optional
   TLVs that further specify a capability.  In contrast to the Router
   Informational Capabilities TLV, the OSPF extensions advertised in
   this TLV MAY be used by other OSPF routers to dictate protocol
   operation.  The specifications for functional capabilities advertised
   in this TLV MUST describe protocol behavior and address backwards
   compatibility.
	<a name="section-2.7"><h3>2.7   Flooding Scope of the Router Information LSA</h3></a>

   The flooding scope for a Router Information LSA is determined by the
   LSA type.  For OSPFv2, a type 9 (link-scoped), type 10 (area-scoped),
   or type 11 (AS-scoped) Opaque LSA may be flooded.  For OSPFv3, the S1
   and S2 bits in the LSA type determine the flooding scope.  If AS-wide
   flooding scope is chosen, the originating router should also
   advertise area-scoped LSA(s) into any attached Not-So-Stubby Area
   (NSSA) area(s).  An OSPF router MAY advertise different capabilities
   when both NSSA area-scoped LSA(s) and an AS-scoped LSA are
   advertised.  This allows functional capabilities to be limited in
   scope.  For example, a router may be an area border router but only
   support traffic engineering (TE) in a subset of its attached areas.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The choice of flooding scope is made by the advertising router and is
   a matter of local policy.  The originating router MAY advertise
   multiple RI LSAs with the same Instance ID as long as the flooding
   scopes differ.  TLV flooding-scope rules will be specified on a per-
   TLV basis and MUST be specified in the accompanying specifications
   for future Router Information LSA TLVs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Backwards Compatibility</h2></a>

   For backwards compatibility, previously advertised Router Information
   TLVs SHOULD continue to be advertised in the first instance, i.e., 0,
   of the Router Information LSA.  If a Router Information TLV is
   advertised in multiple Router Information LSA instances and the
   multiple instance processing is not explicitly specified in the RFC
   defining that Router Information TLV, the Router Instance TLV in the
   Router Information LSA with the numerically smallest Instance ID will
   be used and subsequent instances will be ignored.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document describes both a generic mechanism for advertising
   router capabilities and TLVs for advertising informational and
   functional capabilities.  The capability TLVs are less critical than
   the topology information currently advertised by the base OSPF
   protocol.  The security considerations for the generic mechanism are
   dependent on the future application and, as such, should be described
   as additional capabilities are proposed for advertisement.  Security
   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in [OSPF] and
   [OSPFv3].
