</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   The Sieve scripting language allows users to control handling and
   disposal of their incoming e-mail.  By default, an e-mail message
   that is processed by a Sieve script is saved in the owner's "inbox".
   Actions such as "fileinto" and "redirect" cancel this default
   behavior.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a new keyword parameter, ":copy", to be used
   with the Sieve "fileinto" and "redirect" actions.  Adding ":copy" to
   an action suppresses cancellation of the default "inbox" save.  It
   allows users to add commands to an existing script without changing
   the meaning of the rest of the script.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The Sieve scripting language [SIEVE] allows users to control handling
   and disposal of their incoming e-mail.  Two frequently used Sieve
   commands are "fileinto" (saving into a local message store, such as
   an IMAP server) and "redirect" (forwarding to another e-mail
   address).  Both of these cancel the Sieve default behavior of saving
   into the user's "inbox".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   But some users have the notion of forwarding an extra copy of a
   message for safekeeping to another e-mail address, or of saving a
   copy in a folder - in addition to the regular message delivery, which
   shouldn't be affected by the copy.
   If saving an extra copy is all the user wanted to do,

      fileinto "unfiltered";
      keep;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   would do the job.  The "keep" command does explicitly what the
   cancelled default behavior did.  But the explicit "keep" is a poor
   substitute for the implicit "keep" when more processing follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      fileinto "unfiltered";
      keep;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      if header "Subject" "MAKE MONEY FAST!!!"
      {
              discard;
      }

   In this example, the "discard" is ineffective against the explicit
   "keep"; the discarded message still ends up in the user's inbox.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible to generate Sieve code that perfectly expresses a
   user's wishes, but such code quickly grows unwieldy because it needs
   to keep track of the state that the implicit "keep" would have had
   without the "fileinto" or "redirect" command.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This extension tries to make life easier for user interface designers
   and script writers by allowing them to express the "copy" semantics
   directly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions used</h2></a>

   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
   use of [KEYWORDS] and "Syntax:" label for the definition of action
   and tagged arguments syntax.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The capability string associated with extension defined in this
   document is "copy".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   ":copy" extension to the "fileinto" and "redirect" commands</h2></a>

   Syntax:
        "fileinto" [":copy"] <folder: string>
        "redirect" [":copy"] <address: string>

   If the optional ":copy" keyword is specified with "fileinto" or
   "redirect", the tagged command does not cancel the implicit "keep".
   Instead, it merely files or redirects a copy in addition to whatever
   else is happening to the message.
   Example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      require ["copy", "fileinto"];
      fileinto :copy "incoming";

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      # ... more processing follows ...

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The "copy" extension makes it easier to eavesdrop on a user's message
   stream without the user noticing.  This was technically possible
   before if an attacker gained read/write access to a user's Sieve
   scripts, but now an attacker no longer needs to parse a script in
   order to modify it.  Write access to Sieve scripts must be protected
   as strongly as read/write access to e-mail, for example by using
   secure directory protocols such as correctly parameterized LDAP over
   TLS [LDAP].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Organizations that wish to monitor their users' e-mail traffic must
   familiarize themselves with local data protection laws before
   creating stores of old e-mail traffic without control, or perhaps
   even knowledge, of the sender or intended recipients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Organizations that legally use "redirect :copy" to eavesdrop on
   correspondence (for example, by keeping a log to answer questions
   about insider trading at a later time) can avoid future problems by
   setting users' privacy expectations correctly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   Sieve extension specified in this document.
