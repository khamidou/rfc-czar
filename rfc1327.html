                  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document describes a set of mappings which will enable
   interworking between systems operating the CCITT X.400 1988)
   Recommendations on Message Handling Systems / ISO IEC 10021 Message
   Oriented Text Interchange Systems (MOTIS) [CCITT/ISO88a], and systems
   using the RFC 822 mail protocol [Crocker82a] or protocols derived
   from RFC 822.  The approach aims to maximise the services offered
   across the boundary, whilst not requiring unduly complex mappings.
   The mappings should not require any changes to end systems. This
   document is a revision based on RFCs 987, 1026, 1138, and 1148
   [Kille86a,Kille87a] which it obsoletes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies a mapping between two protocols.  This
   specification should be used when this mapping is performed on the
   DARPA Internet or in the UK Academic Community.  This specification
   may be modified in the light of implementation experience, but no
   substantial changes are expected.

Chapter 1 -- Overview

	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   X.400</h3></a>

   This document relates to the CCITT 1988 X.400 Series Recommendations
   / ISO IEC 10021 on the Message Oriented Text Interchange Service
   (MOTIS).  This ISO/CCITT standard is referred to in this document as
   "X.400", which is a convenient shorthand.  Any reference to the 1984
   CCITT Recommendations will be explicit.  X.400 defines an
   Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS), making use of a store and
   forward Message Transfer System.  This document relates to the IPMS,
   and not to wider application of X.400.  It is expected that X.400
   will be implemented very widely.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2  RFC 822</h3></a>

   RFC 822 evolved as a messaging standard on the DARPA (the US Defense
   Advanced Research Projects Agency) Internet.  It specifies and end to
   end message format.  It is used in conjunction with a number of
   different message transfer protocol environments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SMTP Networks
       On the DARPA Internet and other TCP/IP networks, RFC 822 is
       used in conjunction with two other standards: RFC 821, also
       known as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [Postel82a],
       and RFC 920 which is a Specification for domains and a
       distributed name service [Postel84a].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   UUCP Networks
       UUCP is the UNIX to UNIX CoPy protocol, which is usually
       used over dialup telephone networks to provide a simple
       message transfer mechanism.  There are some extensions to
       RFC 822, particularly in the addressing.  They use domains
       which conform to RFC 920, but not the corresponding domain
       nameservers [Horton86a].
   Bitnet
       Some parts of Bitnet and related networks use RFC 822
       related protocols, with EBCDIC encoding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   JNT Mail Networks
       A number of X.25 networks, particularly those associated
       with the UK Academic Community, use the JNT (Joint Network
       Team) Mail Protocol, also known as Greybook [Kille84a].
       This is used with domains and name service specified by the
       JNT NRS (Name Registration Scheme) [Larmouth83a].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mappings specified here are appropriate for all of these
   networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   The need for conversion</h3></a>

   There is a large community using RFC 822 based protocols for mail
   services, who will wish to communicate with users of the IPMS
   provided by X.400 systems.  This will also be a requirement in cases
   where communities intend to make a transition to use of an X.400
   IPMS, as conversion will be needed to ensure a smooth service
   transition.  It is expected that there will be more than one gateway,
   and this specification will enable them to behave in a consistent
   manner.  Note that the term gateway is used to describe a component
   performing the protocol mappings between RFC 822 and X.400.  This is
   standard usage amongst mail implementors, but should be noted
   carefully by transport and network service implementors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Consistency between gateways is desirable to provide:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Consistent service to users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   The best service in cases where a message passes through
        multiple gateways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4"><h3>1.4   General approach</h3></a>

   There are a number of basic principles underlying the details of the
   specification.  These principles are goals, and are not achieved in
   all aspects of the specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   The specification should be pragmatic.  There should not be
        a requirement for complex mappings for "Academic" reasons.
        Complex mappings should not be required to support trivial
        additional functionality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   Subject to 1), functionality across a gateway should be as
        high as possible.
   3.   It is always a bad idea to lose information as a result of
        any transformation.  Hence, it is a bad idea for a gateway
        to discard information in the objects it processes.  This
        includes requested services which cannot be fully mapped.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.   All mail gateways actually operate at exactly one level
        above the layer on which they conceptually operate.  This
        implies that the gateway must not only be cognisant of the
        semantics of objects at the gateway level, but also be
        cognisant of higher level semantics.  If meaningful
        transformation of the objects that the gateway operates on
        is to occur, then the gateway needs to understand more than
        the objects themselves.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.   Subject to 1), the specification should be reversible.  That
        is, a double transformation should bring you back to where
        you started.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.5"><h3>1.5   Gatewaying Model</h3></a>

	<a name="section-1.5.1"><h4>1.5.1   X.400</h4></a>

   X.400 defines the IPMS Abstract Service in X.420/ISO 10021-7,
   [CCITT/ISO88b] which comprises of three basic services:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Origination

   2.   Reception

   3.   Management

   Management is a local interaction between the user and the IPMS, and
   is therefore not relevant to gatewaying.  The first two services
   consist of operations to originate and receive the following two
   objects:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   IPM (Interpersonal Message). This has two components: a
        heading, and a body.  The body is structured as a sequence
        of body parts, which may be basic components (e.g., IA5
        text, or G3 fax), or IP Messages.  The heading consists of
        fields containing end to end user information, such as
        subject, primary recipients (To:), and importance.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   IPN (Inter Personal Notification).  A notification  about
        receipt of a given IPM at the UA level.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Origination service also allows for origination of a probe, which
   is an object to test whether a given IPM could be correctly received.
   The Reception service also allows for receipt of Delivery Reports
   DR), which indicate delivery success or failure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These IPMS Services utilise the Message Transfer (MT) Abstract
   Service [CCITT/ISO88c].  The MT Abstract Service provides the
   following three basic services:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Submission (used by IPMS Origination)

   2.   Delivery (used by IPMS Reception)

   3.   Administration (used by IPMS Management)

   Administration is a local issue, and so does not affect this
   standard.  Submission and delivery relate primarily to the MTS
   Message (comprising Envelope and Content), which carries an IPM or
   IPN (or other uninterpreted contents).  There is also an Envelope,
   which includes an ID, an originator, and a list of recipients.
   Submission also includes the probe service, which supports the IPMS
   Probe. Delivery also includes Reports, which indicate whether a given
   MTS Message has been delivered or not.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MTS is REFINED into the MTA (Message Transfer Agent) Service,
   which defines the interaction between MTAs, along with the procedures
   for distributed operation.  This service provides for transfer of MTS
   Messages, Probes, and Reports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.5.2"><h4>1.5.2   RFC 822</h4></a>

   RFC 822 is based on the assumption that there is an underlying
   service, which is here called the 822-MTS service.  The 822-MTS
   service provides three basic functions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Identification of a list of recipients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   Identification of an error return address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.   Transfer of an RFC 822 message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible to achieve 2) within the RFC 822 header.  Some 822-MTS
   protocols, in particular SMTP, can provide additional functionality,
   but as these are neither mandatory in SMTP, nor available in other
   822-MTS protocols, they are not considered here.  Details of aspects
   specific to two 822-MTS protocols are given in Appendices B and C.
   An RFC 822 message consists of a header, and content which is
   uninterpreted ASCII text.  The header is divided into fields, which
   are the protocol elements.  Most of these fields are analogous to P2
   heading fields, although some are analogous to MTS Service Elements
   or MTA Service Elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.5.3"><h4>1.5.3   The Gateway</h4></a>

   Given this functional description of the two services, the functional
   nature of a gateway can now be considered.  It would be elegant to
   consider the 822-MTS service mapping onto the MTS Service Elements
   and RFC 822 mapping onto an IPM, but reality just does not fit.
   Another elegant approach would be to treat this document as the
   definition of an X.400 Access Unit (AU).  Again, reality does not
   fit.  It is necessary to consider that the IPM format definition, the
   IPMS Service Elements, the MTS Service Elements, and MTA Service
   Elements on one side are mapped into RFC 822 + 822-MTS on the other
   in a slightly tangled manner.  The details of the tangle will be made
   clear in Chapter 5.  Access to the MTA Service Elements is minimised.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following basic mappings are thus defined.  When going from RFC
   822 to X.400, an RFC 822 message and the associated 822-MTS
   information is always mapped into an IPM (MTA, MTS, and IPMS
   Services).  Going from X.400 to RFC 822, an RFC 822 message and the
   associated 822-MTS information may be derived from:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   A Report (MTA, and MTS Services)

   2.   An IPN (MTA, MTS, and IPMS services)

   3.   An IPM (MTA, MTS, and IPMS services)

   Probes (MTA Service) must be processed by the gateway, as discussed
   in Chapter 5.  MTS Messages containing Content Types other than those
   defined by the IPMS are not mapped by the gateway, and should be
   rejected at the gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.5.4"><h4>1.5.4   Repeated Mappings</h4></a>

   The primary goal of this specification is to support single mappings,
   so that X.400 and RFC 822 users can communicate with maximum
   functionality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mappings specified here are designed to work where a message
   traverses multiple times between X.400 and RFC 822. This is often
   essential, particularly in the case of distribution lists.  However,
   in general, this will lead to a level of service which is the lowest
   common denominator (approximately the services offered by RFC 822).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some RFC 822 networks may wish to use X.400 as an interconnection
   mechanism (typically for policy reasons), and this is fully
   supported.
   Where an X.400 messages transfers to RFC 822 and then back to X.400,
   there is no expectation of X.400 services which do not have an
   equivalent service in standard RFC 822 being preserved - although
   this may be possible in some cases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.6"><h3>1.6   X.400 (1984)</h3></a><br>

   Much of this work is based on the initial specification of RFC 987
   and in its addendum RFC 1026, which defined a mapping between
   X.400(1984) and RFC 822.  A basic decision is that the mapping<br>
   defined in this document is to the full 1988 version of X.400, and
   not to a 1984 compatible subset. New features of X.400(1988) can be<br>
   used to provide a much cleaner mapping than that defined in RFC 987.
   This is important, to give good support to communities which will
   utilise full X.400 at an early date.   To interwork with 1984
   systems, Appendix G shall be followed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a message is being transferred to an X.400(1984) system by way of<br>
   X.400(1988) MTA it will give a slightly better service to follow the<br>
   rules of Appendix G.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.7"><h3>1.7   Compatibility with previous versions</h3></a>

   The changes between this and older versions of the document are given
   in Appendices I and J.    These are RFCs 987, 1026, 1138, and 1148.
   This document is a revision of RFC 1148 [Kille90a].  As far as
   possible, changes have been made in a compatible fashion.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.8"><h3>1.8   Aspects not covered</h3></a>

   There have been a number of cases where RFC 987 was used in a manner
   which was not intended.  This section is to make clear some
   limitations of scope.  In particular, this specification does not
   specify:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -   Extensions of RFC 822 to provide access to all X.400
       services

   -    X.400 user interface definition

   -    Mapping X.400 to extended versions of RFC 822, with support
        for multimedia content.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first two of these are really coupled.  To map the X.400
   services, this specification defines a number of extensions to RFC
<a href="#section-822" class="">822. As a side effect, these give the 822 user access to SOME X</a><br>
   services.  However, the aim on the RFC 822 side is to preserve
   current service, and it is intentional that access is not given to
   all X.400 services.  Thus, it will be a poor choice for X.400
   implementors to use RFC 987(88) as an interface - there are too many<br>
   aspects of X.400 which cannot be accessed through it.  If a text
   interface is desired, a specification targeted at X.400, without RFC
   822 restrictions, would be more appropriate.  Some optional and
   limited extensions in this area have proved useful, and are defined
   in Appendix H.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.9"><h3>1.9   Subsetting</h3></a>

   This proposal specifies a mapping which is appropriate to preserve
   services in existing RFC 822 communities.  Implementations and
   specifications which subset this specification are strongly
   discouraged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.10"><h3>1.10   Document Structure</h3></a>

   This document has five chapters:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Overview - this chapter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   Service Elements - This describes the (end user) services
        mapped by a gateway.

   the context of SINGLE transfers only, and not repeated mappings
   through multiple gateways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   The Notion of Service Across a Gateway</h3></a>

   RFC 822 and X.400 provide a number of services to the end user.  This
   chapter describes the extent to which each service can be supported
   across an X.400 <-> RFC 822 gateway.  The cases considered are single
   transfers across such a gateway, although the problems of multiple
   crossings are noted where appropriate.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.1"><h4>2.1.1   Origination of Messages</h4></a>

   When a user originates a message, a number of services are available.
   Some of these imply actions (e.g., delivery to a recipient), and some
   are insertion of known data (e.g., specification of a subject field).
   This chapter describes, for each offered service, to what extent it
   is supported for a recipient accessed through a gateway.  There are
   three levels of support:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Supported
        The corresponding protocol elements map well, and so the
        service can be fully provided.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Not Supported
        The service cannot be provided, as there is a complete
        mismatch.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Partial Support
        The service can be partially fulfilled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the first two cases, the service is simply marked as Supported" or
   "Not Supported".  Some explanation may be given if there are
   additional implications, or the (non) support is not intuitive.  For
   partial support, the level of partial support is summarised.  Where
   partial support is good,  this will be described by a phrase such as
   "Supported by use of.....".  A common case of this is where the
   service is mapped onto a non- standard service on the other side of
   the gateway, and this would have lead to support if it had been a
   standard service.  In many cases, this is equivalent to support.  For
   partial support, an indication of the mechanism is given, in order to
   give a feel for the level of support provided.  Note that this is not
   a replacement for Chapter 5, where the mapping is fully specified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a service is described as supported, this implies:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Semantic correspondence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    No (significant) loss of information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Any actions required by the service element.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example of a service gaining full support: If an RFC 822
   originator specifies a Subject:  field, this is considered to be
   supported, as an X.400 recipient will get a subject indication.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In many cases, the required action will simply be to make the
   information available to the end user.  In other cases, actions may
   imply generating a delivery report.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All RFC 822 services are supported or partially supported for
   origination.  The implications of non-supported X.400 services is
   described under X.400.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1.2"><h4>2.1.2   Reception of Messages</h4></a>

   For reception, the list of service elements required to support this
   mapping is specified.  This is really an indication of what a
   recipient might expect to see in a message which has been remotely
   originated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   RFC 822</h3></a>

   RFC 822 does not explicitly define service elements, as distinct from
   protocol elements.  However, all of the RFC 822 header fields, with
   the exception of trace, can be regarded as corresponding to implicit
   RFC 822 service elements.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2.1"><h4>2.2.1   Origination in RFC 822</h4></a>

   A mechanism of mapping, used in several cases, is to map the RFC 822
   header into a heading extension in the IPM (InterPersonal Message).
   This can be regarded as partial support, as it makes the information
   available to any X.400 implementations which are interested in these
   services. Communities which require significant RFC 822 interworking
   are recommended to require that their X.400 User Agents are able to
   display these heading extensions.  Support for the various service
   elements (headers) is now listed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Date:
        Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   From:
        Supported.  For messages where there is also a sender field,
        the mapping is to "Authorising Users Indication", which has
        subtly different semantics to the general RFC 822 usage of
        From:.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Sender:
        Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Reply-To:
        Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To:  Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Message-Id:
        Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In-Reply-To:
        Supported, for a single reference.  Where multiple
        references are given, partial support is given by mapping to
        "Cross Referencing Indication".  This gives similar
        semantics.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   References:
        Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Keywords:
        Supported by use of a heading extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subject:
        Supported.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Comments:
        Supported by use of an extra body part.
   Encrypted:
        Supported by use of a heading extension.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Resent-*
        Supported by use of a heading extension.  Note that
        addresses in these fields are mapped onto text, and so are
        not accessible to the X.400 user as addresses.  In
        principle, fuller support would be possible by mapping onto
        a forwarded IP Message, but this is not suggested.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other Fields
        In particular X-* fields, and "illegal" fields in common
        usage (e.g., "Fruit-of-the-day:") are supported by use of

   When mapping services from X.400 to RFC 822 which are not supported
   by RFC 822, new RFC 822 headers are defined.  It is intended that
   these fields will be registered, and that co- operating RFC 822
   systems may use them.  Where these new fields are used, and no system
   action is implied, the service can be regarded as being partially
   supported.  Chapter 5 describes how to map X.400 services onto these
   new headers.  Other elements are provided, in part, by the gateway as
   they cannot be provided by RFC 822.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Some service elements are marked N/A (not applicable).  There are
   five cases, which are marked with different comments:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   N/A (local)
        These elements are only applicable to User Agent / Message
        Transfer Agent interaction and so they cannot apply to RFC
        822 recipients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   N/A (PDAU)
        These service elements are only applicable where the
        recipient is reached by use of a Physical Delivery Access
        Unit (PDAU), and so do not need to be mapped by the gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   N/A (reception)
        These services  are only applicable for reception.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   N/A (prior)
        If requested, this service must be performed prior to the
        gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   N/A (MS)
        These services are only applicable to Message Store (i.e., a
        local service).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally, some service elements are not supported.  In particular, the
   new security services are not mapped onto RFC 822.  Unless otherwise
   indicated, the behaviour of service elements marked as not supported
   will depend on the criticality marking supplied by the user.  If the
   element is marked as critical for transfer or delivery, a non-
   delivery notification will be generated.  Otherwise, the service
   request will be ignored.

        This service really means giving the user control as to

   A new service "RFC 822 Header Field" is defined using the extension
   facilities.  This allows for any RFC 822 header field to be
   represented.  It may be present in RFC 822 originated messages, which
   are received by an X.400 UA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Chapter 3 Basic Mappings

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Notation</h3></a>

   The X.400 protocols are encoded in a structured manner according to
   ASN.1, whereas RFC 822 is text encoded.  To define a detailed
   mapping, it is necessary to refer to detailed protocol elements in
   each format.  A notation to achieve this is described in this
   section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.1"><h4>3.1.1   RFC 822</h4></a>

   Structured text is defined according to the Extended Backus Naur Form
   (EBNF) defined in Section 2 of RFC 822 [Crocker82a].  In the EBNF
   definitions used in this specification, the syntax rules given in
   Appendix D of RFC 822 are assumed.  When these EBNF tokens are
   referred to outside an EBNF definition, they are identified by the
   string "822." appended to the beginning of the string (e.g.,
   822.addr-spec).  Additional syntax rules, to be used throughout this
   specification, are defined in this chapter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The EBNF is used in two ways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   To describe components of RFC 822 messages (or of 822-MTS
        components).  In this case, the lexical analysis defined in
        Section 3 of RFC 822 shall be used.  When these new EBNF
        tokens are referred to outside an EBNF definition, they are
        identified by the string "EBNF." appended to the beginning
        of the string (e.g., EBNF.importance).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   To describe the structure of IA5 or ASCII information not in
        an RFC 822 message.  In these cases, tokens will either be
        self delimiting, or be delimited by self delimiting tokens.
        Comments and LWSP are not used as delimiters, except for the
        following cases, where LWSP may be inserted according to RFC
        822 rules.
   -         Around the ":" in all headers

   -         EBNF.labelled-integer

   -         EBNF.object-identifier

   -         EBNF.encoded-info

   RFC 822 folding rules are applied to all headers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1.2"><h4>3.1.2   ASN.1</h4></a>

   An element is referred to with the following syntax, defined in EBNF:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        element         = service "." definition *( "." definition )
        service         = "IPMS" / "MTS" / "MTA"
        definition      = identifier / context
        identifier      = ALPHA *< ALPHA or DIGIT or "-" >
        context         = "[" 1*DIGIT "]"

   The EBNF.service keys are shorthand for the following service
   specifications:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      IPMS IPMSInformationObjects defined in Annex E of X.420 / ISO
           10021-7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      MTS  MTSAbstractService defined in Section 9 of X.411 / ISO
           10021-4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      MTA  MTAAbstractService defined in Section 13 of X.411 / ISO
           10021-4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The first EBNF.identifier identifies a type or value key in the
   context of the defined service specification.   Subsequent
   EBNF.identifiers identify a value label or type in the context of the
   first identifier (SET or SEQUENCE).  EBNF.context indicates a context
   tag, and is used where there is no label or type to uniquely identify
   a component.  The special EBNF.identifier keyword "value" is used to
   denote an element of a sequence.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example, IPMS.Heading.subject defines the subject element of the
   IPMS heading.  The same syntax is also used to refer to element
   values.  For example,

   MTS.EncodedInformationTypes.[0].g3Fax refers to a value of
   MTS.EncodedInformationTypes.[0] .
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   ASCII and IA5</h3></a>

   A gateway will interpret all IA5 as ASCII.  Thus, mapping between
   these forms is conceptual.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3"><h3>3.3   Standard Types</h3></a>

   There is a need to convert between ASCII text, and some of the types
   defined in ASN.1 [CCITT/ISO88d].  For each case, an EBNF syntax
   definition is given, for use in all of this specification, which
   leads to a mapping between ASN.1, and an EBNF construct.  All EBNF
   syntax definitions of ASN.1 types are in lower case, whereas ASN.1
   types are referred to with the first letter in upper case.  Except as
   noted, all mappings are symmetrical.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.1"><h4>3.3.1   Boolean</h4></a>

   Boolean is encoded as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           boolean = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

	<a name="section-3.3.2"><h4>3.3.2   NumericString</h4></a>

   NumericString is encoded as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           numericstring = *DIGIT

	<a name="section-3.3.3"><h4>3.3.3   PrintableString</h4></a>

   PrintableString is a restricted IA5String defined as:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           printablestring  = *( ps-char )
           ps-restricted-char      = 1DIGIT /  1ALPHA / " " / "'" / "+"
                              / "," / "-" / "." / "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"
           ps-delim         = "(" / ")"
           ps-char          = ps-delim / ps-restricted-char

   This can be used to represent real printable strings in EBNF.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.4"><h4>3.3.4   T.61String</h4></a>

   In cases where T.61 strings are only used for conveying human
   interpreted information, the aim of a mapping is  to render the
   characters appropriately in the remote character set, rather than to
   maximise reversibility.  For these cases, the mappings to IA5 defined
   in CCITT Recommendation X.408 (1988) shall be used [CCITT/ISO88a].<br>
   These will then be encoded in ASCII.
   There is also a need to represent Teletex Strings in ASCII, for some
   aspects of O/R Address.  For these, the following encoding is used:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           teletex-string   = *( ps-char / t61-encoded )
           t61-encoded      = "{" 1* t61-encoded-char "}"
           t61-encoded-char = 3DIGIT

   Common characters are mapped simply.  Other octets are mapped using a
   quoting mechanism similar to the printable string mechanism.  Each
   octet is represented as 3 decimal digits.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are a number of places where a string may have a Teletex and/or
   Printable String representation.  The following BNF is used to
   represent this.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      teletex-and-or-ps = [ printablestring ] [ "*" teletex-string ]

   The natural mapping is restricted to EBNF.ps-char, in order to make
   the full BNF easier to parse.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.5"><h4>3.3.5   UTCTime</h4></a>

   Both UTCTime and the RFC 822 822.date-time syntax contain:  Year
   (lowest two digits), Month, Day of Month, hour, minute, second
   (optional), and Timezone.  822.date-time also contains an optional
   day of the week, but this is redundant.  Therefore a symmetrical
   mapping can be made between these constructs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note:
        In practice, a gateway will need to parse various illegal
        variants on 822.date-time.  In cases where 822.date-time
        cannot be parsed, it is recommended that the derived UTCTime
        is set to the value at the time of translation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When mapping to X.400, the UTCTime format which specifies the
   timezone offset shall be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When mapping to RFC 822, the 822.date-time format shall include a
   numeric timezone offset (e.g., +0000).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When mapping time values, the timezone shall be preserved as
   specified.  The date shall not be normalised to any other timezone.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.3.6"><h4>3.3.6   Integer</h4></a>

   A basic ASN.1 Integer will be mapped onto EBNF.numericstring.  In
   many cases ASN.1 will enumerate Integer values or use ENUMERATED.  An
   EBNF encoding labelled-integer is provided. When mapping from EBNF to
   ASN.1, only the integer value is mapped, and the associated text is
   discarded.  When mapping from ASN.1 to EBNF, addition of an
   appropriate text label is strongly encouraged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        labelled-integer ::= [ key-string ] "(" numericstring ")"

        key-string      = *key-char
        key-char        = <a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-">


	<a name="section-3.3.7"><h4>3.3.7   Object Identifier</h4></a>

   Object identifiers are represented in a form similar to that given in
   ASN.1.  The order is the same as for ASN.1 (big-endian).  The numbers
   are mandatory, and used when mapping from the ASCII to ASN.1.  The
   key-strings are optional.  It is recommended that as many strings as
   possible are generated when mapping from ASN.1 to ASCII, to
   facilitate user recognition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        object-identifier  ::= oid-comp object-identifier
                        | oid-comp

        oid-comp ::= [ key-string ] "(" numericstring ")"

An example representation of an object identifier is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        joint-iso-ccitt(2) mhs (6) ipms (1) ep (11) ia5-text (0)<br>

        or

        (2) (6) (1)(11)(0)<br>

	<a name="section-3.4"><h3>3.4   Encoding ASCII in Printable String</h3></a>

   Some information in RFC 822 is represented in ASCII, and needs to be
   mapped into X.400 elements encoded as printable string.  For this
   reason, a mechanism to represent ASCII encoded as PrintableString is
   needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A structured subset of EBNF.printablestring is now defined.  This
   shall be used to encode ASCII in the PrintableString character set.
        ps-encoded       = *( ps-restricted-char / ps-encoded-char )
        ps-encoded-char  = "(a)"               ; (@)
                         / "(p)"               ; (%)
                         / "(b)"               ; (!)
                         / "(q)"               ; (")
                         / "(u)"               ; (_)
                         / "(l)"               ; "("
                         / "(r)"               ; ")"
                         / "(" 3DIGIT ")"

   The 822.3DIGIT in EBNF.ps-encoded-char must have range 0-127, and is
   interpreted in decimal as the corresponding ASCII character.  Special
   encodings are given for: at sign (@), percent (%), exclamation
   mark/bang (!), double quote ("), underscore (_), left bracket ((),
   and right bracket ()).  These characters, with the exception of round
   brackets, are not included in PrintableString, but are common in RFC
   822 addresses.  The abbreviations will ease specification of RFC 822
   addresses from an X.400 system.  These special encodings shall be
   interpreted in a case insensitive manner, but always generated in
   lower case.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A reversible mapping between PrintableString and ASCII can now be
   defined.  The reversibility means that some values of printable
   string (containing round braces) cannot be generated from ASCII.
   Therefore, this mapping must only be used in cases where the
   printable strings may only be derived from ASCII (and will therefore
   have a restricted domain).  For example, in this specification, it is
   only applied to a Domain Defined Attribute which will have been
   generated by use of this specification and a value such as "(" would
   not be possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To encode ASCII as PrintableString, the EBNF.ps-encoded syntax is
   used, with all EBNF.ps-restricted-char mapped directly.  All other
   822.CHAR are encoded as EBNF.ps-encoded-char.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To encode PrintableString as ASCII, parse PrintableString as
   EBNF.ps-encoded, and then reverse the previous mapping.  If the
   PrintableString cannot be parsed, then the mapping is being applied
   in to an inappropriate value, and an error shall be given to the
   procedure doing the mapping. In some cases, it may be preferable to
   pass the printable string through unaltered.
   Some examples are now given.  Note the arrows which indicate
   asymmetrical mappings:

Chapter 4 - Addressing

   Addressing is probably the trickiest problem of an X.400 <-> RFC 822
   gateway.  Therefore it is given a separate chapter.  This chapter, as
   a side effect, also defines a textual representation of an X.400 O/R
   Address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Initially we consider an address in the (human) mail user sense of
   "what is typed at the mailsystem to reference a mail user".  A basic
   RFC 822 address is defined by the EBNF EBNF.822-address:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           822-address     = [ route ] addr-spec

   In an 822-MTS protocol, the originator and each recipient are
   considered to be defined by such a construct.  In an RFC 822 header,
   the EBNF.822-address is encapsulated in the 822.address syntax rule,
   and there may also be associated comments.  None of this extra
   information has any semantics, other than to the end user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The basic X.400 O/R Address, used by the MTS for routing, is defined
   by MTS.ORAddress.  In IPMS, the MTS.ORAddress is encapsulated within
   IPMS.ORDescriptor.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It can be seen that RFC 822 822.address must be mapped with
   IPMS.ORDescriptor, and that RFC 822 EBNF.822-address must be mapped
   with MTS.ORAddress.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   A textual representation of MTS.ORAddress</h3></a>

   MTS.ORAddress is structured as a set of attribute value pairs.  It is
   clearly necessary to be able to encode this in ASCII for gatewaying
   purposes.  All components shall be encoded, in order to guarantee
   return of error messages, and to optimise third party replies.
	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Basic Representation</h3></a>

   An O/R Address has a number of structured and unstructured
   attributes.  For each unstructured attribute, a key and an encoding
   is specified.  For structured attributes, the X.400 attribute is
   mapped onto one or more attribute value pairs.  For domain defined
   attributes, each element of the sequence will be mapped onto a triple
   (key and two values), with each value having the same encoding.  The
   attributes are as follows, with 1984 attributes given in the first
   part of the table.  For each attribute, a reference is given,
   consisting of the relevant sections in X.402 / ISO 10021-2, and the
   extension identifier for 88 only attributes:

   Handling of Personal Name and Teletex Personal Name based purely on
   the EBNF.standard-type syntax defined above is likely to be clumsy.
   It seems desirable to utilise the "human" conventions for encoding
   these components.  A syntax is defined, which is designed to provide
   a clean encoding for the common cases of O/R Address specification
   where:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   There is no generational qualifier

   2.   Initials contain only letters

   3.   Given Name does not contain full stop ("."), and is at least
        two characters long.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.   Surname does not contain full stop in the first two
        characters.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5    If Surname is the only component, it does not contain full
        stop.
   The following EBNF is defined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           encoded-pn      = [ given "." ] *( initial "." ) surname

           given           = 2*<ps-char not including ".">

           initial         = ALPHA

           surname         = printablestring

   This is used to map from any string containing only printable string
   characters to an O/R address personal name.  To map from a string to
   O/R Address components, parse the string according to the EBNF.  The
   given name and surname are assigned directly.  All EBNF.initial
   tokens are concatenated without intervening full stops to generate
   the initials component.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For an O/R address which follows the above restrictions, a string is
   derived in the natural manner.  In this case, the mapping will be
   reversible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        GivenName       = "Marshall"
        Surname         = "Rose"

        Maps with  "Marshall.Rose"

        Initials        = "MT"
        Surname         = "Rose"

        Maps with  "M.T.Rose"

        GivenName       = "Marshall"
        Initials        = "MT"
        Surname         = "Rose"

        Maps with  "Marshall.M.T.Rose"

   Note that X.400 suggest that Initials is used to encode ALL initials.
   Therefore, the defined encoding is "natural" when either GivenName or
   Initials, but not both, are present.  The case where both are present
   can be encoded, but this appears to be contrived!

   The standard-type is any key defined in the table in Section 4.2,
   except PN, and DD.  The BNF leads to a set of attribute/value pairs.
   The value is interpreted according to the EBNF encoding defined in
   the table.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the standard-type is PN, the value is interpreted according to
   EBNF.encoded-pn, and the components of MTS.PersonalName and/or

   Ideally, the mapping specified would be entirely symmetrical and
   global, to enable addresses to be referred to transparently in the
   remote system, with the choice of gateway being left to the Message
   Transfer Service.  There are two fundamental reasons why this is not
   possible:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   The syntaxes are sufficiently different to make this
        awkward.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   In the general case, there would not be the necessary
        administrative co-operation between the X.400 and RFC 822
        worlds, which would be needed for this to work.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Therefore, an asymmetrical mapping is defined, which can be
   symmetrical where there is appropriate administrative control.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.1"><h4>4.3.1   X.400 encoded in RFC 822</h4></a>

   The std-or-address syntax is  used to encode O/R Address information
   in the 822.local-part of EBNF.822-address.  In some cases, further
   O/R Address information is associated with the 822.domain component.
   This cannot be used in the general case, due to character set
   problems, and to the variants of X.400 O/R Addresses which use
   different attribute types.  The only way to encode the full
   PrintableString character set in a domain is by use of the
   822.domain-ref syntax (i.e. 822.atom).  This is likely to cause
   problems on many systems.  The effective character set of domains is
   in practice reduced from the RFC 822 set, by restrictions imposed by
   domain conventions and policy, and by restrictions in RFC 821.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A generic 822.address consists of a 822.local-part and a sequence of
   822.domains (e.g., <@domain1,@domain2:user@domain3>).  All except the
   822.domain associated with the 822.local-part (domain3 in this case)
   are considered to specify routing within the RFC 822 world, and will
   not be interpreted by the gateway (although they may have identified
   the gateway from within the RFC 822 world).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The  822.domain associated with the 822.local-part identifies the
   gateway from within the RFC 822 world.  This final 822.domain may be
   used to determine some number of O/R Address attributes, where this
   does not conflict with the first role.  RFC 822 routing to gateways
   will usually be set up to facilitate the 822.domain being used for
   both purposes.  The following O/R Address attributes are considered
   as a hierarchy, and may be specified by the domain.  They are (in
   order of hierarchy):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        Country, ADMD, PRMD, Organisation, Organisational Unit

   There may be multiple Organisational Units.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A global mapping is defined between domain specifications, and some
   set of attributes.  This association proceeds hierarchically.  For
   example, if a domain implies ADMD, it also implies country.
   Subdomains under this are associated according to the O/R Address
   hierarchy.  For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        => "AC.UK" might be associated with
        C="GB", ADMD="GOLD 400", PRMD="UK.AC"

        then domain "R-D.Salford.AC.UK" maps with
        C="GB", ADMD="GOLD 400", PRMD="UK.AC", O="Salford", OU="R-D"

   There are three basic reasons why a domain/attribute mapping might be
   maintained, as opposed to using simply subdomains:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   As a shorthand to avoid redundant X.400 information.  In
        particular, there will often be only one ADMD per country,
        and so it does not need to be given explicitly.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   To deal with cases where attribute values do not fit the
        syntax:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           domain-syntax   = alphanum [ *alphanumhyphen alphanum ]
           alphanum        = <ALPHA or DIGIT>
           alphanumhyphen  = <ALPHA or DIGIT or HYPHEN>


        Although RFC 822 allows for a more general syntax, this
        restricted syntax is chosen as it is the one chosen by the
        various domain service administrations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.   To deal with missing elements in the hierarchy.  A domain
        may be associated with an omitted attribute in conjunction
        with several present ones.  When performing the algorithmic
        insertion of components lower in the hierarchy, the omitted
        value shall be skipped.  For example, if "HNE.EGM" is
        associated with "C=TC", "ADMD=ECQ", "PRMD=HNE", and omitted
        organisation, then "ZI.HNE.EGM" is mapped with "C=TC",
        "ADMD=ECQ", "PRMD=HNE", "OU=ZI". Attributes may have null
        values, and  this is treated separately from omitted
        attributes (whilst it would be bad practice to treat these
        two cases differently, they must be allowed for).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This set of mappings needs  be known by the gateways relaying between
   the RFC 822 world, and the O/R Address space associated with the
   mapping in question.  There needs to be a single global definition of
   this set of mappings.  A mapping implies an adminstrative equivalence
   between the two parts of the namespaces which are mapped together.
   To correctly route in all cases, it is necessary for all gateways to
   know the mapping.  To facilitate distribution of a global set of
   mappings, a format for the exchange of this information is defined in
   Appendix F.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The remaining attributes are encoded on the LHS, using the EBNF.std-
   or-address syntax.  For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        /I=J/S=Linnimouth/GQ=5/@Marketing.Widget.COM

   encodes the MTS.ORAddress consisting of:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        MTS.CountryName                       = "TC"
        MTS.AdministrationDomainName          = "BTT"
        MTS.OrganizationName                  = "Widget"
        MTS.OrganizationalUnitNames.value     = "Marketing"
        MTS.PersonalName.surname              = "Linnimouth"
        MTS.PersonalName.initials             = "J"
        MTS.PersonalName.generation-qualifier = "5"

   The first three attributes are determined by the domain Widget.COM.
   Then, the first element of OrganizationalUnitNames is determined
   systematically, and the remaining attributes are encoded on the LHS.
   In an extreme case, all of the attributes will be on the LHS.  As the
   domain cannot be null, the RHS will simply be a domain indicating the
   gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The RHS (domain) encoding is designed to deal cleanly with common
   addresses, and so the amount of information on the RHS is maximised.
   In particular, it covers the Mnemonic O/R Address using a 1984
   compatible encoding.  This is seen as the dominant form of O/R
   Address.  Use of other forms of O/R Address, and teletex encoded
   attributes will require an LHS encoding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is a further mechanism to simplify the encoding of common
   cases, where the only attributes to be encoded on the LHS is a (non-
   Teletex) Personal Name attributes which comply with the restrictions
   of 4.2.1.  To achieve this, the 822.local-part shall be encoded as
   EBNF.encoded-pn.  In the previous example, if the GenerationQualifier
   was not present in the previous example O/R Address, it would map
   with the RFC 822 address: J.Linnimouth@Marketing.Widget.COM.
   From the standpoint of the RFC 822 Message Transfer System, the
   domain specification is simply used to route the message in the
   standard manner.  The standard domain mechanisms are used to select
   appropriate gateways for the corresponding O/R Address space.  In
   most cases, this will be done by registering the higher levels, and
   assuming that the gateway can handle the lower levels.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.2"><h4>4.3.2   RFC 822 encoded in X.400</h4></a>

   In some cases, the encoding defined above may be reversed, to give a

   largely on the allocation of appropriate management domains.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The general case is mapped by use of domain defined attributes.  A
   Domain defined type "RFC-822" is defined. The associated attribute

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   In the context of RFC 822, and RFC 920

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           C               = "GB"
           ADMD            = "GOLD 400"

   Note in each case the PrintableString encoding of "@" as "(a)".  In
   the second example, the "RFC-822" domain defined attribute is
   interpreted everywhere within the (Private) Management Domain.  In
   the first example, further attributes are needed within the
   Management Domain to identify a gateway.  Thus, this scheme can be
   used with varying levels of Management Domain co-operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is a limit of 128 characters in the length of value of a domain

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.3"><h4>4.3.3   Component Ordering</h4></a>

   In most cases, ordering of O/R Address components is not significant

   as SEQUENCE in MTS.ORAddress, and so their order may be significant.
   This specification needs to take account of this:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   To allow consistent mapping into the domain hierarchy

   2.   To ensure preservation of order over multiple mappings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are three places where an order is specified:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   The text encoding (std-or-address) of MTS.ORAddress as used

        (Organisational Unit, and Domain Defined Attributes). When

        reasons:
   -         Alignment to the hierarchy of other components in RFC
             822 addresses (thus, Organisational Units will appear
             in the same order, whether encoded on the RHS or LHS).

             it will do the "right" thing and provide a better
             service to the end user.  This is a reflection on the
             excessive and inappropriate use of source routing in
             RFC 822 based systems.  Either approach, or the
             intermediate approach of stripping only domain
             references which reference the local gateway are
             conformant to this specification.

        As the RFC 822 and X.400 worlds are fully connected, there
        is no technical reason for this situation to occur.  In some

        privately into the gateway in question.  The O/R address

   RFC 822 users will often use an LHS encoded address to identify an
   X.400 recipient.  Because the syntax is fairly complex, a number of
   heuristics may be applied to facilitate this form of usage.  A
   gateway should take care not to be overly "clever" with heuristics,
   as this may cause more confusion than a more mechanical approach.
   The heuristics are as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Ignore the omission of a trailing "/" in the std-or syntax.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   If there is no ADMD component, and both country and PRMD are
        present, the value of /ADMD= / (single space) is assumed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.   Parse the unquoted local part according to the EBNF colon-
        or-address.  This may facilitate users used to this
        delimiter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        colon-or-address = 1*(attribute "=" value ";" *(LWSP-char))

   The remaining heuristic relates to ordering of address components.
   The ordering of attributes may be inverted or mixed.  For this
   reason, the following heuristics may be applied:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.   If there is an Organisation attribute to the left of any Org
        Unit attribute, assume that the hierarchy is inverted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.3.5"><h4>4.3.5   X.400 -> RFC 822</h4></a>

   There are two basic cases:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   RFC 822 addresses encoded in X.400.
   2.   "Genuine" X.400 addresses.  This may include symmetrically
        encoded RFC 822 addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a MTS Recipient O/R Address is interpreted, gatewaying will be

        A pragmatic approach would  be to assume that any O/R

             done, primarily because use of RFC 822 to connect X.400
             systems is not expected to be significant.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        In cases where the address refers to an X.400 UA, it is
        important that the generated domain will correctly route to
        a gateway.  In general, this is achieved by carefully co-
        ordinating RFC 822 routing with the definition of the global
        mappings, as there is no easy way for the gateway to make
        this check.  One rule that shall be used is that domains
        with only one component will not route to a gateway.  If the
        generated domain does not route correctly, the address is
        treated as if no match is found.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.   The mapping identified  in 3) gives a domain, and an O/R
        address prefix.  Follow the hierarchy: C, ADMD, PRMD, O, OU.
        For each successive component below the O/R address prefix,
        which conforms to the syntax EBNF.domain-syntax (as defined
        in 4.3.1), allocate the next subdomain.  At least one
        attribute of the X.400 address shall not be mapped onto
        subdomain, as 822.local-part cannot be null.  If there are
        omitted attributes in the O/R address prefix, these will
        have correctly and uniquely mapped to a domain component.
        Where there is an attribute omitted below the prefix, all
        attributes remaining in the O/R address shall be encoded on
        the LHS.  This is to ensure a reversible mapping. For
        example, if the is an addres /S=XX/O=YY/ADMD=A/C=NN/ and a
        mapping for /ADMD=A/C=NN/ is used, then /S=XX/O=YY/ is

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.   If the address is not  mnemonic form (form 1 variant 1),

        below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        For addresses of mnemonic form, if the remaining components
        are personal-name components, conforming to the restrictions
        of 4.2.1, then EBNF.encoded-pn is derived to form
        822.local-part.  In other cases the remaining components are
        simply encoded as 822.local-part using the
        EBNF.std-or-address syntax.  If necessary, the
        822.quoted-string encoding is used.  The following are
        examples of legal quoting: "a b".c@x; "a b.c"@x.  Either
        form may be generated, but the latter is preferred.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        If the derived 822.local-part can only be encoded by use of

        discouraged.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4"><h3>4.4   Repeated Mappings</h3></a>

   There are two types of repeated mapping:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   A recursive mapping, where the repeat is within one gateway

   2    A source route, where the repetition occurs across multiple
        gateways

	<a name="section-4.4.1"><h4>4.4.1   Recursive Mappings</h4></a>

   It is possible to supply an address which is recurive at a single
   gateway.  For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           C          = "XX"
           ADMD       = "YY"
           O          = "ZZ"
           "RFC-822"  = "Smith(a)ZZ.YY.XX"

   This is mapped first to an RFC 822 address, and then back to the
   X.400 address:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           C          = "XX"
           ADMD       = "YY"
           O          = "ZZ"
           Surname    = "Smith"

   In some situations this type of recursion may be frequent.  It is
   important that where this occurs, that no unnecessary protocol
   conversion occurs. This will minimise loss of service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.4.2"><h4>4.4.2   Source Routes</h4></a>

   The mappings defined are symmetrical and reversible across a single
   gateway.  The symmetry is particularly useful in cases of (mail
   exploder type) distribution list expansion.  For example, an X.400
   user sends to a list on an RFC 822 system which he belongs to.  The
   received message will have the originator and any 3rd party X.400 O/R
   Addresses in correct format (rather than doubly encoded).  In cases
   (X.400 or RFC 822) where there is common agreement on gateway
   identification, then this will apply to multiple gateways.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a message traverses multiple gateways, the mapping will always
   be reversible, in that a reply can be generated which will correctly
   reverse the path.  In many cases, the mapping will also be
   symmetrical, which will appear clean to the end user.  For example,
   if countries "AB" and "XY" have RFC 822 networks, but are
   interconnected by X.400, the following may happen:  The originator
   specifies:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Joe.Soap@Widget.PTT.XY

   This is routed to a gateway, which generates:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           C               = "XY"
           ADMD            = "PTT"
           PRMD            = "Griddle MHS Providers"
           Organisation    = "Widget Corporation"
           Surname         = "Soap"
           Given Name      = "Joe"

   This is then routed to another gateway where the mapping is reversed
   to give:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Joe.Soap@Widget.PTT.XY

   Here, use of the gateway is transparent.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Mappings will only be symmetrical where mapping tables are defined.
   In other cases, the reversibility is more important, due to the (far
   too frequent) cases where RFC 822 and X.400 services are partitioned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The syntax may be used to source route.  THIS IS STRONGLY
   DISCOURAGED.  For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         X.400 -> RFC 822  -> X.400

         C             = "UK"
         ADMD          = "Gold 400"
         PRMD          = "UK.AC"
         "RFC-822"     = "/PN=Duval/DD.Title=Manager/(a)Inria.ATLAS.FR"

   This will be sent to an arbitrary UK Academic Community gateway by
   X.400.  Then it will be sent by JNT Mail to another gateway
   determined by the domain Inria.ATLAS.FR (FR.ATLAS.Inria).  This will
   then derive the X.400 O/R Address:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           C             = "FR"
           ADMD          = "ATLAS"
           PRMD          = "Inria"
           PN.S          = "Duval"
           "Title"       = "Manager"

   Similarly:
   RFC 822 -> X.400 -> RFC 822

"/C=UK/ADMD=BT/PRMD=AC/RFC-822=jj(a)seismo.css.gov/"@monet.berkeley.edu

   This will be sent to monet.berkeley.edu by RFC 822, then to the AC
   PRMD by X.400, and then to jj@seismo.css.gov by RFC 822.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.5"><h3>4.5   Directory Names</h3></a>

   Directory Names are an optional part of O/R Name, along with O/R
   Address.  The RFC 822 addresses are mapped onto the O/R Address
   component. As there is no functional mapping for the Directory Name
   on the RFC 822 side, a textual mapping is used.  There is no
   requirement for reversibility in terms of the goals of this
   specification.  There may be some loss of functionality in terms of
   third party recipients where only a directory name is given, but this
   seems preferable to the significant extra complexity of adding a full
   mapping for Directory Names.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note:There is ongoing work on specification of a "user friendly"

   these fields. In some cases a (positive) delivery report will be
   generated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-4.6.2.1"><h4>4.6.2.1   822-MTS Mappings</h4></a>

   Use the basic ORAddress mapping, to generate the 822-MTS originator
   (return address) from MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name
   (MTS.ORName).  If MTS.ORName.directory-name is present, it is
   discarded.  (Note that it will be presented to the user, as described
   in 4.6.2.2).
   The 822-MTS recipient is conceptually generated from
   MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.this-recipient-name.  This is done by
   taking MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.this-recipient-name, and
   generating an 822-MTS recipient according to the basic ORAddress
   mapping, discarding MTS.ORName.directory-name if present.  However,
   if this model was followed exactly, there would be no possibility to
   have multiple 822-MTS recipients on a single message.  This is
   unacceptable, and so layering is violated.  The mapping needs to use
   the MTA level information, and map each value of
   MTA.PerRecipientMessageTransferFields.recipient-name, where the
   responsibility bit is set, onto an 822-MTS recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-4.6.2.2"><h4>4.6.2.2   Generation of RFC 822 Headers</h4></a>

   Not all per-recipient information can be passed at the 822-MTS level.
   For this reason, two new RFC 822 headers are created, in order to
   carry this information to the RFC 822 recipient.  These fields are
   "X400-Originator:"  and "X400-Recipients:".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The "X400-Originator:" field is set to the same value as the 822-MTS
   originator.  In addition, if
   MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name (MTS.ORName) contains
   MTS.ORName.directory-name then this Directory Name shall be
   represented in an 822.comment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Recipient names, taken from each value of
   MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.this-recipient-name and
   MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.other-recipient-names are made

   By taking the recipients at the MTS level, disclosure of recipients
   will be dealt with correctly.  However, this conflicts with a desire
   to optimise mail transfer.  There is no problem when disclosure of
   recipients is allowed. Similarly, there is no problem if there is
   only one RFC 822 recipient, as the "X400-Recipients field is only
   given one address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is a problem if there are multiple RFC 822 recipients, and

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   Generate one copy of the message for each RFC 822 recipient,
        with the "X400-Recipients field correctly set to the
        recipient of that copy.  This is functionally correct, but
        is likely to be more expensive.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   Discard the per-recipient information, and insert a field:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A third option of ignoring the disclosure flag is not allowed.  If
   any MTS.ORName.directory-name is present, it shall be represented in

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.orignally-intended-recipient-name
   is present, then there has been redirection, or there has been
   distribution list expansion.  Distribution list expansion is a per-

   represented by the "DL-Expansion-History:" field descrined in Section
   5.3.6.  Other information is represented in an 822.comment associated
   associated with MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.this-recipient-name,
   The message may be delivered to different RFC 822 recipients, and so
   several addresses in the "X400-Recipients:" field may have such
   comments.  The non-commented recipient is the RFC 822 recipient. The

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Return of Contents</h3></a>

   It is not clear how widely supported the X.400 return of contents
   service will be.  Experience with X.400(1984) suggests that support<br>
   of this service may not be universal.  As this service is expected in
   the RFC 822 world, two approaches are specified.  The choice will
   depend on the use of X.400 return of contents withing the X.400
   community being serviced by the gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In environments where return of contents is widely supported, content
   return can be requested as a service.  The content return service can
   then be passed back to the end (RFC 822) user in a straightforward
   manner.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In environments where return of contents is not widely supported, a
   gateway must make special provision to handle return of contents.
   For every message passing from RFC 822 -> X.400, content return
   request will not be requested, and report request always will be.
   When the delivery report comes back, the gateway can note that the
   message has been delivered to the recipient(s) in question.  If a
   non-delivery report is received, a meaningful report (containing some
   or all of the original message) can be sent to the 822-MTS
   originator.  If no report is received for a recipient, a (timeout)
   failure notice shall be sent to the 822-MTS originator.  The gateway
   may retransmit the X.400 message if it wishes.  When this approach is
   taken, routing must be set up so that error reports are returned
   through the same MTA.  This approach may be difficult to use in
   conjunction with some routing strategies.

   mapped as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   incomplete-copy
        Mapped to the extended RFC 822 field "Incomplete-Copy:".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   language
        Mapped to the extended RFC 822 field "Language:", filling in
        the two letter code. The language-description may filled in
        with a human readable description of the language, and it is
        recommended to do this.

   the list is indicated in the extended RFC 822 field "Discarded-X400-
   IPMS-Extensions:".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The IPMS.Body is mapped into the RFC 822 message body.  Each

        The mapping is straightforward (see Chapter 3).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IPMS.MessageBodyPart
        The X.400 -> RFC 822 mapping  is recursively applied, to
        generate an RFC 822 Message.  If present, the

        for the MTS Abstract Service Mappings.  If present, the
        IPMS.MessageBodyPart.parameters.delivery-time is mapped to
        the extended RFC 822 field "Delivery-Date:".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other
        If other body parts can be mapped to IA5, either by use of
        mappings defined in X.408 [CCITT88a], or by other reasonable
        mappings, this shall be done unless content conversion is
        prohibited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If some or all of the body parts cannot be converted there are three
   options.  All of these conform to this standard.  A different choice
   may be made for the case where no body part can be converted:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.   The first option is to reject the message, and send a non-
        delivery notification.  This must always be done if
        conversion is prohibited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.   The second option is to map a missing body part to something
        of the style:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                *********************************

                There was a foobarhere

                The widget gateway ate it

                *********************************

        This will allow some useful information to be transferred.
        As the recipient is likely to be a human (IPMS), then
        suitable action will usually be possible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.   Finally both may be done.  In this case, the supplementary
        information in the (positive) Delivery Report shall make
        clear that something was sent on to the recipient with
        substantial loss of information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Where there is more than one IPMS.BodyPart, the mapping defined by
   Rose and Stefferud in [Rose85a], is used to map the separate
   IPMS.BodyParts in the single RFC 822 message body.  If this is done,
   a "Message-Type:" field with value "Multiple part" shall be added,
   which will indicate to a receiving gateway that the message may be
   unfolded according to RFC 934.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note:There is currently work ongoing to produce an upgrade to RFC
        934, which also allows for support of body parts with non-
        ASCII content (MIME).  When this work is released as an RFC,
        this specification will be updated to refer to it instead
        for RFC 934.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For backwards compatibility with RFC 987, the following procedures
   shall also be followed.  If there are two IA5 body parts, and the
   first starts with the string "RFC-822-Headers:" as the first line,
   then the remainder of this body part shall be appended to the RFC 822

   There are some mappings at the MTA Abstract Service level which are
   done for IPM and IPN.  These can be derived from
   MTA.MessageTransferEnvelope.  The reasons for the mappings at this
   level, and the violation of layering are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Allowing for multiple recipients to share a single RFC 822
        message

   -    Making the X.400 trace information available on the RFC 822
        side

   -    Making any information on deferred delivery available

   The 822-MTS recipients are calculated from the full list of X.400
   recipients.  This is all of the members of
   MTA.MessageTransferEnvelope.per-recipient-fields being passed through
   the gateway, where the responsibility bit is set.  In some cases, a
   different RFC 822 message would be calculated for each recipient, due
   to differing service requests for each recipient.  As discussed in
   4.6.2..2, this specification allows either for multiple messages to
   be generated, or for the per- recipient information to be discarded.

   Note the EBNF.mta is encoded as 822.word.  If the character set does
   no allow encoding as 822.atom, the 822.quoted-string encoding is
   used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If MTA.PerMessageTransferFields.deferred-delivery-time is present, it
   is used to generate a Deferred-Delivery: field.  For some reason,
   X.400 does not make this information available at the MTS level on
   delivery.  X.400 profiles, and in particular the CEN/CENELEC profile
   for X.400(1984) [Systems85a], specify that this element must be<br>
   supported at the first MTA.  If it is not, the function may
   optionally be implemented by the gateway: that is, the gateway may
   hold the message until the time specified in the protocol element.
   Thus, the value of this element will usually be in the past.  For
   this reason, the extended RFC 822 field is primarily for information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Merge MTA.PerMessageTransferFields.trace-information, and
   MTA.PerMessageTransferFields.internal-trace-information to produce a
   single ordered trace list.  If Internal trace from other management
   domains has not been stripped, this may require complex interleaving.
   Where an element of internal trace and external trace are identical,
   except for the MTA in the internal trace, only the internal trace
   element shall be presented. Use this to generate a sequence of
   "X400-Received:" fields. The only difference between external trace
   and internal trace will be the extra MTA information in internal
   trace elements.
   When generating an RFC 822 message all trace fields (X400-Received
   and Received) shall be at the beginning of the header, before any
   other fields.  Trace shall be in chronological order, with the most
   recent element at the front of the message.  This ordering is
   determined from the order of the fields, not from timestamps in the
   trace, as there is no guarantee of clock synchronisation.  A simple
   example trace (external) is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   X400-Received: by /PRMD=UK.AC/ADMD=Gold 400/C=GB/ ; Relayed ;
           Tue, 20 Jun 89 19:25:11 +0100

   A more complex example (internal):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   X400-Received: by mta "UK.AC.UCL.CS"
         in  /PRMD=UK.AC/ADMD=Gold 400/C=GB/ ;

	<a name="section-5.3.8"><h4>5.3.8   Mappings from Report Delivery</h4></a>

   Delivery reports are mapped at the MTS service level.  This means
   that only reports destined for the MTS user will be mapped.  Some
   additional services are also taken from the MTA service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><a name="section-5.3.8.1"><h4>5.3.8.1   MTS Mappings</h4></a>

   A Delivery Report service will be represented as
   MTS.ReportDeliveryEnvelope, which comprises of per-report-fields
   (MTS.PerReportDeliveryFields) and per-recipient-fields.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A message is generated with the following fields:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   From:
        An administrator at the gateway system.  This is also the
        822-MTS originator.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To:  A mapping of the
        MTA.ReportTransferEnvelope.report-destination-name.  This is
        also the 822-MTS recipient.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Message-Type:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Subject:

         status        = "success" / "failure" / "success and failures"

         destination   = mailbox / "MTA" word

   The format of the body of the message is defined to ensure that all
   information is conveyed to the RFC 822 user in a consistent manner.
   The format is structured as if it was a message coming from X.400,
   with the description in one body part, and a forwarded message
   (return of content) in the second.  This structure is useful to the
   RFC 822 recipient, as it enables the original message to be
   extracted.  The first body part is structured as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.    A few lines giving keywords to indicate the original</h2></a>
     message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.    A human summary of the status of each recipient being</h2></a>
     reported on.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.    A clearly marked section which contains detailed information</h2></a>
     extracted from the report.  This is marked clearly, as it
     will not be comprehensible to the average user.  It is
     retained, as it may be critical to diagnosing an obscure
     problem.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     This section may be omitted in positive DRs, and it is
     recommended that this is appropriate for most gateways.

   The format is defined as a fixed definition of an the outer level

   envelope, provides a means of encapsulating a section of the header
   in a manner which is clear to the end user.  Each line of this
   section begins with "*".  Each element of EBNF.text within %EBNF.dr-
   administrator-info-envelope must not contain <CRLF>.  This is used to
   wrap up EBNF.dr-administrator-info, which will generate a sequenece
   of lines not starting with "*".  EBNF.drc-fields may be folded using
   the RFC 822 folding rules.

	<a name="section-5.3.9"><h4>5.3.9   Probe</h4></a>

   This is an MTS internal issue.  Any probe shall be serviced by the
   gateway, as there is no equivalent RFC 822 functionality.  The value
   of the reply is dependent on whether the gateway could service an MTS
   Message with the values specified in the probe.  The reply shall make
   use of MTS.SupplementaryInformation to indicate that the probe was
   serviced by the gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Appendix A - Mappings Specific to SMTP

   This Appendix is specific to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC
   821).  It describes specific changes in the context of this protocol.
   When servicing a probe, as described in section 5.3.9, use may be
   made of the SMTP VRFY command to increase the accuracy of information
   contained in the delivery report.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Appendix B - Mappings specific to the JNT Mail

   This Appendix is specific to the JNT Mail Protocol.  It describes
   specific changes in the context of this protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Introduction

      There are five aspects of a gateway which are JNT Mail Specific.
      These are each given a section of this appendix.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  Domain Ordering

      When interpreting and generating domains, the UK NRS domain
      ordering shall be used, both in headers, and in text generated for
      human description.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  Addressing

      A gateway which maps to JNT Mail should recognise the Domain
      Defined Attribute JNT-MAIL.  The value associated with this
      attribute should be interpreted according to the JNT Mail
      Specification.  This DDA shall never be generated by a gateway.
      For this reason, the overflow mechanism is not required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  Acknowledge-To:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This field has no direct functional equivalent in X.400.  However,
      it can be supported to an extent, and can be used to improve X.400
      support.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If an Acknowledge-To: field is present when going from JNT Mail to
      X.400, there are two different situations.  The first case is
      where there is one address in the Acknowledge-To: field, and it is
      equal to the 822-MTS return address.  In this case, the
      MTS.PerRecipientSubmissionFields.originator-request-report.report
      shall be set for each recipient, and the Acknowledge-To: field
      discarded.  Here, X.400 can provide the equivalent service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In all other cases two actions are taken.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         1. Acknowledgement(s) may be generated by the gateway.  The
            text of these acknowledgements shall indicate that they are
            generated by the gateway, and do not correspond to delivery.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">         2. The Acknowledge-To: field shall be passed as an extension
            heading.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When going from X.400 to JNT Mail, in cases where
      MTA.PerRecipientMessageTransferFields.per-recipient-indicators.
      originator-report bit is set for all recipients (i.e., there is a
      user request for a positive delivery report for every recipeint),
      generate an Acknowledge-To: field containing the
      MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name.  Receipt
      notification requests are not mapped onto Acknowledge-To:, as no
      association can be guaranteed between IPMS and MTS level
      addressing information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  Trace

      JNT Mail trace uses the Via: syntax.  When going from JNT Mail to
      X.400, a mapping similar to that for Received:  is used. No
      MTS.GlobalDomainIdentifier of the site making the trace can be
      derived from the Via:, so a value for the gateway is used.  The
      trace text, including the "Via:", is unfolded, truncated to
      MTS.ub-mta-name-length (32), and mapped to<br>
      MTA.InternalTraceInformationElement.mta-name.  There is no JNT
      Mail specific mapping for the reverse direction.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   6.  Timezone specification

      The extended syntax of zone defined in the JNT Mail Protocol shall
      be used in the mapping of UTCTime defined in Chapter 3.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   7.  Lack of 822-MTS originator specification

      In JNT Mail the default mapping of the
      MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name is to the Sender:
      field.  This can cause a problem when going from X.400 to JNT Mail
      if the mapping of IPMS.Heading has already generated a Sender:
      field.  To overcome this, new extended JNT Mail field is defined.
      This is chosen to align with the JNT recommendation for
      interworking with full RFC 822 systems [Kille84b].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              original-sender     = "Original-Sender" ":" mailbox

      If an IPM has no IPMS.Heading.authorizing-users component and
      IPMS.Heading.originator.formal-name is different from
      MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name, map
      MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name, onto the Sender:
      field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If an IPM has a IPMS.Heading.authorizing-users component, and
      IPMS.Heading.originator.formal-name is different from
      MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name,
      MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name is mapped onto the
      Sender: field, and IPMS.Heading.originator mapped onto the
      Original-Sender: field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      In other cases the MTS.OtherMessageDeliveryFields.originator-name,
      is already correctly represented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Appendix C - Mappings specific to UUCP Mail

   Gatewaying of UUCP and X.400 is handled by first gatewaying the UUCP
   address into RFC 822 syntax (using RFC 976) and then gatewaying the
   resulting RFC 822 address into X.400.  For example, an X.400 address

           Country         US
           Organisation    Xerox
           Personal Name   John Smith

   might be expressed from UUCP as

           inthop!gate!gatehost.COM!/C=US/O=Xerox/PN=John.Smith/

   (assuming gate is a UUCP-ARPA gateway and gatehost.COM is an ARPA-
   X.400 gateway) or

           inthop!gate!Xerox.COM!John.Smith

   (assuming that Xerox.COM and /C=US/O=Xerox/ are equivalent.)

   In the other direction, a UUCP address Smith@ATT.COM, integrated into
   822, would be handled as any other 822 address.  A non-integrated
   address such as inthop!dest!user might be handled through a pair of
   gateways:
           Country         US
           ADMD            ATT
           PRMD            ARPA
           Organisation    GateOrg
           RFC-822         inthop!dest!user@gatehost.COM

   or through a single X.400 to UUCP gateway:

           ADMD            ATT

           Organisation    GateOrg
           RFC-822         inthop!dest!user

Appendix D - Object Identifier Assignment

   An object identifier is needed for the extension IPMS element.  The
   following value shall be used.

Appendix F - Format of address mapping tables

   1.  Global Mapping Information

      The consistent operation of gateways which follow this
      specification relies of the existence of three globally defined
      mappings:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1.   Domain Name Space -> O/R Address Space

      2.   O/R Address Space -> Domain Name Space

      3.   Domain Name Space -> O/R Address of preferred gateway
      All gateways conforming to this specification shall have access to
      these mappings.  The gateway may use standardised or private
      mechanisms to access this mapping information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      One means of distributing this information is in three files.
      This appendix defines a format for these files.  Other
      standardised mechanisms to distribute the mapping information are
      expected.  In particular, mechanisms for using the Domain Name
      Scheme, and X.500 are planned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The definition of  global mapping information is being co-
      ordinated by the COSINE-MHS project, on behalf of the Internet and
      other X.400 and RFC 822 users.  For information on accessing this
      information contact:

           or
           project-team@cosine-mhs.switch.ch

   2.  Syntax Definitions

      An address syntax is defined, which is compatible with the syntax
      used for 822.domains.  By representing the O/R addresses as
      domains, all lookups can be mechanically implemented as domain ->
      domain mappings.  This syntax defined is initially for use in
      table format, but the syntax is defined in a manner which makes it
      suitable to be adapted for  use with the  Domain Name Service.
      This syntax allows for a general representation of O/R addresses,
      so that it can be used in other applications.  Not all attributes
      are used in the table formats defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To allow the mapping of null attributes  to be represented, the
      pseudo-value "@" (not a printable string character) is used to
      indicate omission of a level in the hierarchy.  This is distinct
      from the form including the element with no value, although a
      correct X.400 implementation will interpret both in the same
      manner.
      This syntax is not intended to be handled by users.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              dmn-or-address  = dmn-part *( "." dmn-part )
              dmn-part        = attribute "$" value
              attribute       = standard-type
                              / "~" dmn-printablestring
              value           = dmn-printablestring
                              / "@"
              dmn-printablestring =
                              = *( dmn-char / dmn-pair )
              dmn-char        = <"{", "}", "*", and any ps-char
                                                      except ".">
              dmn-pair        = "\."

      An example usage:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              ~ROLE$Big\.Chief.ADMD$ATT.C$US
              PRMD$DEC.ADMD$@.C$US

      The first example illustrates quoting of a ".", and the second
      omission of the ADMD level. There must be a strict ordering of all
      components in this table, with the most significant components on
      the RHS.   This allows the encoding to be treated as a domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Various further restrictions are placed on the usage of dmn-or-
      address in the address space mapping tables.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      1.   Only C, ADMD, PRMD, O, and up to four OUs may be used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      2.   No components shall be omitted from this hierarchy, although
           the hierarchy may terminate at any level.  If the mapping is
           to an omitted component, the "@" syntax is used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3.  Table Lookups

      When determining a match, there are aspects which apply to all
      lookups.  Matches are always case independent. The key for all
      three  tables is a domain. The longest possible match shall be
      obtained.  Suppose the table has two entries with the following
      keys:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              K.L
              J.K.L

      Domain "A.B.C" will not return any matches.  Domain "I.J.K.L" will
      match the entry "J.K.L:.
   4.  Domain -> O/R Address format

      The BNF is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              domain-syntax "#" dmn-or-address "#"

      Note that the trailing "#" is used for clarity, as the dmn-or-
      address syntax might lead to values with trailing blanks.  Lines
      staring with "#" are comments.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              For example:
              AC.UK#PRMD$UK\.AC.ADMD$GOLD 400.C$GB#
              XEROX.COM#O$Xerox.ADMD$ATT.C$US#
              GMD.DE#O$@.PRMD$GMD.ADMD$DBP.C$DE#

      A domain is looked up to determine the top levels of an O/R
      Address.  Components of the domain which are not matched are used
      to build the remainder of the O/R address, as described in Section
      4.3.4.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   5.  O/R Address -> Domain format

      The syntax of this table is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              dmn-or-address "#" domain-syntax "#"


              For example:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">              #
              # Mapping table
              #
              PRMD$UK\.AC.ADMD$GOLD 400.C$GB#AC.UK#

      The O/R Address is used to generate a domain key.  It is important
      to order the components correctly, and to fill in missing
      components in the hierarchy.  Use of this mapping is described in
      Section 4.3.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   6.  Domain -> O/R Address of Gateway table

      This uses the same format as the domain -> O/R address mapping.
      In this case, the two restrictions (omitted components and
      restrictions on components) do not apply.  Use of this mapping is
      described in Section 4.3.4.
Appendix G - Mapping with X.400(1984)

   This appendix defines modification to the  mapping for use with
   X.400(1984).<br>

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The X.400(1984) protocols are a proper subset of X.400(1988).  When<br>
   mapping from X.400(1984) to RFC 822, no changes to this specification<br>
   are needed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When mapping from RFC 822 to X.400(1984), no use can be made of 1988<br>
   specific features.   No use of such features is made at the MTS
   level.  One feature is used at the IPMS level, and this must be
   replaced by the RFC 987 approach.  All header information which would
   usually be mapped into the rfc-822-heading-list extension, together
   with any Comments: field in the RFC 822 header is mapped into a
   single IA5 body part, which is the first body part in the message.
   This body part will start with the string "RFC-822-Headers:" as the
   first line.  The headers then follow this line.  This specification
   requires correct reverse mapping of this format, either from 1988 or
   1984.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In an environment where RFC 822 is of major importance, it may be
   desirable for downgrading to consider the case where the message was
   originated in an RFC 822 system, and mapped according to this
   specification.  The rfc-822-heading-list extension may be mapped
   according to this appendix.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When parsing std-or, the following restrictions must be observed:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Only the 84/88 attributes identified in the table in
        Section 4.2 are present.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    No teletex encoding is allowed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If an address violates this, it should be treated as an RFC 822
   address, which will usually lead to encoding as a DDA "RFC-822".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is possible that null attributes may be present in an O/R Address.
   This is not legal in 1988, except for ADMD where the case is
   explicitly described in Section 4.3.5.  Null attributes are
   deprecated (the attribute should be omitted), and should therefore be
   unusual.  However, some systems generate them and rely on them.
   Therefore, any null attribute shall be enoded using the std-or
   encoding (e.g., /O=/).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a non-Teletex Common Name (CN) is present, it should be mapped
   onto a Domain Defined Attribute "Common".  This is in line with RFC
   1328 on X.400 1988 to 1984 downgrading [Hardcastle-K92].
Appendix H - RFC 822 Extensions for X.400 access

   This appendix defines a number of optional mappings which may be
   provided to give access from RFC 822 to a number of X.400 services.
   These mappings are beyond the basic scope of this specification.
   There has been a definite demand to use extended RFC 822 as a
   mechanism to acccess X.400, and these extensions provide access to
   certain features.  If this functionality is provided, this appendix
   shall be followed.  The following headings are defined:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">        extended-heading =
            "Prevent-NonDelivery-Report" ":"
            / "Generate-Delivery-Report" ":"
            / "Alternate-Recipient" ":" prohibition
            / "Disclose-Recipients" ":"  prohibition
            / "Content-Return" ":" prohibition

   Prevent-NonDelivery-Report and Generate-Delivery-Report allow setting
   of MTS.PerRecipientSubmissionFields.originator-report-request.  The
   setting will be the same for all recipients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Alternate-Recipient, Disclose-Recipients, and Content-Return allow
   for override of the default settings for MTS.PerMessageIndicators.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">Appendix I - Conformance

   This appendix defines a number of options, which a conforming gateway
   should specify.  Conformance to this specification shall not be
   claimed if any of the mandatory features are not implemented.  In
   particular:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Formats for all fields shall be followed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Formats for subject lines, delivery reports and IPNs shall
        be followed.   A system which followed the syntax, but
        translated text into a language other than english would be
        conformant.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    RFC 1137 shall not be followed when mapping to SMTP or to
        JNT Mail

   -    All mappings of trace shall be implemented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    There must be a mechanism to access all three global
        mappings.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A gateway should specify:
   -    Which 822-MTS protocols are supported.  The relevant
        appendices must be followed to claim support of a given
        protocol: SMTP (A); JNT Mail (B); UUCP (C).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Which X.400 versions  are supported (84 and/or 88).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    The means by which it can access the global mappings.
        Currently, the tables of the formats define in  Appendix F
        is the only means available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    The approach taken when upper bounds are exceeded at the IPM
        level  (5.1.3)

   -    The approach taken to return of contents (5.2)

   -    The approach taken to body parts which cannot be converted
        (5.3.4)

   -    The approach taken to multiple copies vs non-disclosure
        (4.6.2.2)

   The following are optional parts of this specification.  A conforming
   implementation should specify which of these it supports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Generation of extended RFC 822 fields is mandatory.
        Optionally, they may be parsed and mapped back to X.400.  A
        gateway should should indicate if this is done.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -    Support for the extension mappings of Appendix H.

        compatible manner (4.7.3.6)

Appendix J - Change History: RFC 987, 1026, 1138, 1148

   RFC 987 was the original document, and contained the key elements of
   this specification.  It was specific to X.400(1984).  RFC 1026<br>
   specified a small number of necessary changes to RFC 987.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 1138 was based on the RFC 987 work.  It contained an editorial
   error, and was reissued a few months later as RFC 1148.  RFC 1148
   will be referred to here, as it is the document which is widely
   referred to elsewhere. The major goal of RFC 1148 was to upgrade RFC
   987 to X.400(1988).  It did this, but did not obsolete RFC 987, which<br>
   was recommended for use with X.400(1984).  This appendix summarises<br>
   the changes made in going from RFC 987 to RFC 1148.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   RFC 1148 noted the following about its upgrade from RFC 987:
   Unnecessary change is usually a bad idea.  Changes on the RFC 822
   side are avoided as far as possible,  so that RFC 822 users do not
   see arbitrary differences between systems conforming to this
   specification, and those following RFC 987.  Changes on the X.400
   side are minimised, but are more  acceptable, due to the mapping onto
   a new set of services and protocols.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  Introduction

      The model has shifted from a protocol based mapping to a service
      based mapping.  This has increased the generality of the
      specification, and improved the model.  This change affects the
      entire document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A restriction on scope has been added.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.  Service Elements

      -    The new service elements of X.400 are dealt with.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -    A clear distinction is made between origination and
           reception

   3.  Basic Mappings

      -    Add teletex support

      -    Add object identifier support

      -    Add labelled integer support

      -    Make PrintableString <-> ASCII mapping reversible

      -    The printable string mapping is aligned to the NBS mapping
           derived from RFC 987.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  Addressing

      -    Support for new addressing attributes

      -    The message ID mapping is changed to not be table driven
   5.  Detailed Mappings

      -    Define extended IPM Header, and use instead of second body
           part for RFC 822 extensions

      -    Realignment of element names

      -    New syntax for reports, simplifying the header and
           introducing a mandatory body format (the RFC 987 header
           format was unusable)

      -    Drop complex autoforwarded mapping

      -    Add full mapping for IP Notifications, defining a body
           format

      -    Adopt an MTS Identifier syntax in line with the O/R Address
           syntax

      -    A new format for X400 Trace representation on the RFC 822
           side

   6.  Appendices

      -    Move Appendix on restricted 822 mappings to a separate RFC

      -    Delete Phonenet and SMTP Appendixes

Appendix K - Change History: RFC 1148 to this Document

   1.  General

      -    The scope of the document was changed to cover X.400(1984),<br>
           and so obsolete RFC 987.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -    Changes were made to allow usage to connect RFC 822 networks
           using X.400

      -    Text was tightened to be clear about optional and mandatory
           aspects

      -    A good deal of clarification

      -    A number of minor EBNF errors

      -    Better examples are given

      -    Further X.400 upper bounds are handled correctly
   2.  Basic Mappings

      -    The encoding of object identifier is changed slightly

   3.  Addressing

      -    A global mapping of domain to preferred gateway is
           introduced.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -    An overflow mechanism is defined for RFC 822 addresses of
           greater than 128 bytes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -    Changes were made to improve compatability with the PDAM on
           writing O/R Addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      +         The PD and Terminal Type keywords were aligned to the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4.  Detailed Mappings

      -    The format of the Subject: lines is defined.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      -    Illegal use (repetition) of the heading EXTENSION is
           corrected, and a new object identifier assigned.
