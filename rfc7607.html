                    Codification of AS 0 Processing

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes the use of Autonomous
   System (AS) 0 in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) OPEN, AS_PATH,
   AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR, and AS4_AGGREGATOR attributes in the BGP UPDATE
   message.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Autonomous System 0 was listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
   Registry as "Reserved - May be use [sic] to identify non-routed
   networks" ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   [RFC6491] specifies that AS 0 in a Route Origin Attestation (ROA) is
   used to mark a prefix and all its more specific prefixes as not to be
   used in a routing context.  This allows a resource holder to signal
   that a prefix (and the more specifics) should not be routed by
   publishing a ROA listing AS 0 as the only origin.  To respond to this
   signal requires that BGP implementations not accept or propagate
   routes containing AS 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
   specification.  This document corrects this omission, most
   importantly in the case of the AS_PATH.  This represents an update to
   the error handling procedures given in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of
   [RFC4271] by specifying the behavior in the presence of AS 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   At least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0, and this
   document codifies this behavior.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Requirements Notation</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Behavior</h2></a>

   A BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or propagate a route with an AS
   number of zero in the AS_PATH, AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR, or
   AS4_AGGREGATOR attributes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS_PATH
   or AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be
   handled by the procedures specified in [RFC7606].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS4_PATH
   or AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be
   handled by the procedures specified in [RFC6793].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN message, it
   MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error Code
   "OPEN Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see Section 6 of
   [RFC4271]).  A router MUST NOT initiate a connection claiming to be
   AS 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Authors of future protocol extensions that carry the Autonomous
   System number are encouraged to keep in mind that AS 0 is reserved
   and to provide clear direction on how to handle AS 0.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   The IANA has updated the registry for "16-bit Autonomous System
   Numbers" so that the entry for AS 0 is simply "Reserved".

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   By allowing a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) resource
   holder to issue a ROA saying that AS 0 is the only valid origin for a
   route, we allow them to state that a particular address resource is
   not in use.  By ensuring that all implementations that see AS 0 in a
   route ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party from announcing
   routes containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an
   AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH) containing AS 0, this document makes the
   behavior better defined.
