               ISO Transport Service on top of TCP (ITOT)

Status of the Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"><h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document is a revision to STD35, RFC1006 written by Marshall T.
   Rose and Dwight E. Cass. Since the release of RFC1006 in May 1987,
   much experience has been gained in using ISO transport services on
   top of TCP. This document refines the protocol and will eventually
   supersede RFC1006.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document describes the mechanism to allow ISO Transport Services
   to run over TCP over IPv4 or IPv6. It also defines a number of new
   features, which are not provided in RFC1006.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The goal of this version is to minimise the number of changes to
   RFC1006 and ISO 8073 transport protocol definitions, while maximising
   performance, extending its applicability and protecting the installed
   base of RFC1006 users.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction, Motivation</h2></a>

   There are two basic approaches which can be taken when "porting" ISO
   applications to TCP/IP ([RFC793],[RFC791]) and IPv6 [IPV6]
   environments. One approach is to port each individual application
   separately, developing local protocols on top of TCP. A second
   approach is based on the notion of layering the ISO Transport Service
   over TCP/IP. This approach solves the problem for all applications
   which use the ISO Transport Service. This document describes the
   second approach.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The protocol described in this memo is based on the observation that
   both the Internet Protocol Suite and the ISO Protocol Suite are
   layered systems.  A key aspect of the layering principle is that of
   layer-independence.  The concept of layer-independence means that if
   one preserves the services offered by a particular layer (the
   Service-Provider) then the Service-User at that layer is completely
   unaffected by changes in the underlying layers or by the protocol
   used within the layer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a Transport Service which appears to be
   identical to the Services and Interfaces offered by the ISO Transport
   Service Definition [ISO8072], but which will in fact implement the
   ISO Transport Protocol [ISO8073] on top of TCP/IP (IPv4 or IPv6),
   rather than the ISO Network Service [ISO8348].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The basis of this document is STD35, RFC1006 [RFC1006] written by
   Marshall T. Rose and Dwight E. Cass and it defines two transport
   classes of service.  Transport Class 0 refines and supersedes the
   RFC1006 protocol and is aimed at preserving the RFC1006 installed
   base.  Transport Class 2 defines a number of new features which are
   not provided in RFC1006, such as independence of Normal and Expedited
   Data channels and Explicit Transport Disconnection. These new
   features are largely based on RFC1859 [RFC1859] and extend the
   applicability of RFC1006 to new groups of applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies changes to the standards mentioned above and
   must be read in the context of the above mentioned standards. It will
   not be meaningful on its own.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The 'well known' TCP port 102 is reserved for hosts which implement
   the Protocol described in this document. Note that the Protocol does
   not mandate the use of TCP port 102 for all connections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  The Model</h2></a>

   This section describes the differences between the model used by the
   ISO Transport and that described in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1  ISO Transport Model</h3></a>

   The ISO 8072 standard describes the ISO Transport Service Definition
   (TS).  The ISO Transport Service Definition describes the services
   offered by the Transport Service Provider and the interfaces used to
   access these services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ISO 8073 standard describes the ISO Transport Protocol
   Specification (TP).  The ISO Transport Protocol specifies common
   encoding rules and a number of classes of transport protocol
   procedure which can be used with different network Quality of
   Service.
   The ISO 8348 standard describes the ISO Network Service Definition
   (NS).  The ISO Network Service Definition describes the services
   offered by the network service Provider and the interfaces used to
   access these services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ISO Network Service specifies two type of service:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   - Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS)

   - ConnectionLess Network Service (CLNS)

   The ISO Transport Protocol specifies five classes of procedures when
   operating over CONS and one class of procedure when operating over
   CLNS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The relationship of these ISO standards is illustrated below:

   In order to perform a N-CONNECT.REQUEST action, the TS-Provider
   performs a TCP-OPEN_PORT to the desired IPv4 or IPv6 address using
   the selected TCP port. When the TCP signals either success or
   failure, this results in an N-CONNECT.INDICATION action.
   In order to await a N-CONNECT.INDICATION event, a server performs a

   connects to this port, the TCP-CONNECTED event occurs and an implicit
   N-CONNECT.RESPONSE action is performed.

   Implementors should be aware that ISO transport protocols assume that
   they will be told by the network service provider (in this case
   TCP/IP) when the network connection being used to transmit their
   TPDUs is unexpectedly terminated.  It is therefore strongly suggested
   that the TCP keep alive mechanism be selected, as this ensures
   reporting of network connection loss.

   allows TPKT data to be sent without delay.
	<a name="section-6.3"><h3>6.3  Class negotiation</h3></a>

   The principle used in Class negotiation is identical to those

   and use of "Non-blocking Expedited Data" service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   However please note that when using "Non-blocking Expedited Data"
   service it is a wasted effort to use "Expedited Data
   Acknowledgement", since ED TPDUs are duplicated and sent on both the
   Normal Data and Expedited Data TCP connections.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.8"><h3>6.8  Class 2 Normal Data and Expedited Data handling</h3></a>

   There exist two separate application requirements for using Expedited
   Data:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1- Synchronisation of the order of delivery between Normal
      and Expedited Data TPDU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2- Independence of Normal and Expedited data channels. A busy
      Normal Data channel should not block an Expedited Data channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The protocol described in this document can accommodate both
   requirements, separately or in combination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Synchronisation:
      If synchronised order of delivery between Normal and Expedited
      Data TPDU is required then use of either "Expedited Data
      Acknowledgement" TPDU or use of the "Non-blocking Expedited Data"
      service must be negotiated during connection establishment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If synchronised order of delivery between Normal and Expedited
      Data TPDU is not required then non-use of "Expedited Data
      Acknowledgement" need not be negotiated during connection
      establishment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Independence:
      If Independence of Normal and Expedited data channels is required
      then Forward or Reverse connection must be negotiated during
      connection establishment. Expedited data TPDU must be sent on the
      Expedited data channel.
      If Independence of Normal and Expedited data channels is not
      required then Forward connection should be negotiated during
      connection establishment and the Expedited data channels should
      never be established. Expedited data TPDU is then sent inband on
      the Normal data channel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finally please note that independence of Normal and Expedited data
   channels without synchronisation relaxes the Transport Service
   definition of Expedited data and is not consistent with ISO 8072.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.9"><h3>6.9  Class 2 Forward Connection procedure</h3></a>

   As defined in ISO 8073, when "Forward Connection" (Splitting and
   Recombining) procedure is used for Expedited Data transmission, ED
   TPDU must only be sent over an outgoing NS-provider TCP connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As defined in ISO 8073, this document does not mandates use of the
   Splitting procedure for Expedited Data transmission. The
   Recombination procedure, which associates Data (normal and expedited)
   TPDUs arriving for a transport connection over two TCP connections
   must be handled.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is legal to send Expedited Data TPDU inband on the Normal Data TCP
   connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Please note that the protocol specified in this document does not
   define when an Expedited Data TCP connection should be established.
   This is an implementation choice.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When using "Non-blocking Expedited Data" service it is recommended to
   not delay establishing Expedited Data TCP connection.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.10"><h3>6.10  TPKT</h3></a>

   This document specifies the value of the TPKT reserved field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Implementation should not interpret and act upon any value in a
   reserved field. To avoid Interoperability issues with RFC1006, this
   field should be ignored on input.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.  Rationale - Interoperability with RFC1006</h2></a>

   We have chosen to maintain the same TPKT protocol version in ITOT as
   in RFC1006 (version 3). The reason for this decision is that the
   changes in this document do not conflict with RFC1006. If we were to
   change the protocol version we would prevent existing RFC1006
   implementations which mandate version 3 from interoperating with the
   protocol defined in this document.
   One consequence of this decision relates to class negotiation.  The
   protocol described in this document introduces Class 2 over TCP, and
   it therefore introduces the need to be able to perform class
   negotiation between Class 2 and Class 0.  While all Transport
   implementations should be able to handle Class negotiation, we
   recognise that some RFC1006 implementations cannot. Therefore
   Implementors should be aware that Class 2 Connect Request (with no
   Alternative class) could be accepted with a Class 0 Connect Confirm,
   at which point the Connect Confirm should be rejected as specified in
   ISO 8073.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.  Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Security issues are not specifically addressed in this document.
   Operation of this protocol is no more and no less secure than
   operation of TCP and ISO 8073 protocols. The reader is directed there
   for further reading.
