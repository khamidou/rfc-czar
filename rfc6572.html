                  RADIUS Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile IPv6
   operations using the RADIUS infrastructure.  The protocol defined in
   this document uses RADIUS-based interfaces of the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor with the AAA server for
   authentication, authorization, and policy functions.  The RADIUS
   interactions between the mobile access gateway and the RADIUS-based
   AAA server take place when the mobile node (MN) attaches,
   authenticates, and authorizes to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
   Furthermore, this document defines the RADIUS-based interface between
   the local mobility anchor and the AAA RADIUS server for authorizing
   received Proxy Binding Update messages for the mobile node's mobility
   session.  In addition to the interactions related to mobility session
   setup, this document defines the baseline for the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor generated accounting.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility
   management protocol that allows IP mobility support for a mobile node
   without requiring the mobile node's participation in any mobility-
   related signaling.  The mobile management elements in the network,
   the mobile access gateway (MAG) and the local mobility anchor (LMA),
   are the two key functions in this network-based mobility system.  The
   mobile access gateway is responsible for detecting the mobile node's
   movements in the network and for initiating the needed mobility
   management signaling with the local mobility anchor (LMA).  Both the
   mobility management agents make use of the AAA infrastructure to
   retrieve the mobile node's policy profile and for performing service
   authorization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document defines a RADIUS-based [RFC2865] profile and
   corresponding attributes to be used on the AAA interface between the
   MAG and the AAA RADIUS server.  This interface is used to carry the
   per-MN policy profile from the remote policy store to the MAG.
   Furthermore, this document also defines a RADIUS-based interface
   between the LMA and the AAA RADIUS server for authorization of the
   received Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  The AAA procedures
   defined in this document cover the following two scenarios:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  a mobile node connects to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain from the
      home network

   o  a mobile node connects to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain from a
      visited network

	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   All the mobility-related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Network Access Server (NAS):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A function that provides authorization services for a device/user
      access to the network as defined in [RFC2865].  This document
      makes an assumption that the NAS function is co-located with the
      MAG.  In scenarios where the NAS function and MAG are decoupled,
      the messaging interface needed between them for the operation of
      PMIP6 is beyond the scope of this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Home AAA (HAAA):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server
      located in the MN's home network.  This sever has access to the
      mobile node's policy profiles.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Visited AAA (VAAA):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server
      located in the MN's visited network.  The VAAA server takes the
      role of a proxy-server, forwarding the received AAA service
      request to the HAAA server in the mobile node's home network and
      relaying the response to the requesting node, after applying any
      local access network policies.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Local AAA (LAAA):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting proxy located in
      the local network.  In a roaming case, the local AAAA has the
      visited AAA role.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Solution Overview</h2></a>

   This document defines the RADIUS-based AAA interactions with the two
   mobility management elements in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Interactions between a MAG and a RADIUS-based AAA server

   o  Interactions between a LMA and a RADIUS-based AAA server

   The mobile node's policy profile [RFC5213] is present in a policy
   store and is needed by the PMIPv6 mobility management elements for
   authorizing the mobile node for mobility management service and for
   obtaining various service-related parameters.  This policy store
   could be locally co-located with the mobility management agents
   enabling direct local access or could be available from a AAA server
   through a RADIUS-based AAA interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When a mobile node attaches to an access network, the NAS on that
   access network may activate the network access authentication
   procedure.  The choice of the authentication mechanism is specific to
   the access network deployment; however, it is typically based on the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748].  The NAS performs
   the network access authentication and queries the HAAA using AAA
   protocol, such as RADIUS.  If the network access authentication
   succeeds, the MN's policy profile is obtained as part of the RADIUS
   message exchange with the AAA server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The mobile node may be an IPv4-only node, IPv6-only node, or a dual-
   stack (IPv4/v6) node.  Based on the policy specified in the policy
   profile, the network access authentication procedure SHOULD provide
   the unambiguous indication of the type of address(es) to be assigned
   for the MN in the network and with all other service-related and
   policy parameters relevant to the mobility service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After the successful network access authentication and obtaining the
   mobile node's policy profile, the MAG sends a Proxy Binding Update
   (PBU) to the LMA.  Upon receiving the PBU, the LMA interacts with the
   HAAA to obtain the mobile node's policy profile, which is required
   for authorizing and activating mobility service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document adds support for three distinct PMIPv6 mobility use
   cases, taking into account the administrative domains to which the
   MAG and the LMA belong.  The following are the three relevant
   deployment models.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.  the MAG and LMA are both in the home network,

   2.  the MAG and LMA are both in the visited network,

   3.  the MAG is in the visited network while the LMA is in the home
       network.

   session, which is located in the home network.  The MAG and LMA

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   MIP6-Feature-Vector</h3></a>

   Diameter [RFC3588] reserves AVP Code space 1-255 as RADIUS attribute
   compatibility space.  The MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute (Type value
   124) defined in [RFC5447] is of type OctetString and contains a
   64-bit flags field of supported mobility capabilities.  This document
   reserves two new capability bits according to the rules in [RFC5447],
   and reuses the PMIPv6 capability bits defined by [RFC5779].  The
   following capability flag bits are used or defined in this document:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PMIP6_SUPPORTED (0x0000010000000000)

      This capability bit is used as defined in [RFC5779].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IP4_HOA_SUPPORTED (0x0000020000000000)

      This capability bit is used as defined in [RFC5779].  Assignment
      of the IPv4-HoA (Home Address) is defined by [RFC5844].
   LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (0x0000040000000000)

      This capability bit is used as defined in [RFC5779].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IP4_TRANSPORT_SUPPORTED (0x0000800000000000)

      This capability bit is used for negotiation of the IPv4 transport
      support between the MAG and AAA.  When the MAG sets this flag bit
      in the MIP6-Feature-Vector, it indicates the ability of the MAG to
      provide IPv4 transport (i.e., IPv4-based encapsulation) for
      carrying IP traffic between the MAG and the LMA.  If this flag bit
      is unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute, the AAA
      does not authorize the use of IPv4 transport on the MAG-to-LMA
      tunnel.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   IP4_HOA_ONLY_SUPPORTED (0x0001000000000000)

      This capability bit is used for determination of the authorized
      PMIPv6 mobility mode.  When this bit is set by the AAA, it
      indicates PMIPv6 mobility with IPv4 support has only been
      authorized for the MN.  As a result, the RADIUS Access-Accept
      SHOULD NOT carry the IPv6 Home Network Prefix (IPv6 HNP).  When
      this bit is set, the PMIP6_SUPPORTED flag MUST also be set and the
      IP4_HOA_SUPPORTED flag MUST NOT be set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To summarize the use of the MIP6-Feature-Vector the following
   capability bit combination settings mean:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      PMIP6-SUPPORTED bit set - only IPv6 mobility is supported and
      authorized.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      PMIP6-SUPPORTED and IP4-ONLY-HOA-SUPPORTED bits set - only IPv4
      mobility is supported and authorized.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      PMIP6-SUPPORTED and IP4-HOA-SUPPORTED bits set - both IPv6 and
      IPv4 mobility are supported and authorized.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute is also used on the LMA to the
   RADIUS AAA interface.  This capability announcement attribute enables

   The Mobile-Node-Identifier attribute (Type value 145) is of type
   String and contains the mobile node identifier (MN-Identifier), see
   [RFC5213], in a form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282].
   This identifier and the identifier used for access authentication may
   be different; however, there needs to be a mapping between the two
   identities as specified in Section 6.6 of [RFC5213].  This attribute
   is used on the interface between the MAG and the AAA server.  The
   Mobile-Node-Identifier attribute is designed for deployments where
   the identity used during network access authentication and the
   identity used for mobility management is decoupled.  It may also be
   the case where the MAG does not have means to find out the MN
   identity that could be used in subsequent PBU and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) exchanges (e.g., due to identity hiding during
   the network access authentication) or when the HAAA wants to assign
   periodically changing identities to the MN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Mobile-Node-Identifier attribute MAY be returned by the HAAA in

   User-Name attribute SHOULD contain the MN's identity.  The LMA-
   provided identity in the User-Name attribute is strongly RECOMMENDED
   to be the same as the MN's identity information in the PBU MN-
   Identifier mobility option.  The identity SHOULD also be the same as
   used on the MAG-to-HAAA interface; however, in case those identities
   differ, the HAAA MUST have a mechanism of mapping the MN identity
   used on the MAG-to-HAAA interface to the identity used on the LMA-to-
   HAAA interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the PBU contains the MN Link-Layer Identifier option, the Calling-
   Station-Id attribute SHOULD be included in the request message
   containing the received MN Link-Layer Identifier option.
   Furthermore, if the PBU contains the Service Selection mobility
   option [RFC5149], the Service-Selection attribute SHOULD be included
   in the request message containing the received service identifier.
   Both the MN Link-Layer Identifier option and the service selection
   can be used to provide more information for the PBU authorization
   step in the HAAA.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Service-Type attribute MUST be set to the value 17 (Authorize
   Only).  If the HAAA is not able to authorize the subscriber's
   mobility service session, then the Access-Reject message to the LMA
   MAY contain the Reply-Message attribute describing the reason for
   rejecting the authorization.  A failed authorization obviously
   results in a rejection of the PBU, and a PBA with an appropriate
   error Status Value MUST be sent back to the MAG.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The authorization step MUST be performed at least for the initial PBU
   session up to a mobility session, when the LMA-to-HAAA interface is
   deployed.  For the subsequent re-registration and handover of PBUs,
   the authorization step MAY be repeated (in this case, the LMA-to-HAAA
   interface should also maintain an authorization session state).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In case of a dynamic LMA discovery and assignment [RFC6097], the HAAA
   and the remote policy store may need to be updated with the selected
   LMA address information.  The update can be done during the PBU
   authorization step using the LMA-to-HAAA interface.  This
   specification uses the PMIP6-*-LMA-*-Address attribute for carrying
   the LMA's address information from the LMA to the HAAA.  The LMA
   address information in the request message MUST contain the IP
   address of the LMA, the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) uniquely
   identifying the LMA, or both.  The LMA address information refers to
   the PMIPv6 part of the LMA, not necessarily the LMA part interfacing
   with the AAA infrastructure.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The LMA and the HAAA use the PMIP6-Home-HN-Prefix/
   PMIP6-Visited-HN-Prefix attributes to exchange the MN-HNP when
   appropriate.  Similarly, the LMA and the HAAA use the PMIP6-Home-
   IPv4-HoA/PMIP6-Visited-IPv4-HoA attributes to exchange the IPv4-MN-
   HoA when appropriate.  The MN address information exchange is again
   done during the PBU authorization step.  The HAAA MAY also use the
   LMA-provided MN address information as a part of the information used
   to authorize the PBU.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Which entity is actually responsible for the address management is
   deployment specific within the PMIPv6 Domain and MUST be pre-agreed
   on per deployment basis.  When the LMA is responsible for the address
   management, the PMIP6-*-HN-Prefix/PMIP6-*-IPv4-HoA attributes are
   used to inform the HAAA and the remote policy store of the MN-HNP/
   IPv4-MN-HoA assigned to the MN.  It is also possible that the LMA
   delegates the address management to the HAAA.  In this case, the
   MN-HNP/IPv4-MN-HoA are set to undefined addresses in the Access-
   Request message sent from the LMA to the HAAA.  The LMA expects to
   receive the HAAA assigned HNP/IPv4-MN-HoA in the corresponding
   Access-Accept message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.2"><h3>6.2   Table of Attributes</h3></a>

   Radius-based interfaces at the MAG and LMA with the AAA server
   enables the metering of traffic associated with the MN, commonly
   called "accounting".  If accounting is turned on in the mobile node's
   policy profile, the local routing SHOULD NOT be enabled [RFC5213].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1   Accounting at LMA</h3></a>

   The accounting at the LMA to AAA server interface is based on
   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  This interface MUST support the transfer of
   accounting records needed for service control and charging.  These
   records should include (but may not be limited to) the following:
   time of binding cache entry creation and deletion, number of the
   octets sent and received by the MN over the bi-directional tunnel,
   etc.
	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2   Accounting at MAG</h3></a>

   The accounting at the MAG to AAA server interface is based on
   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  The interface MUST also support the
   transfer of accounting records that should include the following:
   time of binding cache entry creation and deletion, number of the
   octets sent and received by the MN over the bi-directional tunnel,
   etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If there is data traffic between a visiting MN and a correspondent
   node that is locally attached to an access link connected to the same
   MAG, the mobile access gateway MAY optimize on the delivery efforts
   by locally routing the packets instead of using reverse tunneling to
   the mobile node's LMA.  In this case, the local data traffic too MUST
   be reported to AAA Accounting servers by means of RADIUS protocol.

	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   The RADIUS messages may be transported between the MAG and/or the LMA
   to the RADIUS server via one or more AAA brokers or RADIUS proxies.
   In this case, the communication between the LMA and the RADIUS AAA
   server relies on the security properties of the intermediate AAA
   brokers and RADIUS proxies.
   Regarding the privacy threats associated with sending MN-specific
   information between the MAG and AAA server and between the LMA and
   AAA server, considerations of the RADIUS Base protocol [RFC2865],
   RADIUS Accounting [RFC2866], and the RADIUS EAP application [RFC3579]
   are applicable to this document.  The MAG, LMA, and AAA server SHOULD
   avoid including attributes containing personally identifying
   information such as a MN's Interface ID, link-layer address, or NAI,
   except as needed and SHOULD pay special attention if identity hiding
   is desired.
