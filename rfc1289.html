<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This memo defines a set of DECnet Phase IV extensions that have been
   created for the Internet MIB.  When used in conjunction with the
   structure of management information (RFC 1155), the management
   information base for network management of TCP/IP-based internets
   (RFC 1213) and the Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1157), it
   will be possible to provide integrated network management of combined
   TCP/IP and DECnet Phase IV based internets.  This document was
   produced by the DECnet Phase IV MIB working group of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   With the adoption of The Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC
   1157), the management information base for network management of
   TCP/IP-based internets (RFC 1213), and the structure of management
   information (RFC 1155), by the Internet, and a large number of vendor
   implementations of these standards in commercially available
   products, it became possible to provide a higher level of effective
   network management in TCP/IP-based internets than previously
   available. With the growth in the use of these standards, network
   managers desired to use this environment as a base for providing
   integrated network management of multi-protocol networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DECnet Phase IV is one widely used protocol which often coexists in
   IP-based internets. This memo provides the mechanisms by which IP-
   based management stations can effectively manage DECnet Phase IV
   based systems (especially router products) in an integrated fashion
   through the use of the standard Internet SMI, MIB and Simple Network
   Management Protocol.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   DECnet Phase IV objects have been defined to be used in conjunction
   with the Internet MIB to allow access and control of these new
   objects by the Internet community. Additional support for other
   DECnet-based protocols such as RBMS (remote bridge management
   software) or other Digital Equipment Corporation Specific Hardware
   platforms is not included in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Selected Objects</h2></a>

   The objects included in this memo have been created from the DIGITAL
   Network Architecture Network Management Functional Specification
   Version 4.0.0 Dated July 1983. An attempt has been made to provide a
   reasonable ordering of these variables into groups. These groups are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     o  System Group

     o  Network Management Group

     o  Session Group

     o  End Group

     o  Routing Group

     o  Circuit Group

     o  DDCMP Group

     o  DDCMP Multipoint Control Group

     o  Ethernet Group

     o  Counters Group
     o  Adjacency Group

     o  Line Group

     o  Non Broadcast Line Group

     o  Area Group

   An effort has also been made to preserve the original syntax of the
   object wherever possible, for example, a DECnet Phase IV object is
   Executor State. This was originally coded as a NICE (Network
   Information and Control Exchange) data type which is a Coded single
   field object of 1 byte in length. When converted for inclusion into
   the Internet MIB using the Internet SMI, it became an enumerated
   integer.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Objects</h2></a>

   All objects in this memo are described using the standard Internet
   SMI and BER of RFC 1155. A complete description of an object will
   include the name, syntax and encoding. Just as with objects supported
   in the MIB (RFC 1156), an object name is identified with an object
   identifier which has been administratively assigned. This identifies
   an Object Type. When an object type is combined with a specific
   instance, the particular object is uniquely identified. The use of
   Object Descriptors in this memo is consistent with that of RFC 1156 -
   they are text strings meant to be read by humans. The descriptors
   have been taken from the original DIGITAL Network Architecture
   Network Management Functional Specification Version 4.0.0 Dated July
   1983 which defined DECnet Phase IV objects. These names were then
   massaged to put them in a form as consistent as possible with object
   type names listed in the standard Internet MIB. Object defintion
   information is also taken directly from the Network Architecture
   Network Managment Functional Specification cited above wherever
   possible. In this document, EXECUTOR is intended to reference only
   the DECnet software and is not intended to effect any other protocols
   which may be running on the system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Format of Definitions</h3></a>

   An object in this memo is specified by five fields of information:
   Object, Syntax, Definition, Access, and Status.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The OBJECT is a textual name (OBJECT DESCRIPTOR) for that object type
   combined with an administratively obtained OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   SYNTAX: For each object type, its abstract syntax is presented using
   the ASN.1 specified in RFC 1155.
   DEFINITION: A general description of the object type. Its original
   purpose in the DECnet Phase IV environment is given so that all
   implementers and users will consistently interpret the information
   contained in each object type. Changes in format to make the object
   consistent with RFC 1155 are also noted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   ACCESS: The standard access keywords supported in RFC 1156 are used.
   The keywords used in this MIB are: read-only, read-write, and, not-
   accessible.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   STATUS: The status field is used to describe with a single keyword
   whether the object type is mandatory or optional. Status keywords of
   obsolete and deprecated are not used in this memo since this is the
   first version of the DECnet Phase IV MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Textual Conventions</h3></a>

   New datatypes have been introduced as a textual conventions in this
   DECnet Phase IV MIB document. The purpose of these additions is to
   facilitate understanding of new objects in this MIB. No changes to
   the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support these conventions which
   are described in 4.0 (Object Definitions).

               A routing node has full routing capability. A

               routing modules. The III and IV indicate the DNA
               phase of the node. Nonrouting nodes can deliver
               and receive packets to and from any node, but cannot
               route packets from other nodes through to other nodes.
               An area node routes between areas. Refer to the Routing
               specification for details.
