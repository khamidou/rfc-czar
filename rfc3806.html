   This document describes an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) to
   provide for the management of in-line post-processing in a fashion
   that is currently provided for printers, using the Printer MIB
   [RFC3805].  The Printer Finishing MIB includes the following
   features:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Provides the status of the finishing device.
   -  Queries and controls the features and configuration of the
      finishing device.
   -  Enables and disables the finishing processes.
   -  Allows unsolicited status from the finishing device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Finisher MIB is defined as an extension of the Printer MIB
   [RFC3805] and it is expected that the information defined in this
   document will be incorporated into a future update of the Printer
   MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Scope</h3></a>

   This document provides a robust set of finishing devices, features,
   and functions, based upon today's state of the art of in-line
   finishing.  Since finishing typically accompanies higher speed
   network printers and copiers, in contrast to simple desktop devices,
   no attempt is made to limit the scope to "bare minimum".  On the
   other hand, the Printer Finishing MIB does not duplicate the
   production mail preparation, custom insertion, franking, and reprints
   that are covered by the DMTF Large Mailing Operations standard [LMO].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information supplied by the Printer Finishing MIB may be utilized by
   printer and finisher management applications engaged in monitoring
   status and managing configuration, and also used by print and
   finishing submission applications which are engaged in:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  print-job-level finishing processes that are applied to a complete
      print job,

   -  document-level finishing processes that are applied individually
      to each document in the print job,

   -  document-level finishing processes that are applied to a selected
      document in the print job.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Note that not all combinations of finishing processes are permitted.
   Compatible combinations of finishing processes are implementation
   specific.  The MIB allows invalid combinations to be identified.
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.2"><h3>1.2   Rational</h3></a>

   The Printer MIB [RFC3805] is now successfully deployed in a large
   segment of the network printer market.  SNMP and/or HTTP enabled
   printers and software management applications are growing in numbers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There is an increase in the availability of network printers and
   copiers that include in-line finishing processes.  Thus a well
   defined and ordered set of finishing objects is now necessary for
   printer management.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The printer model defined in the Printer MIB includes finishing
   processes and the MIB was designed to later incorporate finisher
   objects or to be referenced by a future Finisher MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.3"><h3>1.3   The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h3></a>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.4"><h3>1.4   Read-Write Objects</h3></a>

   Some objects in the Finisher MIB reflect the existence or amount of a
   given resource within the finisher.  Some examples of such resources
   are the size and number of sheets in an inserter tray or the
   existence of certain finisher options.  Some finishers have automatic
   sensors for these resources.  Most finishers lack sensors for every
   property of every resource.  The management application is allowed to
   write into objects that hold descriptive or existence values for
   finishers that cannot sense these values.  The ability to change the
   value of a read-write object may depend on the implementation of the
   agent.  Many objects in the MIB are given read-write access, but an
   implementation might only permit a management application to change
   the value if the finisher can not sense the value itself.  Note that
   even though some objects explicitly state the behavior of conditional
   ability to change values, any read-write object may act this way.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Generally, an object is given read-write access in the Finisher MIB
   specification if:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. The object involves installation of a resource that some finishers
      cannot themselves detect.  Therefore, external means are needed to
      inform the device of the installation.  (Here external means
      include using the operator console, or remote management
      application) and

   2. The finisher will behave differently if the installation of the
      resource is reported than if the installation were not reported;
      that is, the object is not to be used as a place to put
      information not used by the finisher, i.e., not a "sticky-note".
      Another way of saying this is that the finisher believes that
      information given it and acts as if the information were true.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. The finisher may get hints that it may not know about the
      existence or properties of certain resources.  For example, a
      paper tray may be removed and re-inserted.  When this removal and
      insertion happens, the finisher may either assume that a property,
      such as the size of paper in the tray, has not changed or the
      finisher may change the value of the associated object to
      "unknown", as might be done for the amount of paper in the tray.
      As long as the finisher acts according to the value in  the object
      either strategy is acceptable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or not MIB
      object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Terminology</h2></a>

   Where appropriate, the Printer Finishing MIB will conform to the
   terminology, syntax, and semantics from the DMTF Large Mailing
   Operations standard [LMO], the Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2911],
   and/or the ISO Document Printing Application [DPA].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   General Terminology</h3></a>

   Finisher Input:  An input tray on the finisher and not otherwise
   associated with the printer.  An example of a finisher input is a
   tray that holds finishing "inserts".

   Figure 2 - Finishing Process Axis Parallel to X Axis

   Finisher Output:  The output of the finisher.  Because processing is
    in-line, the finisher outputs are a direct extension of the set of
    printer outputs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Media Orientation:  All Finishing Processes are defined relative to a
    portrait orientation of the medium, regardless of the orientation of
    the printed image or the direction of feed.  The 'X' and 'Y' axis,
    therefore, will always reference the medium as shown in figures 1
    and 2, with the 'X' axis always along the short edge of the medium.
    All edges and corners are also defined with the medium orientation
    as shown using the syntax top, bottom, left, and right.  Thus the
    bottom edge of the medium is at Y = 0, the left edge is at X = 0,
    and the bottom right corner is at (X2,0) as shown in the figure 1
    and at (X3,0) as shown in figure 2.
   Finishing:  Defined by DPA as an operation on a document following
    the completion of the image process.  Finishing processes defined
    within this document are those applied to one or more instances of
    rectangular paper sheet media.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finishing Process:  Defined by DPA as an operation applied by a
    machine such as trimming a document, folding the sheets in a
    document, and applying a binding to a document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finishing Specification:  Defined by DPA as the specific sequence of
    operations for a serial combination of finishing processes.  The
    exact sequential order of the processes, in many cases, is critical
    to the obtaining the desired result.  For example, a folding
    operation followed by trimming could provide a very different result
    than if the trimming was followed by the folding.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Finishing Process Parameters:  This parameter set is used to create a
    detailed definition of the finishing process.  Generic Finishing
    Process Parameters are applicable to any Finishing Specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Head Mechanism:  Defined by DPA as the physical mechanism that is
      used to perform a finishing process.  The head position may be
      fixed or variable depending upon the capabilities of the device.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Reference Edge:  Defined by DPA as the edge of the document
      relative to the axis to which the finishing process is applied.
      The edge of the medium defined to be the Reference Edge may be
      either the 'X' or the 'Y' axis, depending upon the finishing
      process to be performed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Note that the Reference Edge may change from one finishing process
      to another for one of two reasons.  First, a subsequent process
      may require a different Reference Edge.  Second, the actual
      dimensions of the document may change, for example as a result of
      a folding or a trimming operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Jog Edge:  Defined by DPA as one of the two edges that is
      perpendicular to the Reference Edge.  Specifying the Jog Edge
      parameter indicates the edges of all sheets which correspond to
      the Jog Edge are aligned.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Finishing Process Axis:  Defined by DPA as the axis which some
      finishing processes are applied to or referenced from by the Head
      Mechanism.  Examples are the axis for a fold process or the axis
      for a punch process.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   -  Head Locations:  Defined by DPA as the position of the Heads on
      the Finishing Process Axis.
   -  Finishing Process Offset:  The offset from the Reference Edge to
      the Finishing Process Axis at which the finishing process takes
      place or is applied.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2   Process Specific Terminology</h3></a>

   FOLDING:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Z Fold:  A fold in which two folds are placed in the sheet in
     opposite directions.  The first fold is located at 25% of the sheet
     length, and the second is located at 50% of the sheet length (i.e.,
     the center of the sheet).  Z Folding is often used on 11x17 inch or
     A3 size sheets, when they are included in sets containing 8.5x11
     inch or A4 size sheets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Half Fold:  To fold a sheet in half so that one of the resulting
     dimensions are exactly half the original sheet.  Often used for
     signatures or booklets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Letter Fold:  Folding a sheet roughly in thirds.  Usually performed
     on 8.5x11 inch or A4 size sheets for insertion into an envelope.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Signature:  The process by which images are placed on a large sheet
     of paper in correct panel areas and in the proper orientation such
     that when the sheet is folded it will produce a booklet with each
     page in the proper order and orientation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   BINDING:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Adhesive Binding:  A method of attaching sheets together to form a
     book or booklet using glue or adhesive.  Some adhesive binding
     methods apply the glue to sheets individually, before merging them
     together for form a book, but most methods involve the application
     of adhesive to an entire book of sheets.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Comb Binding:  A method of binding in which a series of small
     rectangular holes is placed along the bind edge of the sheets.  The
     sheets are then held together using a tube shaped plastic binding
     strip with comb like fingers that fit through the holes in the

     the gutter between adjacent images.  This operation requires a
     minimum of two cuts for each gutter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Tab Cutting:  The act of cutting the edge of a sheet to form an index
     tab, thereby allowing quick identification and access.  The
     external tabs are sequentially placed along the book edge for
     visibility and ease of grasping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Perforating:  The act of cutting a series of very small, closely
     spaced holes or slots into a sheet to allow for ease of separation
     of a portion of the sheet.  Sometimes also used to ease
     bending/hinging of heavy weight papers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Scoring:  A means of applying small linear grooves or impressions
     along a sheet to allow easy folding.  Often used on heavy weight
     sheets and book covers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Slitting:  The action of cutting apart a large sheet to form smaller
     sheets.  Usually done using a sharp circular roll system.
   STITCHING/STAPLING:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Staple:  The process of binding a set of sheets together using a 'U'
     shaped piece of metal wire that is punched through the set.  The
     ends of the metal staple are then bent over, or 'clinched' to hold
     the staple in place.  Technically the term 'stapler' refers to
     devices that use pre-cut metal staples, but the term is also
     commonly used to refer to devices that use wire spools and then
     cut/form the staple.  (see the definition of Stitch)

   Stitch:  The process of binding a set of sheets together using a 'U'
     shaped piece of metal wire that is punched through the set.  The
     wire used to form the staple is cut and formed into a 'U' shape in
     the stitcher head, and the staple 'leg' length is often varied
     depending on the number of sheets to be bound together.  The ends
     of the metal staple are bent over, or 'clinched' to hold the staple
     in place.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     Stitching can also refer to the process of sewing the edges of the

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Saddle Stitch:  The process of stapling a set along its center line
     as part of a booklet making process.  Usually 2 or 3 staples are
     used.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Dual Stapling:  The process of placing 2 staples along the bind edge
     of a set.  The staples are typically located at 25% and 75% of the
     length of the bind edge.  Although dual stapling is often performed
     on the long edge of a set, legal documents are frequently dual
     stapled along the top, or short edge of the set.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Triple Stapling:  Same as above, but using 3 staples along the bind

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Finishing Specifications</h2></a>

   The Finisher MIB is able to provide most of the information that is
   required to generate a Finishing Specification.  This includes;

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. Finishing operations that can be performed on media that are
      associated with a specific printer media path and output subunit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. Combinations of operations that cannot be performed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   3. The location of the operation on the medium, if applicable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4. The physical characteristics of the result of the operation.  For
      example, the size and shape of a punched hole, or if a fold
      operation creates a letter fold or a "Z" fold.
   The Finisher MIB permits an agent to describe the order that
   operations can be performed.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   Multiple finDeviceTable Entries</h3></a>

   Each finishing operation supported by the printer is represented by
   one or more entries in the finDeviceTable.  Each entry in this table
   defines a "logical" finishing device, since the function of several
   table entries may be performed by a single finisher mechanism.
   Multiple entries may also exist in the table as a result of the
   existence of multiple finisher mechanisms that perform the same type
   of operation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   One example of possible multiple entries for a single finisher
   device, is a hole punch operation that creates more than one hole.
   This could be performed using a single die punch that moves to each
   required position or a multi-die punch that simultaneously creates
   all holes.  In either case, each defined hole position may be defined
   as a separate table entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In both cases, if the punch positions can be individually selected, a
   table entry for each position would be necessary.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   For the multi-die punch, each head mechanism may have a different
   hole pattern or size.  If these differences are to be properly
   disclosed, a table entry for each head mechanism would be required.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   Implicit Parameters</h3></a>

   Finishing operations that are specified by an enum define a standard

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   The Attribute Mechanism</h2></a>

   Attributes provide a function similar to information objects, except
   that attributes are identified by an enum, instead of an OID.  Thus
   new attributes may be registered without requiring a change to the
   MIB.  In addition, an implementation that does not have the
   functionality represented by the attribute can omit the attribute
   entirely, rather than having to return a distinguished value.  The
   agent is free to create an attribute in the Attribute Table as soon
   as the agent is aware of the value of the attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The agent materializes finishing subunit attributes in a four-indexed
   finDeviceAttributeTable:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. hrDeviceIndex - which device in the host

   2. finDeviceIndex - which finisher subunit in the printer device

   3. finDeviceAttributeTypeIndex - which attribute

   4. finDeviceAttributeInstanceIndex - which attribute instance for
      those attributes that can have multiple values per finishing
      subunit.
	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1   Conformance of Attribute Implementation</h3></a>

   An agent SHALL implement any attribute if (1) the device supports the<br>
   functionality represented by the attribute and (2) the information is<br>
   available to the agent.  The agent MAY create the attribute row in
   the finDeviceAttributeTable when the information is available or MAY
   create the row earlier with the designated 'unknown' value
   appropriate for that attribute.  See next section.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the device does not implement or does not provide access to the
   information about an attribute, the agent SHOULD NOT create the
   corresponding row in the finDeviceAttributeTable.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.2"><h3>5.2   Useful, 'Unknown', and 'Other' Values for Objects and Attributes</h3></a>

   Some attributes have a 'useful' Integer32 value, some have a 'useful'
   OCTET STRING value, some MAY have either or both depending on
   implementation, and some MUST have both.  See the
   finDeviceAttributeTypeTC textual convention for the specification of
   each attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE: In some instances, objects with a MAX-ACCESS of read-write will
   result in an SNMPv1 error or SNMPv2 exception during a write
   operation.  The administrative security policy may restrict a class
   of users to read-only or, more importantly, the implementation may
   implement a subset of read-write objects as read-only.  This should
   be expected to be the case for a device that can properly sense the
   value of an object and does not want the value to be externally
   modified.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In general, values for objects and attributes have been chosen so
   that a management application will be able to determine whether a
   'useful', 'unknown', or 'other' value is available.  When a useful
   value is not available for an object that agent SHALL return a zero-
   length string for octet strings, the value 'unknown(2)' for enums, a<br>
   '0' value for an object that represents an index in another table,
   and a value '-2' for counting integers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since each attribute is represented by a row consisting of both the
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger and finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets
   MANDATORY objects, SNMP requires that the agent SHALL always create
   an attribute row with both objects specified.  However, for most
   attributes the agent SHALL return a "useful" value for one of the
   objects and SHALL return the 'other' value for the other object.  For
   integer only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a zero-length
   string value for the finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets object.  For
   octet string only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a '-1'
   value for the finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger object.
	<a name="section-5.3"><h3>5.3   Data Sub-types and Attribute Naming Conventions</h3></a>

   Many attributes are sub-typed to give a more specific data type than
   Integer32 or OCTET STRING.  The data sub-type of each attribute is
   indicated on the first line(s) of the description.  Some attributes
   have several different data sub-type representations.  When an
   attribute has both an Integer32 data sub-type and an OCTET STRING
   data sub-type, the attribute can be represented in a single row in
   the finDeviceAttributeTable.  In this case, the data sub-type name is
   not included as the last part of the name of the attribute.  When the
   data sub-types cannot be represented by a single row in the
   finDeviceAttributeTable, each such representation is considered a
   separate attribute and is assigned a separate name and enum value.
   For these attributes, the name of the data sub-type is the last part
   of the name of the attribute.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4   Single-Value (Row) Versus Multi-Value (MULTI-ROW) Attributes</h3></a>

   Most attributes shall have only one row per finishing subunit.
   However, a few attributes can have multiple values per finishing
   subunit, where each value is a separate row in the
   finDeviceAttributeTable.  Unless indicated with 'MULTI-ROW:' in the
   finDeviceAttributeTypeTC description, an agent SHALL ensure that each
   attribute occurs only once in the finDeviceAttributeTable for a
   finishing subunit.  Most of the 'MULTI-ROW' attributes do not allow
   duplicate values, i.e., the agent SHALL ensure that each value occurs
   only once for a finishing subunit.  Only if the specification of the
   'MULTI-ROW' attribute also says "There is no restriction on the same
   xxx occurring in multiple rows" can the agent allow duplicate values
   to occur for a single finishing subunit.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.5"><h3>5.5   Linked MUTI-ROW Values</h3></a>

   Some MULTI-ROW attributes are intended to go together.  Thus a set of
   value instances represent a single instance.  For example, the
   puncher attributes indicate the location, maximum size, minimum size
   and shape of the various holes that the puncher can produce.  So the
   first set of values could represent one kind of hole, and the second
   set another kind of hole, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.6"><h3>5.6   Index Value Attributes</h3></a>

   A number of attributes are indexes in other tables.  Such attribute
   names end with the word 'Index'.  If the agent has not (yet) assigned
   an index value for a particular index attribute for a finishing
   subunit, the agent shall either: (1) return the value 0 or (2) not<br>
   add this attribute to the finDeviceAttributeTable until the index
   value is assigned.  In the interests of brevity, the semantics for 0
   is specified once here and is not repeated for each index attribute
   specification and a DEFVAL of 0 is indicated.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.7"><h3>5.7   Attribute Specifications</h3></a>

   This section specifies the set of attributes that are enumerated in
   finAttributeTypeTC.  The data type tag definitions 'INTEGER:'  or
   'OCTETS', indicate if the attribute can be represented using the
   object finDeviceAttributeAsInteger or the object
   finDeviceAttributeAsOctets, respectively.  In some cases, a choice
   between the two data types is possible and for a few attributes both
   objects may be required at the same time to properly present the
   value.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   NOTE - The enum assignments are grouped logically with values
   assigned in groups of 10, so that additional values may be registered
   in the future and assigned a value that is part of their logical
   grouping.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Values in the range 2**30 to 2**31-1 are reserved for private or

	<a name="section-6"><h2>6.   Enumerations</h2></a>

   Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined for use with
   one or more objects.  Commonly used enumeration sets are assigned a
   symbolic data type name (textual convention), rather than being
   specified in the SYNTAX clause of each individual object definition.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Textual conventions defined in the Finisher MIB or the companion IANA
   Finisher MIB are extensible by RFC publication or Designated Expert
   Review (see 'IANA Considerations' section of this Finisher MIB and
   the DESCRIPTION clause in MODULE-IDENTITY of IANA Finisher MIB).  All
   of these textual conventions are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   a) used more than once in the Finisher MIB itself; or

   b) imported and used in any other, including vendor private, MIB
      modules.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Finisher MIB has also defined the following special values for
   use with objects of the syntax "Integer32" to define conditions that
   are outside of the normal numeric range:  other(-1), unknown(-2), and
   partial(-3).  The 'partial' value means that there is some supply
   remaining (but the amount is indeterminate) or there is some capacity
   remaining (but the amount is indeterminate).  The Integer32 range
   field indicates in which objects these special values are valid.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-6.1"><h3>6.1   Registering Additional Enumerated Values</h3></a>

   The Finisher MIB and the companion IANA Finisher MIB each defines one
   category of textual convention, according to the process employed to
   control the addition of new enumerations:
      Type 1 - All of the legal values are defined in the Finisher MIB.
      Additional enumerated values require the publication of a new
      Finisher MIB.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Type 2 - All of the legal values are registered in the IANA
      Finisher MIB.  Additional enumerated values require a Designated
      Expert Review defined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA
      Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC2434].  The Designated Expert
      will be selected by the IETF Area Director(s) of the Applications
      Area.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module

   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Where the operational capability of the printing device are
   especially vulnerable or difficult to administer, certain objects
   within this MIB have been tagged as READ-ONLY, preventing
   modification. Further, for all READ-WRITE objects within the MIB, the
   working group has included specific conformance guidelines stating
   that vendors are free to implement certain objects as READ-ONLY. This
   conformance allowance should cover cases where specific vendor
   vulnerabilities may differ from product to product. (See conformance
   section with regards to MIN-ACCESS clauses).
