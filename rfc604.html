RFC # 604                                               MITRE

                         Assigned Link Numbers

This announcement modifies the official host-to-host protocol, and
updates the defining documents [NIC 8246, NIC 9347].  Please note that
the information on page 28 of "Host/Host Protocol for the ARPA Network"
about link number assignments is updated by this note, and that a
previous update [RFC 317, NIC 9347] is completely replaced.  The
modification is minor and should have no effect on existing network
programs or usage.  Four of the reserved link numbers are hereby
assigned for experimental use in the testing of an internetworking
protocol defined by Kahn and Cerf.
