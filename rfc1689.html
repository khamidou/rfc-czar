	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.    Introduction</h2></a>

   As the network has grown, along with it there has been an increase in
   the number of software tools and applications to navigate the network
   and make use of the many, varied resources which are part of the
   network.  Within the past two and a half years we have seen a
   widespread adoption of tools such as the archie servers, the Wide
   Area Information Servers (WAIS), the Internet gopher, and the
   Worldwide Web (WWW).  In addition to the acceptance of these tools
   there are also diverse efforts to enhance and customise these tools
   to meet the needs of particular network communities.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   There are many organisations and associations that are focusing on
   the proliferating resources and tools for networked information
   retrieval (NIR).  The Networked Information Retrieval Group is a
   cooperative effort of three major players in the field of NIR: The
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Association of European
   Research Networks (RARE) and the Coalition for Networked Information
   (CNI), specifically tasked to collect and disseminate information
   about the tools and to discuss and encourage cooperative development
   of current and future tools.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The purpose of this report is to increase the awareness of NIR by
   bringing together in one place information about the various
   networked information retrieval tools, their developers, interested
   organisations, and other activities that relate to the production,
   dissemination, and support of NIR tools.  The intention is to make
   this a "living document".  It will be held on-line so that each
   section may be updated separately as appropriate.  In addition, it is
   intended that the full document will be updated once a year so that
   it provides a "snapshot" report on activities in this area.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Whilst the NIR tools in this report are being used on a wide variety
   of information sources including files and databases there remains
   much that is currently not accessible by these means.  On the other
   hand, the majority of the NIR Tools described here are freely
   available to the networked Research and Education community.  Tools
   for accessing specialised datasets are often only available at a
   cost.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It should be noted that in many ways networked information retrieval
   is in its infancy compared with traditional information retrieval
   systems.  Thesaurus construction, boolean searching and
   classification control are issues which are under discussion for the
   popular NIR Tools but as yet are not in widespread use.  However it
   should be said that, with the vast amount of effort that is currently
   going into the NIR field, rapid progress is being made.  Much work is
   currently being done on expanding some of the NIR tools to include
   handling of multimedia information services.  Progress has also been
   made in the discussions on classifying and cataloguing electronic
   information resources.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   How the information was collected</h2></a>

   The information contained in this report was collected over the
   network from the contacts for each NIR Tool or Group using two
   templates:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     - the NIR Tool Template, included in Appendix A;
     - the NIR Group Template, included in Appendix B.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The contents of these templates were discussed by the NIR WG in
   Boston (July, 1992) and subsequently on the email list.  (See the
   Section on the NIR-WG for details of how to join this mailing list.)
   The initial draft report was discussed at the NIR Working Group in
   Washington (November, 1992) and updated and added to at subsequent WG
   meetings.  Before the final submission as an RFC the individual
   templates were reviewed by independent reviewers from around the
   world.  Their efforts are acknowledged in Section 9.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NIR Tool template was used to collect the information necessary
   to identify and track the development of networked information
   retrieval tools.  This template asked for information such as how and
   where to get the software for each NIR Tool, documentation,
   demonstration sites, etc.  The main part of the template has been
   completed by the main individual responsible for the tool.  Sections
   of the template (e.g., on clients) may have required completion by
   others.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The NIR Group template requested information on the aim and purpose
   of the group, the current tasks being undertaken, mailing lists,
   document archives, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   What is covered?</h2></a>

	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.   Overview of the types of NIR Tools</h2></a>

   The following is an overview of major networked information retrieval
   (NIR) tools available on the Internet.  There are many excellent
   books which discuss the Internet and NIR Tools in detail.  Such books
   include "The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" by Ed Krol and
   published by O'Reilly and Associates, Inc and "The Internet Guide for
   New Users" by Daniel Dearn and published by Meckler.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The number of these NIR tools is large and growing quickly.  Certain
   techniques reappear regularly and seemingly different tools may
   perform similar tasks, allowing a simple classification of projects
   encompassing most of the existing tools and services.
   The classification presented here is only one possible ordering.  The
   goal is to define in broad outlines what can be done with particular
   tools, realizing that users will always find novel unanticipated ways
   of applying them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interactive Information Delivery Services (Gopher, World Wide Web)

      Basic Internet services such as electronic mail and anonymous FTP
      can be used to share information across the Internet, but neither
      allows simple browsing and neither is particularly easy for the
      newcomer to learn to use.  Gopher and the World Wide Web (W3) are
      two recent developments that attempt to make it easier to
      distribute information over the Internet.  Both allow the user to
      browse information across the network without the necessity of
      logging in or knowing in advance where to look for information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Gopher project was first developed at the University of
      Minnesota to provide a simple campus-wide on-line information
      system.  Gopher represents information as a simple hierarchy of
      menus and files.  It has limited capability to recognize different
      types of files, allowing, for example, the display of selected
      types of image files.  Gateways to other services are provided
      (usually in a manner that is transparent to the user).  The
      underlying Gopher protocol is simple, and has facilitated the
      creation of freely available clients for use on a variety of
      hardware platforms and operating systems.  The more recent Gopher+
      protocol adds the ability to provide documents in alternate forms
      (PDF, PostScript, RTF, Word).  These features and the ease of
      installing and administering gopher servers has led to an
      explosive growth of gopher sites since its initial deployment.  As
      of November 1993, there were over 2200 known servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      World Wide Web relies on hypertext; formatted documents are
      displayed, and hypertext links within the document can be selected
      to travel from the current document to another.  W3 allows a user
      to annotate documents (using hypertext links), provides gateways
      to other services, and has multimedia support (for example, on
      appropriate hardware platforms it can intermix text and images in
      a displayed document).  There is a range of free W3 clients,
      supporting many environments.  World Wide Web was originally
      developed at CERN for the High Energy Physics Community.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Gopher and WWW share a maintenance problem in that there is no
      automated way to update links to other documents when those
      documents are moved or removed.
   Directory Services (WHOIS, X.500)

      Directory Service tools are intended to provide a lookup service
      for locating information about users (often referred to as White
      Pages), or services and service providers (Yellow Pages).  For
      example, a White Pages service might be used to locate an
      electronic mail address, given a name and organization, while a
      Yellow Pages service could be used to locate an online library
      catalog or file archive site.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      One of the first directory services deployed on the Internet was
      WHOIS, a simple White Pages service created to track key network
      contacts for the early DARPA-sponsored incarnation of the
      Internet.  A number of sites currently operate WHOIS servers,
      based on a range of extensions and enhancements to the original
      model.  WHOIS enjoys the advantages of simplicity and the presence
      of WHOIS client software on a preponderance of Internet-connected
      hosts.  Work is underway on a more powerful protocol, known as
      WHOIS++, which is backwards-compatible with WHOIS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The X.500 Directory Service is a much more ambitious Directory
      project that has been under development for a number of years
      under the aegis of ISO/OSI.  Implementations, concerned primarily
      with White pages services, are available in the public domain and
      from commercial sources.  There are LDAP based X.500 clients
      available for most major platforms, as well as a LDAP based gopher
      gateway to X.500.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Despite years of effort, there is still no single White Pages
      Directory Service for the entire Internet; Yellow Pages services
      remain even less well developed and deployed.  The cost of setting
      up the service is one obstacle; maintaining the required databases
      is even more daunting.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Indexing Services (archie, Veronica, online library catalogs)

      There are several Internet-based projects that build indexed
      catalogs of information to facilitate searching and retrieval.
      The first such services provided network access to library card
      catalogs, with more recent projects indexing network-based
      information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   archie:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie service began as a simple project to catalog the
      contents of hundreds of ftp-accessible online file archives.  The
      archie service gathers location information, name, and other
      details describing such files and creates an index database.
      Users can contact an archie server and search this database for
      files they require.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie service is accessible through a range of access
      methods, including telnet, stand-alone client programs running on
      a user's own machine, gopher, WWW, or via electronic mail.  The
      initial implementation of archie tracks over 2,100,000 filenames
      on over 1,200 sites around the world (as of November 1993).  There
      are about 30 (geographically distributed) archie servers.  Both
      commercial and freely available versions of the archie client
      software are available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Work continues on extending the archie service to provide
      additional types of information.  The latest version is being used
      to provide a prototype Yellow Pages service and directories of
      online library catalogs and electronic mailing lists.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Veronica:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Veronica arose as an attempt to do for the world of Gopher what
      archie did for the world of ftp.  A central server periodically
      scans the complete menu hierarchies of Gopher servers appearing on
      an ever-expanding list (over 2000 sites as of November 1993).  The
      resulting index is provided by a veronica server and can be
      accessed by any gopher client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Online library catalogs:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A large number of libraries make their computerized library
      catalogs available over the Internet.  Most are available through
      telnet sessions in which the user connects to a specific address
      and logs in using a specific login name.  Some are also available
      through other tools, such as Gopher.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Text-based Indexing Services (WAIS)

   WAIS:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) is a system for indexing and
      serving information in a network-based environment.  It is
      distinct from indexing tools such as archie and veronica in that
      it is used to index text-based target documents on a server, as
      well as descriptions of the contents of a server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A WAIS server allows the administrator to set up an index of the
      documents (or resources) to be published.  The user employs a WAIS
      client to attach to a particular WAIS server, and specifies a
      search pattern which is matched against the server's index.  In
      early WAIS clients, searches are specified as simple natural-
      language queries; common ("stop") words are removed, and Boolean
      "ORs" are implicitly added between the remaining list of words.
      Matching documents are rank-ordered according to a simple
      statistical weighting scheme which attempts to indicate likely
      relevance.  The user may choose to view selected documents, or
      further refine the search.  The results of one search may be used
      to successively refine future searches ("relevance feedback").
      Gopher clients can also access WAIS servers via a transparent
      gateway.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Both freely available and commercial versions of WAIS servers and
      clients are available.  Current work is attempting to add Boolean
      expressions and proximity and field specifications to queries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There are currently (as of November 1993) some 500 registered WAIS
      databases with an estimated 2000 additional databases that are not
      yet registered.  There are approximately another 100 commercial
      WAIS databases.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 NIR Tool Name:      Alex

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   OVERVIEW:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Alex filesystem provides users and applications transparent
      read access to files in anonymous FTP sites on the Internet.
      Today there are thousands of anonymous FTP sites with a total of a
      few millions of files and roughly a terabyte of data.  The
      standard approach to accessing these files involves logging in to
      the remote machine.  This means that an application can not access
      remote files like local files.  This also means that users do not
      have any of their aliases or local tools available.  Users who
      want to use an application on a remote file first have to manually
      make a local copy of the file.  There is no mechanism for
      automatically updating this local copy when the remote file
      changes.  The users must keep track of where they get their files
      from and check to see if there are updates, and then fetch these.
      In this approach many different users at the same site may have
      made copies of the same remote file each using up disk space for
      the same data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Alex addresses the problems with the existing approach while
      remaining within the existing FTP protocol so that the large
      collection of currently available files can be used.  To get
      reasonable performance long term file caching is used.  Thus
      consistency is an issue.  Traditional solutions to the cache
      consistency problem do not work in the Internet FTP domain:
      callbacks are not an option as the FTP protocol has no provisions
      for this and polling over the Internet is slow.  Therefore, Alex
      relaxes file cache consistency semantics, on a per file basis, and
      uses special caching algorithms that take into account the
      properties of the files and of the network to allow a simple
      stateless filesystem to scale to the size of the Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   USER'S VIEW:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To a user or application, Alex is just a normal filesystem.  Any
      command that works on local files will work on Alex files.  Since
      Alex is a real filesystem, nothing needs to be recompiled and no
      libraries are changed.  Thus, users can apply all of their
      existing skills and tools for using files.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The user sees a filesystem with a hierarchical name space.  At the
      top level (/alex) there are top-level Internet domains like "edu",
      "com", "uk", and "jp".  Each component of the hostname becomes a
      directory name. Then the remote path is added at the end.  If the
      user does a "ls /alex/edu/berkeley" he sees some machine names
      such as "ucbvax" and "sprite" and some directories on
      berkeley.edu.  From the "ls" it is not clear what is where.  The
      user may or may not be aware of host boundaries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   INFORMATION PROVIDER'S VIEW:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Alex is implemented as a user level NFS server.  NFS was chosen
      because it makes it easy to add Alex to a wide range of machines.
      Most machines can simply use the mount command.
      The model of usage is that there is one Alex server running at
      each institution (though this is not required in any way).  Users
      mount the local server which caches files for users at that site.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Any information put into any anonymous FTP site becomes available
      via Alex.

 NIR Tool Name:                  archie

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The archie system is a tool for gathering, indexing and serving
   information from around the Internet.  The current version serves a
   collection of filenames found at anonymous FTP sites, as well as a
   smaller collection of text descriptions for software, data and other
   information found at anonymous FTP archives.  Additional databases
   are under development.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   User's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Users run a client program to connect to an archie server and
      issue search commands to find information in an archie database.
      In the case of an anonymous FTP filename, this information can
      then be used to fetch the file directly from the archive site
      using the `ftp' command.  To the user, archie could be seen as a
      `secondary source' of information which, because of the high cost
      of locating and serving, would not otherwise be available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The user searches the archie databases through either a telnet
      session to a machine running an archie server, or by using a
      stand-alone client program (which uses the Prospero protocol for
      sending and receiving requests).  There is also an email interface
      which allows users to send and receive search requests via
      electronic mail.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Freely available archie clients exist for most operating systems
      and can be fetched using anonymous FTP from most of the current
      archie servers.  There are also gateways to the archie system from
      many other NIR tools, including Gopher, WAIS and WWW.  An X.500
      interface to archie is currently under development.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information Provider's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      There are two types of information providers who would be
      interested in archie.  Primary information providers are
      interested in having a summary of the information provided by
      their service tracked by an archie server.  Secondary service
      providers, or those sites wishing to provide a "value-added"
      service for the Internet can elect to run an archie server at
      their site to provide a useful service to users, to raise the
      profile of their institution on the Internet, or to provide market
      differentiation (for commercial service providers).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie system is of particular utility serving information
      where there are many sites to be searched and/or where the cost of
      searching each site is high.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      For example, there are currently over 1,200 anonymous FTP sites on
      the Internet, and the number continues to grow.  Searching for a
      specific filename at a single site may involve scanning hundreds,
      or even thousands of filenames.  Thus, most operators of anonymous
      FTP archives welcome the fact that archie indexes and serves the
      names of all files available from each site tracked.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information Types Supported:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie system allows the gathering and serving of arbitrary
      information types, although the current system serves only
      freeform text and a dedicated text format for filename listings.
      Internally, the archie system now supports a WAIS search engine
      and frontends for Gopher, WWW and WHOIS++ for accessing archie
      information through Gopher clients is now being tested.
      Additional collections of information to be served by the archie
      software will be announced.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Protocols:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   What is supported:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The current archie system clients use the Prospero protocol for
      communication with the search engine on the archie server.  Freely
      available clients are available which include source to perform
      this communication for those wishing to implement additional
      clients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie server is capable of building arbitrary databases,
      using arbitrary search and access engines and the current release
      ships with the public domain implementation of WAIS.  We expect
      future archie servers to serve information using this protocol.
      The current server system assumes the TCP/IP protocol suite is
      available, and in particular the ftp protocol for data gathering.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie system can be accessed through systems operating the
      Gopher, WAIS and WWW (HDDL) protocols.  A gateway from the X.500
      system is under development.
   What it runs over:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The Prospero protocol implementation runs over its own
      implementation of a reliable datagram protocol based upon UDP.
      Data gathering runs over the TCP/IP protocol suite.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Other NIR tools this interworks with:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Prospero, Gopher, WAIS, WWW.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Future plans:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The archie system became a commercial product in October, 1992,
      marketed by Bunyip Information Systems Inc.  The company plans to
      market additional data gathering modules to allow the server code
      to build additional types of databases.  Work is also underway to
      integrate extensions to WHOIS to allow the building and
      maintaining of White Pages (names) directories.  The company is
      also working on other Internet information tools that will work
      with the archie system.

 NIR Tool Name:  Internet Gopher

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Internet Gopher protocol is a client/distributed-server document
   search and retrieval protocol originally developed at the University
   of Minnesota.  Gopher was originally created as a fast, simple,
   distributed, campus-wide information search and retrieval system;
   ease of use and implementation has made Gopher increasingly popular
   on the Internet.  Since its original release, many folks on the
   Internet have contributed to its growth, submitting patches, servers,
   clients, and linking their local servers into the worldwide network
   of Gopher servers.  Gateways exist to seamlessly access a variety of
   non-Gopher services such as ftp, WAIS, USENET news, Archie, Z39.50
   (1992 rev), X.500 directories, Sybase and Oracle SQL servers, etc.
   In addition, an "archie for gopherspace" called Veronica (very easy
   rodent-oriented net-wide index to computerized archives) has been
   developed at the University of Nevada.  Veronica makes it easy to
   search for items in gopherspace by title.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The gopher protocol is often described as "fiercely simple"; it is
   connectionless (stateless), and uses TCP reliable streams.  A client
   connects to a server using TCP, and sends a one-line text "selector
   string".  The server responds by returning the item (a file, a
   directory listing, or a link to some other service) corresponding to
   the selector string and immediately closing the connection.  Items in
   directory listings are returned as a series of lines terminated by
   carriage-return line-feed.  Each item (line) is defined by a one-
   character tag to specify the item type, a display string or item-name
   that the client should display to the user, and a number of tab
   delimited fields to specify the selector string, host domain name and
   port number.  Because of its simple and connectionless nature, gopher
   servers make very minimal demands on their host machines and gopher
   clients are extremely easy to implement.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The users view the Gopher world as a series of networked hierarchical
   directories much like a familiar filesystem.  However, the links
   define a graph rather than a simple rooted tree.  Links in the Gopher
   graph may define services other than simple files or directories;
   these include cso (qi) servers, telnet sessions, links to other
   gopher servers, and links to gateway servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The information provider's simplest view is that files and
   directories below a certain root directory on their machine are all
   visible and available for retrieval by gopher clients.  More features
   like long names, item types, links, and gateway services are
   available to the more sophisticated information provider.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Servers and clients run on most popular hardware, including Macs,
   UNIX boxes, PC-DOS boxes.  The Internet Gopher name is copyright (c)
   1991-1992 by the University of Minnesota.  The Internet Gopher
   protocol is described in an informational RFC (1436) available at<br>
   better RFC archives everywhere.  Extensions to the base gopher
   protocol allow for associating meta-information with gopher items,
   alternate views of documents (i.e., text, postscript, rtf, etc.) and
   electronic forms.  Collectively, these extensions are referred to as
   Gopher+.  Gopher+ is upward compatible with the orginal gopher
   protocol.  The gopher software may be retrieved from numerous Gopher
   or FTP archive sites, including the University of Minnesota Gopher
   server, the Info-Mac Archive Gopher server, and by anonymous FTP from
   boombox.micro.umn.edu and sumex-aim.stanford.edu. As of December
   1993, about 1/3 of the approximately 4800 Gopher servers on the
   internet support Gopher+.

 NIR Tool Name: Netfind

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Given the name of a person on the Internet and a rough description of
   where the person works, Netfind attempts to locate information about
   the person.  People can be specified by first, last, or login name.
   Their place of work can be described by name and/or the
   city/state/country.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Netfind provides textual information about people, when it is able to
   locate such information.  It is not a directory in the usual sense of
   the word.  Rather, it searches for people using a number of Internet
   services and heuristics about how to locate user information.
   Because of the techniques it uses, Netfind can locate information
   about more people than any other Internet user directory - over 5
   million people in over 9,000 domains worldwide when last measured.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   You can use the University of Colorado Netfind server by telnet to
   bruno.cs.colorado.edu: login as "netfind" (with no password).  Help
   screens providing more detailed instructions and technical
   information are available there.  There is currently no way for non-
   Internet users to access Netfind (e.g., using an email interface).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  There are an increasing number of Netfind servers being set up at

 NIR Tool Name: Prospero

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Prospero directory service supports a user centered view of files
   scattered across the Internet.  It can be used to organize references
   to files as if they were on your local system, without the need to
   physically move them.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Prospero provides access to existing directories and indices that can
   be used to find files of interest that are available from Internet
   archive sites.  Among the indices available is the archie database
   and a gateway to all Gopher menus, files, and searches.  We hope to
   have WAIS indices and World Wide Web documents online in the near
   future.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Prospero also provides a mechanism to make directories and indices
   available to end-users and applications in a format that allows
   information from different sources to be integrated into a coherent
   whole.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Prospero does not interpret the data that it organizes.  It does
   provide mechanisms to retrieve the data, but the display and use of
   the data is up to the user's application.  Prospero is intended to
   serve as infrastructure that integrates information from a variety of
   sources and supports a variety of user applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Prospero allows fine grained authorization of requests to all
   objects, including directories and indices.  Prospero supports the
   authentication of clients through four mechanisms: (a) simple client
   assertion of the user's identity; (b) a trusted port mechanism
   similar to that used by the Berkeley UNIX R commands; (c) a simple
   cleartext passwording mechanism; (d) Kerberos (version 5).  The
   maintainer of an ACL chooses which of these mechanisms he or she
   wishes to accept as proof of the client's identity.

  Brief Scope and Characteristics:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The server allows the maintainer to make directory information
   available about selected portions of the server's filesystem, such as
   anonymously FTPable files.  The server also is used to publish
   information from other databases, such as Archie.  The server also
   allows users and maintainers to store their own customized organizing

  Brief Scope and Characteristics:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We provide two client interfaces.  The older one is a command-line
   client, which can be configured to use the same syntax to navigate
   through the Prospero namespace that a user uses to navigate through
   the UNIX filesystem.  ("cd", "ls", etc.) The newer one is a menu-
   based file and directory browser similar to the UNIX Gopher client.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  General comments:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Archie clients also make queries in the Prospero namespace, so all
   Archie clients are Prospero clients too.  They are better described
   in the Archie report.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Future plans:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   We are working on enhancing the menu browser client to allow users to
   remotely customize and update virtual systems.  We plan to develop a

  Gopher, WAIS, Archie, and World Wide Web.  The paper was

  This is the first paper we give to more general computer science
  audiences to read.  It's also a good first paper to look at.  It
  gives a good overview of Prospero and what it does.  It also
  describes a bit about the Virtual System model, of which Prospero is
  a prototype implementation.  Describes what Prospero does, not how
  it does it.

  This is a good third paper to read about Prospero.  This one is
  targeted more toward system implementors.  It provides more
  implementation details than the paper on organizing Internet
  resources, but less of the vision of how Prospero can be used together
  with other systems.

  This paper describes the reasons that operating systems need to
  support closure, that is they need to make it clear which name space
  is to be used when resolving names.  While closure is one of the
  important features of Prospero, the concept should be applied in other
  operating systems too.

 Other Information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  We provide three documented library interfaces to Prospero in order to
  make client writing easy.
  The PFS and PCOMPAT libraries are documented in the library reference
  manual.  The PFS library allows one to directly make Prospero requests
  and parse the results and to manipulate Prospero objects as
  abstractions.  The PCOMPAT library is an interface to the PFS library
  which uses the same interface as the UNIX filesystem; one can link
  many existing programs with the PCOMPAT library in order to get it to
  resolve names in the Prospero namespace.  It is not as portable as the
  PFS library and does not provide as much functionality.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The third library interface is the menu-browser API library.  It is
  documented in the menu-based browser API manual and is used by our
  menu-based browser.

 NIR Tool Name:  veronica

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   veronica: Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized
             Archives.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   veronica is the comprehensive title-index of the world's gopher
   servers.  Because of veronica, the Gopher web is a search-and-
   retrieval system as well as a browsing system.  veronica is popular
   because the ubiquitous Gopher client can both access the search
   server, and provide immediate access to the discovered resources.
   Taking advantage of Gopher's linked menus, and of the policy of open
   access at most gopher sites, veronica finds and indexes almost all
   items on publicly-accessible gopher servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As of February, 1994, veronica holds indexes to more than 3200 gopher
   servers on approximately 2500 internet hosts.  In February 1994 the
   public-access veronica sites served an estimated 1,200,000 queries.
   Most queries are resolved in less than twenty seconds.  Eight server
   sites offer searches to the internet community, and several other
   institutions run servers for internal access.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   veronica is easily accessed via any Gopher client.  It offers various
   types of searches, ranging from single-keyword searches to boolean
   queries of indefinite complexity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A veronica search originates with a user's request for a search,
   submitted from a gopher client.  The searches may include boolean
   operators ( AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses ) and several options to
   control the number of items returned, and to restrict the search to
   certain gopher types.  The result of a veronica search is a set of
   gopher-type data items, which is returned to the gopher client as a
   gopher menu.  Each item on this menu contains the user's desired
   keyword or keywords in the item title.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The user can access any of the gopher items by selecting from the
   returned menu.  Items on this menu may be drawn from many gopher
   servers.  Because veronica is accessed through gopher clients, it
   provides immediate access to all types of data supported by the
   gopher protocol and the client implementation.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The veronica service comprises two functions:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1) Harvesting menu data from gopher servers, and preparing it for
      use;
   2) Offering searches of that database to gopher clients.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   These two functions are not necessarily provided by the same host
   computer.  Currently collection and preparation of data are done at
   University of Nevada, and datasets are distributed to the other
   veronica servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The veronica service infrastructure has been fairly stable since
   July, 1993, with eight server sites offering searches for the
   internet community (March 1994).  These servers are supported by the
   participating institutions: NYSERNET, PSI, SERRA, CNIDR, University
   of Koeln, SUNET, University of Bergen and the University of Nevada
   System Computing Services.  Several additional servers offer searches
   with access limited to internal users; in this class are servers at
   MSU, SUNET, and the Australian University system.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An auxiliary tool to build a locally held menu of Public available
   has been created.  Called "maltshop", it has been distributed since
   January, 1994.  It appears that maltshop is rapidly being accepted,
   but its long-term effect on loading of the servers may be
   problematic.

  Brief Scope and Characteristics:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Two modules:    a data-collection module and a data-server module.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1.      Data-collector runs on any Unix computer that does TCP
           and compiles perl.  This has not been distributed yet.
           Data collection, data preparation, and indexing are being
           done at veronica.scs.unr.edu.  The harvester "walks" all
           advertised gopher servers, and any newly-discovered servers.
           Almost all redundant links are removed, leaving the
           ( hopefully ) canonical reference for each item.
           Indexes are built at Nevada, and the indexed dataset is
           distributed to server sites.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2.      Server module.
           Servers run on unix computers and answer to gopher-type-7
           requests.  Boolean keyword logic is implemented.  See file
           "how-to-compose-veronica-queries".  Several options allow
           retrieval of items with specified gopher-types, retrieval
           of a file of links containing the search results, and
           override for the default limit on number of results returned,
           which is 200 items.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Server software runs on most flavors of unix, requires dbm
           and perl, and requires about 1.4 GB of data on disk, with
           considerable /tmp space available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">           Server software is available to any site which wants to run
           a server.  Server sites are encouraged to offer the service
           to the net at large.
  Approximate number of such servers in use:  twelve.

  General comments:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Basic veronica service has been fairly stable since July 1993.
   Indexing is quite efficient, and most queries are resolved in ten
   seconds or quicker.  More than 1,000,000 queries were resolved in
   February, 1994.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Though veronica is well-accepted at this level of service, we are
   undertaking significant upgrade efforts during Winter 93-94.

 NIR Tool Name:   WAIS

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   WAIS - The Wide Area Information Servers system - is an electronic
   publishing software set which allows you to search out and retrieve
   multimedia information from databases anywhere in the world.  WAIS
   databases may be accessed by WAIS, gopher, and WWW clients (such as
   Mosaic), and via online services such as Delphi and America OnLine.
   WAIS software includes user interfaces for most platforms, and server
   software that provides automatic indexing of databases.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   WAIS was developed by Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge,
   Massachusetts in collaboration with Apple Computer, Inc., Dow Jones &
   Company, and KPMG Peat Marwick.  With over 100 databases and 5,000
   users worldwide, WAIS is rapidly becoming a standard for information
   distribution within the Internet environment.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   WAIS is a client-server application.  Most of the clients remain
   freely available with a few exceptions.  WAIS, Inc.  develops and
   sells commercial versions of WAIS and the Clearinghouse for Networked
   Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) develops freeWAIS, a
   version free for distribution and use.  A few freely distributable
   versions remain available from Thinking Machines, Inc.  and other
   organizations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   What does WAIS do?

      WAIS allows multimedia information to be stored anywhere on any
      platform.  Using your interface of choice, WAIS enables you to
      find personal, corporate and public information.  The information
      is accessible regardless of format: text, formatted documents,
      pictures, spreadsheets, graphics, sound, or video.
      WAIS recognizes natural language queries. The search and retrieval
      of relevant information is made using your native language.  To
      date, we have used English, French, Italian, and Latin!  The most
      relevant documents, regardless of size, can be sent back to the
      server in their entirety to further refine your search (telling
      the server, "Find me more like this document.") Proven searches
      can be automatically repeated, monitoring and alerting you to new
      information as it becomes available.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   How does WAIS work?

      WAIS uses a single computer-to-computer protocol (NISO Z39.50-
      1988).  Each WAIS server reads your question and based on its
      words, searches the full text of the database for the most
      relevant documents, and ranks them using automatic word weighting.
      Servers need not fully understand your query; the retrieval
      process is based on a search method called relevance feedback.

 NIR Tool Name: Whois

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   As currently defined, NICNAME/WHOIS services is a TCP transaction
   based query/response server, running on a few specific central
   machines, that provides netwide directory service to internet users.
   Since the WHOIS service was defined in 1985, it has evolved into a
   distributed service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The InterNIC Registration Services is located at Network Solutions,
   Inc., Herndon, VA, and is funded by a cooperative agreement from the
   National Science Foundations to provide assistance in registering
   networks, domains, asn's, and other entities to the Internet
   community via telephone, electronic mail, and U.S. postal mail.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Databases and information servers of interest to network users are
   provided, including the WHOIS registry of domains, networks, asn's
   and their associated poc's.  Gopher and Wais interfaces are also
   available for retrieving information and accessing whois.  Online
   documents maintained at registration services include registration
   related rfc's, registration templates, and various netinfo files.
   Many of the online files are available through our automatic mail
   service, MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET.  Whois queries can also be
   directed to rs.internic.net.  From a host, use the TELNET program to
   connect to host RS.INTERNIC.NET.  When greeted by the Registration
   host, type "WHOIS" and press RETURN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET is an automated service provided by InterNIC
   Registration Services.  It allows access to documents and information
   via ordinary electronic mail.  This is especially useful for users
   who do not have access to the NIC via a direct Internet link, such as
   users of BITNET, CSNET and UUCP sites.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To use the mail service, send a mail message to
   MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET.  In the SUBJECT field, request the type of
   service you wish followed by any needed arguments.  The message body
   is normally ignored.  Large files will be broken into smaller
   separate messages.  The information you request will be sent back to
   you as soon as possible.
   WHOIS xxx       Returns information about xxx from the WHOIS service.
                   Use "WHOIS HELP" for information on how to use WHOIS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The MILNET Network Information Center, maintains the central NICNAME
   database and server, providing online look-up of individuals, network
   organizations, MILNET nodes, and other information of interest to
   those involved in management of the Internet.  Whois queries can be
   sent to nic.ddn.mil.

 NIR Tool Name:            World-Wide Web

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The WWW project merges the techniques of networked information and
   hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.  W3
   uses the concept of a seamless information space (the "web"), in
   which all objects including those accessed by earlier protocols
   (wais, gopher, ftp, etc.) exist.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The project allows information sharing within internationally
   dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by support
   groups.  Originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it
   has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in user
   support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas.  It is
   currently the most advanced information system deployed on the
   Internet.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   READER VIEW

      The WWW world consists of documents, and links.  Indexes are
      special documents which, rather than being read, may be searched.
      The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document
      containing links to the documents found.  A simple protocol ("
      HTTP ") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword
      search by a remote information server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The web contains documents in many formats.  Those documents which
      are hypertext, (real or virtual) contain links to other documents,
      or places within documents.  All documents, whether real, virtual
      or indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within
      the same addressing scheme.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a
      number if he or she has no mouse).  To search and index, a reader
      gives keywords (or other search criteria).  These are the only
      operations necessary to access the entire world of data.
   INFORMATION PROVIDER VIEW

      The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via
      existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway.  In this
      way, the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the
      increasing use of the system by readers and information suppliers
      encourage each other.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Providing information is as simple as running the W3 server and
      pointing it at an existing directory structure.  The server
      automatically generates the hypertext view of your files to guide
      the user around.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      To personalize it, you can write a few SGML hypertext files to
      give an even more friendly view.  Also, any file available by
      anonymous FTP, or any internet newsgroup can be immediately linked
      into the web.  The very small start-up effort is designed to allow
      small contributions.  At the other end of the scale, large
      information providers may provide an HTTP server with full text or
      keyword indexing.  This may allow access to a large existing
      database without changing the way that database is managed.  Such
      gateways have already been made into Oracle(tm), WAIS, and
      Digital's VMS/Help systems, to name but a few.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data
      format between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of
      format between a smart browser and a smart server.  This should
      provide a basis for extension into multimedia, and allow those who
      share application standards to make full use of them across the
      web.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities
      opened up by the WWW project, such as efficient document caching.
      The reduction of redundant out-of-date copies, and the use of
      knowledge daemons.  There is more information in the online
      project documentation, including some background on hypertext and
      many technical notes.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   GETTING STARTED

      You can bootstrap yourself into the web by telnetting to
      info.cern.ch (no user or password). You can try a full screen
      interface "Lynx" by telnetting to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu, login in
      as "www".  You can also find out more about WWW in this way.
      These are the least sophisticated browsers -- remember that the
      window-oriented ones are much smarter!  It is much more efficient
      to install a browser on your own machine, and you have many more
      facilities.
      If you have an X-windows based workstation, PC or Mac just FTP to
      FTP.NCSA.UIUC.EDU and get the binary of NCSA's "Mosaic" browser in
      directory /Web/Mosaic-binaries. Download it, uncompress it, set it
      executable, and run it.  It will tell you all you need to know.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Mosaic is now available for PCs and Apple Macs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      If you have an MSDOS machine with Windows, you could try the
      "Cello" browser from FATTY.LAW.CORNELL.EDU in directory
      /pub/LII/Cello.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The line mode browser is currently available in source form by
      anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] if
      you take both files

                /pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_v.vv.tar.Z.
                /pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      (v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)

   Also available is a hypertext editor for the NeXT (in
   /pub/www/bin/next), the MidasWWW and ViolaWWW browsers for X11, an
   alpha-test Mac browser, and and a basic server
   (/pub/www/src/WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).  Documentation, including the
   latest list of software available , is readable using www.  A plain
   text version of the installation instructions is included in the tar
   file!

   Printable (postscript) documentation and articles are in /pub/www/doc
   on info.cern.ch.

 X.500 White Pages

  Date completed or updated: 10 March, 1994
  By: Name:          Chris Weider
      Email address: clw@bunyip.com

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 NIR Tool Name: X.500

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   X.500 is an international standard designed to provide a distributed
   global directory service.  It is primarily used today to provide
   'White Pages' services, although other types of services which have
   directory components (automated mail aliasing, for example) are
   beginning to be run over X.500.  In addition to information about
   people and organizations, the Directory also contains a pilot K-12
   Directory, pilot Information Resource information, and some other
   non-White Pages information.  X.500 contains a number of security
   features, which are implemented on different paradigms in the various
   servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   User's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Users (either human or electronic) run a client program to connect
      to a local X.500 server.  Since X.500 is distributed, it appears
      that the entire global X.500 directory is available from the local
      server.  From this server connection, the user can add, delete, or
      modify information held by the Directory, or issue powerful search
      commands to locate individuals or other information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The first solid version of the X.500 protocol was released in
      1988, and has been the subject of much research in the past 5
      years.  Consequently, there are a large number of clients, for
      almost every platform, and a healthy number of servers.  There are
      mail interfaces to some parts of the X.500 directory, and there is
      a X.500 to Gopher gateway.  An X.500 interface to archie is
      currently under development, as well as an X.500 to WWW interface.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information Provider's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      X.500 provides a set of mechanisms to allow distributed location
      of, maintenance of, and access to a large set of data.  However,
      current servers force a hierarchical view on the location of the
      data, so it may not be suitable for all applications.  Also, the
      X.500 directory is today unable to provide access to information
      at a rate which would allow 'real-time' applications (such as
      keeping routing information in the directory).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Also, there is a great effort underway to reduce the startup costs
      of X.500 access by providing a lightweight X.500 access protocol
      for client-server applications.  This work is detailed in RFC
      1487:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol", by Yeong, Howes, and
      Kille.  This protocol is expected to make the cost of entry for a
      service provider much less that it has been.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Information Types Supported:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      X.500 allows information to be served in an attribute:value
      paradigm, with related attributes grouped into 'objects'. Each
      entry in the directory can be described by multiple objects.
      Attributes can have values which are text strings, dereferenceable
      file names, or text-encoded photographs, and experimentation is
      underway to keep digitally encoded sounds in the directory.

 Description of main group:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Coalition for Networked Information was founded in March 1990 to
   help realize the promise of high performance networks and computers
   for the advancement of scholarship and the enrichment of intellectual
   productivity.  The Coalition is a partnership of the Association of
   Research Libraries (ARL), CAUSE, and EDUCOM.  ARL is dedicated to
   equitable access to, and effective use of, recorded knowlege in
   support of teaching, research, scholarship, and community service,
   and CAUSE and EDUCOM are dedicated to different aspects of the
   introduction, use, and management of information technology and
   related resources in research and education in general and higher
   education in particular.  The Coalition pursues its mission with the
   assistance of a task force that provides a common vehicle by which
   more than 190 institutions and organizations are exploring a shared
   vision of how information management must change in the 1990s to meet
   the social and economic opportunities and challenges of the 21st
   century.  Members of the Coalition Task Force include, among others,
   higher education institutions, publishers, network service providers,
   computer hardware, software, and systems companies, library networks
   and organizations, and public and state libraries. A truly diverse
   collaboration of institutions and organizations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   (from ARL Newsletter #164 -- September 9, 1992)

      The Coalition's TopNode Project is creating a directory of
      directories, catalogs and aids of networked information resources,
      services and tools.  The project is intended to facilitate the
      network navigational duties, responsibilities and tasks of staff
      in libraries, computer centers, networking offices and other
      similar operations.  The primary product of the TopNode project
      will be a set of records describing these networked information
      resources, records that can be loaded into a wide range of
      database management systems.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Based on their response to a Call for Statements of Interest and
      Experience, Indiana University and Merit Network, Inc.  were
      chosen to lead the development effort on the Coalition TopNode
      project.  Pete Percival, Manager, Academic Information Environment
      at Indiana University and Craig Summerhill, Coalition Systems
      Coordinator, have completed the design for the database structure
      which is being built on the Coalition's Internet fileserver using
      BRS/SEARCH.  Based on earlier work of the leaders of the
      Directories and Resource Information Services Working Group,
      George Brett II of the University of North Carolina General
      Administration and Peggy Seiden of Skidmore College Library,
      Percival and Summerhill have developed a data structure that they
      believe to be both flexible and responsive to the needs of the
      many interested parties who have been consulted.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Under the direction of Gary Charbonneau of the Indiana University
      Libraries, records are being created and prepared for loading.  A
      thesaurus of added descriptor terms is being maintained.  As of
      mid-August 1992, close to 200 records had been verified and had
      received descriptive cataloging.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      When the database is complete, libraries will be alerted and
      encouraged to mount the TopNode records into their online
      catalogs.  Records will be available from the Coalition.  In
      addition, MERIT will use the TopNode database in an experiment to
      test the viability of the X.500 directory format standard for
      providing yellow pages-type services (e.g., with subject access).
      After its initial release, the database will be maintained by
      Indiana University libraries on the Coalition server; BRS has
      assisted in the development of procedures for online data entry.

 Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

 Working subgroups:
  Name of subgroup:
  Mailinglist-Address:  ietf-wnils@ucdavis.edu

 Description of main group:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> This description is the current WNILS-WG charter.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Network Information Center (NIC) maintains the central NICNAME
   database and server, defined in RFC 954, providing online look-up of
   individuals, network organizations, key nodes, and other information
   of interest to those who use the Internet.  Other distributed
   directory information servers and information retrieval tools have
   been developed and it is anticipated more will be created.  Many
   sites now maintain local directory servers with information about
   individuals, departments and services at that specific site.
   Typically these directory servers are network accessible.  Because
   these servers are local, there are now wide variations in the type of
   data stored, access methods, search schemes, and user interfaces.
   The purpose of the Whois and Network Information Lookup Service
   (WNILS) working group is to expand and define the standard for WHOIS
   services, to resolve issues associated with the variations in access
   and to promote a consistent and predictable service across the
   network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Goals and Milestones:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Done    Review and approve the charter making any changes deemed
          necessary. Examine the particular functional needs for
          expanded whois directory service. Begin work on a framework
          for recommendations.  Assign writing assignments for first
          draft of document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  12/1/93 Submit the Whois and Network Information Lookup Service
          Recommendations document to the IESG as an Internet Draft.
  12/1/93 Submit the WHOIS++ protocol document to the IESG as an
          Internet Draft.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  12/1/93 Submit the "Architecture of the Whois++ Index Service"
          document to the IESG as a revised Internet Draft.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  12/1/93 Freeze all work on the Internet Drafts for 6 months for
          software development.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Membership is open to attendees of the quarterly IETF meetings; the
  mailing list is open to all.  The WNILS-WG charter can be obtained via
  anonymous ftp from the Document Archive sites listed in the Networked
  Information Retrieval Working Group (WNILS-WG) template.

 NIR Group Name: Internet Research Task Force Research Group on Resource
                 Discovery and Directory Service (IRTF-RD)

 Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Society

 Working subgroups: None

 Description of main group:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The IRTF-RD group is focused on problems of scale that will arise in
  resource discovery systems in the next 3-5 years.  We divide these
  scaling problems into three dimensions: volume of information, size of
  the user base, and information diversity.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Our goal is to explore techniques for dealing with these problems
  through a set of interrelated prototypes demonstrating advances in
  each of these dimensions.  Briefly, our current approaches are:
     - deal with information diversity through a coordinated set
       of techniques to gather, transform, and manage entropy of data
     - deal with user scale through large scale replication
     - deal with information volume using a combination of
       views, space efficient indexing, and customization w.r.t.
       vocabulary, search methods, and personal user history
  We expect these approaches to evolve significantly over time.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Membership of this group is closed.  We will consider new members,
  with two constraints.  First, the group must be kept small and focused
  to make substantive progress - at most 4 or 5 members seems
  appropriate at this time.  Second, prospective members must be active
  resource discovery researchers, who will bring clear strengths to the
  group.  Prospective members should send a vitae and a one page
  position paper describing what they propose to do to advance the
  group's efforts, addressed to the group chair.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The group currently consists of:
     Mic Bowman (Transarc, Inc.)

 Description of main group:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Z39.50 Implementors group (ZIG) is a volunteer organization
   consisting of representatives of most of the organizations in the
   United States and Canada that are actively engaged in implementing
   the Z39.50 protocol.  This includes the United States Library of
   Congress, The National Library of Canada, the major bibliographic
   utilities, many library automation vendors, and other information
   service providers.  The group is a volunteer effort whose meetings
   are open at no charge to all.  The group meets about 3 times a year
   and conducts its activities extensively on its mailing list which is
   also open to any interested party.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The group was originally formed to deal with interoperability issues
   among the Z39.50 implementations that were beginning to emerge in
   1989 and 1990 but the group has since expanded its role and has now
   become the primary forum in which new features and versions of the
   Z39.50 are developed.

 Other Information:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Brief Description of the Z39.50 Protocol

   Z39.50 is a US ANSI standard protocol for information retrieval.  It
   uses a client server model that allows clients ( or origins in Z39.50
   terminology) to search servers (targets in Z39.50 usage) and retrieve
   records from remote databases.  The type and format of the data
   retrieved is not constrained by the protocol but is agreed to by the
   origin and the target.  There is a mechanism that allows popular
   record syntax's to be registered and then referred to by well known
   identifiers.  Z39.50 is an OSI application layer protocol; that is,
   it is designed to make use of the OSI presentation layer protocol.
   It may be used with or without the presentation protocol, and below
   that, it is irrelevant (to the Z39.50 protocol) what protocols are
   used.  Most implementations of Z39.50 currently run directly over
   TCP/IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> User's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Users (either human or electronic) run client software to connect
   with servers to retrieve information using the Z39.50 protocol.  Many
   clients already exist at least in prototype version today and more
   are being written.  Most of the major library automation vendors have
   announced that they will be supporting Z39.50 in either client or
   server mode or both.  Many of the major information vendors either
   currently have or are working on implementations of Z39.50 for their
   systems.  There are also a couple of Z39.50 implementations that are
   expected to be put in the public domain at some point.  The recently
   announced FREEWAIS software incorporates Z39.50 Version 2 into it
   (the older version used a variant of the 1988 version 1 protocol).
   The Library of Congress acts as the maintenance agency for Z39.50 and
   can be contacted for a list of registered Implementors.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Z39.50 provides a protocol mechanism for accessing remote information
   sources.  It defines the model for the interaction between two sides,
   a client and a server.  It makes no assumptions or presumptions about
   how the data is actually organized in the server, nor about how the
   data is presented to the end user by the client.
   The model postulates one or more databases on the remote system that
   can be searched using attributes from defined search attribute sets,
   creating a result set.  Records can be retrieved from the result set
   using agreed upon record formats.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> Information types supported:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Z39.50 protocol was designed as a general purpose search and
   retrieval mechanism that could be used with a wide variety of data
   types.  The MARC format (a format used for cataloging library
   material among other things) and a search attribute set suitable for
   bibliographic and similar types of data are registered within the
   current version of the standard.  It is assumed that, as the protocol
   begins to be used by other communities and for other types of data,
   other attribute sets and record syntaxes will be developed.  This
   process has already begun and a generic record syntax and attribute
   set are already under development, as well as some others,
   specifically those supporting chemical structures, general science
   and technology, and business information.  The design philosophy
   behind Z39.50 is that it will be used with other standards such as
   Postscript, SGML, ODIF (and others), to communicate a wide variety of
   data types, including full text, images, and many others.

  information to the wider community.
  The ISUS Working Group is chartered to have a very broad area of
  interest which is broken down into several sub-areas:
               Network User Support
               Asynchronous Group Communication
               Networked Information Retrieval and Services
               Liaison

  Current tasks being worked on in the area of NIR include:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  o    Coordination of NIR services in Europe

  o    Collection of information related to NIR tools and groups.
       This is a joint effort with the IETF and CNI.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  o    Network Interface to everything (UNITE).  This group is starting
       to look at the user requirements for a single interface to the
       network (network information services, email, bulletin boards,
       etc.).   (unite@mailbase.ac.uk)

  o    Multimedia Information Services task force (MMIS).  This group is
       a joint task force of the RARE ISUS Working Group and RARE
       Interactive Multimedia Working Group (mmis@mailbase.ac.uk).

 Working Group or Organisation:  USMARC/OCLC

 Name of group: USMARC Advisory Group; OCLC Internet Resources
                Cataloging Experiment

 Sponsoring Organisations: OCLC, Library of Congress,
                           USMARC Advisory Group

 Working subgroups:  None

 Description of main group:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  OCLC and the Library of Congress have formed a working group to
  consider how libraries can create cataloging records for online
  information resources.  The group initiated a cataloging experiment
  designed to test and verify the applicability of the cataloging rules
  and the USMARC format for computer files.  Guidelines have been
  written for cataloging Internet resources and were considered by the
  American Library Association committee responsible for maintaining the
  Anglo- American Cataloging Rules.  Changes to the USMARC format were
  initiated to accommodate a subset of these materials (electronic data
  resources, such as software, electronic text, bibliographic and
  nonbibliographic databases).  USMARC format changes which were
  approved included an identification of type of file and a field for
  location and access of the resource (very much like a URL).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The group is continuing its work by looking at how online systems and
  services can be accommodated in USMARC.  This work will be done within
  the USMARC Advisory Group of the American Library Association, which
  considers changes to the USMARC formats.  Data elements will be
  defined with mapping to MARC fields; in some cases new fields will be
  proposed.  This will be accomplished in conjunction with efforts by
  other working groups (e.g., Government Information Locator Service, or
  GILS).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  A proposal was presented and approved in February 1994 to the USMARC
  Advisory Group to add data elements to the Electronic Location and
  Access Field (USMARC field 856).  Included among these was a subfield
  for URL (Uniform Resource Locator).  It is intended to be used instead
  of or in addition to other data identifying location of and access to
  a networked information resource.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Membership is closed at this point.

   The report was very much a collaborative effort of the members of the
   NIR WG and in particular Peter Deutsch (who contributed the mailing
   list section and the basis for Section 5), April Marine, Rick
   Rodgers, Lars-Gunnar Olsson, Farhad Anklesaria, Marsha Perrott, Kevin
   Gamiel, George Brett, Barbara Thomas and all those who helped review
   the document.  Special thanks are due to all those contributors who
   took the time to submit and update descriptions of their NIR tools
   and groups; their names are included in the templates in Sections 6
   and 7.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Before final submission of the report as an RFC, independent
   reviewers from around the world took two or three templates each and
   checked them out for accuracy and currency as best they could.  They
   liaised with the original template authors over the changes they
   made.  The volunteers were: Larry Masinter, Marilyn Martin, Sinha
   Velu, Ton Verschuren, Shirley Browne, Alfred Vella, Bert Stals,
   Yannis Corovesis, Gerard Egan, Robert Janz and Andy Linton.  They
   provided some very valuable input.

 NIR Tool Name: Hyper-G

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Hyper-G is the name of an ambitious hypermedia project currently being
  developed as a joint effort by a number of institutes of the IIG
  (Institutes for Information-Processing Graz) and the Computing and
  Information Services Center of the Graz University of Technology and
  the Austrian Computer Society.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Hyper-G is designed as a general-purpose, large-scale, multi-user,
  distributed hypermedia information system.  As such, it combines
  concepts of hypermedia, information retrieval systems, documentation
  systems with aspects of communication and collaboration, and computer
  supported teaching and learning.  It also provides seamless
  integration of other systems (e.g., World-Wide Web, Gopher, WAIS) that
  also operate under the client/server paradigm and allows remote logins
  to interactive services.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  In addition to hypertext links, Hyper-G allows navigation through
  hierarchies, queries (including full text), guided tours, and is
  multilingual.
  Hyper-G is currently operated at some 10 locations throughout the
  world, including a University Information System at the Graz Technical
  University.  Clients and the server are available without fee for
  educational institutions, and are distributed as binaries for a number
  of platforms.

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  A tool to aid users in the efficient retrieval of documents, s/w, and
  the like from servers ( anonymous FTP, FTAM, ..  ) connected to the
  network.  In principle, it uses the X.500 Directory framework to store
  information about the network.  This includes the network
  configuration, the properties of the links that connect the network
  elements, location of servers and their contents.  When a user looks
  for a particular document or s/w the above information is used to
  search for the object starting from the server that is
  "nearest" (cheapest) to the user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The X.500 directory services is used in several stages

       get attributes for computing cost of paths
       search for file that is being sought

  However, under present circumstances, due to lack of deployment of
  network information in the directory, when information is unavailable
  from X.500, alternate sources/methods are used.  [Static-lists of
  file-servers, or lists of file servers from other clients (e.g.,
  archie); Paths and/or costs are obtained from static lists or derived
  by other direct means (e.g., ping, traceroute); file information is
  sought from other servers (e.g., archie).]

  User's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  A "single window" view of the public archives connected to the
  network.  It locates the server that contains the sought object and is
  near(/cheap/fast) server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Query of files based on incomplete name is supported.  The system also
  supports queries based on keywords.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Information Provider's View:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The information about the server contents have to be updated
  at a single place- namely, the local Directory Service Agent.
  The Directory Service Agent makes the information globally
  accessible.
  It is not necessary to carry out periodic updates on one or
  more information servers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  - information types supported (e.g., text, sound, etc.)

  Since the system supports query on name and keywords (not on
  contents) all kinds of information may be supported.

 NIR Tool Name: whois++ and the whois++ index service

 Brief Description of Tool:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  whois++ and the whois++ index service are extensions of the WHOIS
  protocol.  They are designed to a) subsume in a standardized fashion
  the many enhancements which have been added to individual WHOIS
  servers; b) extend the flexibility of WHOIS by enriching the query
  syntax, and c) provide a distributed indexing system to tie the
  various whois++ servers into a distributed information lookup service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The protocols describe two logically distinct types of servers that an
  information provider can set up.  The first type is the base-level
  whois++ server.  This contains primary information, such as entries
  for individual people or entries describing resources available
  locally.  For example, if one wished to provide a campus directory
  through whois++, one would set up a base-level whois++ server that
  contained entries for each student.  In addition, this base-level
  server must be able to generate 'forward knowledge' for the
  information it contains.  The second type of server collects the
  'forward knowledge' generated by a number of base-level servers, and
  can take a query sent to it and determine which of the base-level
  servers it indexes might contain information relevant for the query.
  A single physical server may contain both primary information and
  'forward knowledge' for a number of other servers, and an index server
  can also index 'forward knowledge' for a number of other index
  servers, allowing a hierarchical mesh of index servers to be built.
  For more details on the information provider's point of view, see the
  'Documentation' section of this template.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  The basic information model is centered on the concept of 'templates'.
  A template is a collection of attribute:value pairs, where the
  allowable attributes are specified by the template type.  The whois++
  templates are based on the templates defined by the IAFA working group
  of the IETF.  The values associated with given attributes are not
  necessarily limited to text, they can be digitized sound clips, etc.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">  Depending on the client she uses, the user will see a connection to
  the local whois++ base-level server.  The user can ask the server for
  a list of templates supported by that server, and can then call up a
  blank version of the template so that she can fill in values for the
  attributes she knows.  Once she has filled in the template as much as
  she wants, she issues a query to the server to find all the entries
  which have these attribute:value pairs.  If she is not satisfied with
  the responses, she can then start traversing the index service to
  locate a server which can adequately answer her query.  In addition,
  if a user makes frequent use of the index service, she can set
  'bookmarks' which can be used later to directly contact servers she's
  found useful in the past, without having to traverse the index service
  again.
