	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   The first version of BCP 101, i.e., RFC 4071 [1], assumed that the
   vehicle for certain IETF-related Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
   would be the Internet Society (ISOC).  Since that time, an IETF Trust
   has been created to hold such IPR.  This document appropriately
   updates RFC 4071.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This update comes into force as soon as it has been approved by the
   IESG and the IETF Trust Agreement [2] has been formally signed by its
   Settlors and initial Trustees.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Terms and abbreviations used in this document are defined in RFC
   4071.
	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Updates to RFC 4071</h2></a>

   A Trust ("the IETF Trust") has been formed for the purpose of
   acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing and
   future intellectual property and other property used in connection
   with the administration of the IETF.  The Trust was formed by the
   signatures of its Settlors and initial Trustees.  The Settlors, who
   contributed initial intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and
   the Corporation for National Research Initiatives.  The Trustees of
   the IETF Trust are the members of the IAOC, and the Beneficiary of
   the IETF Trust is the IETF as a whole.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In its administration of IPR under the terms of BCP 101, the IASA,
   including the IAD and the IAOC, will treat the IETF Trust rather than
   ISOC as the proper entity for ownership and licensing of IETF IPR.
   Specifically, references to ISOC in sections 3.1, 5.3, and 7 of [1]
   shall be interpreted as referring to the IETF Trust wherever IPR
   issues are concerned.  The duty to serve as Trustees is added to
   section 3.2 of [1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document has no security implications for the Internet.
