Request for Comments: 43                      M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory
                                              8 April 1970


                         Proposed Meeting


      On Friday, 8 May 1970, at 9:30 AM a meeting at M.I.T. Lincoln
Laboratory is proposed. A description of LIL (Local Interaction
Language) for the TSP (Terminal Support Processor) system will be
presented.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The purpose of the TSP system is to provide a flexible I/O
capability for network users. In order to achieve maximum flexibility,
the system is user-programmable in an interpretable language called
LIL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      LIL has the appropriate primitives for manipulating tree
structures (for interactive graphics) as well as message-oriented
I/O. The general purpose portion of the language is used to specify
the I/O handlers and the display structures.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      A discussion of the problems of handling interactive programs
over the ARPA network will follow.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      This conference is intended as a working group and each host
should send as few or as many individuals as are actively
interested. A working document on LIL will be mailed about a week in
advance to interested individuals.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Anyone interested in attending and/or receiving the documents
should contact A. G. Nemeth (x7354) or J. Forgie (x7173) at
M.I.T. Lincoln Labs, Lexington, Mass. 02173, (617) 862-5500.<br>
