   This document specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to ANSI
   High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) hardware addresses and
   for emulating IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct
   extension of HARP. This memo defines a HARP that will interoperate
   between HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 (also known as Gigabyte System
   Network, GSN). This document (when combined with RFC-2067 "IP over
   HIPPI") obsoletes RFC-1374.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.  Introduction</h2></a>

   The ANSI High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) is a dual
   simplex data channel.   HIPPI can send and receive data
   simultaneously at 800 or 1600 megabits per second. Between 1987 and
   1997, the ANSI X3T11.1 HIPPI working group (now known as NCITS T11.1)
   Standardized five documents that bear on the use of HIPPI as a
   network interface.  They cover the physical and electrical
   specification (HIPPI-PH [1]), the framing of a stream of bytes
   (HIPPI-FP [2]), encapsulation of IEEE 802.2 LLC (HIPPI-LE [3]), the
   behavior of a physical layer switch (HIPPI-SC [4]) and the physical-
   level and optical specification (HIPPI-Serial [5]).  HIPPI-LE also
   implies the encapsulation of Internet Protocol[5].  The reader should
   be familiar with the ANSI HIPPI documents. Approved ANSI NCITS
   standards are available from ANSI (http://www.ansi.org). The working
   documents of the T11.1 working group may be obtained from the T11 web
   page (http://www.t11.org/).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HIPPI switches can be used to connect a variety of computers and
   peripheral equipment for many purposes, but the working group stopped
   short of describing their use as Local Area Networks.  RFC-2067 [15]
   describes the encapsulation of IP over HIPPI-800. This memo takes up
   where the working group and RFC-2067 [15] left off and defines
   address resolution and LIS IP broadcast emulation for HIPPI-800
   networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   While investigating possible solutions for HARP it became evident
   that IP broadcast could easily be emulated for both HIPPI-800 and
   HIPPI-6400 hardware types. This is useful since HIPPI switches are
   not required to implement broadcast but many standard networking
   protocols rely on broadcast.  This memo therefore further addresses
   the emulation of LIS IP broadcast as an extension of HARP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.  Terminology</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [18].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  Definitions</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  Global concepts used</h3></a>

   In the following discussion, the terms "requester" and "target" are
   used to identify the port initiating the address resolution request
   and the port whose address it wishes to discover, respectively.  If
   not all switches in the LIS support broadcast then there will be a
   HARP server providing the address resolution service and it will be
   the source of the reply. If on the other hand all switches support
   broadcast then the source address of a reply will be the target's
   target address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Values are decimal unless otherwise noted. Formatting follows IEEE
   802.1A canonical bit order and and HIPPI-FP bit and byte order.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Glossary</h3></a>

   Broadcast

   A distribution mode which transmits a message to all ports.
   Particularly also the port sending the message.
   Classical/Conventional

   Both terms are used to refer to networks such as Ethernet, FDDI, and
   other 802 LAN types, as distinct from HIPPI-SC LANs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Destination

   The HIPPI port that receives data from a HIPPI Source.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HARP

   HARP describes the whole set of HIPPI address resolution encodings
   and algorithms defined in this memo. HARP is a combination and
   adaptation of the Internet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) RFC-826
   [13] and Inverse ARP (InARP) [7] (see section 5). HARP also describes
   the HIPPI specific version of ARP [10] (i.e. the protocol and the
   HIPPI specific encoding).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HARP table

   Each host has a HARP table which contains the IP to hardware address
   mapping of IP members.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HIPPI-Serial

   An implementation of HIPPI in serial fashion on coaxial cable or
   optical fiber. (see [5])

   HRAL

   The HARP Request Address List.  A list of ULAs to which HARP messages
   are sent when resolving names to addresses (see section 4.2).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Hardware (HW) address

   The hardware address of a port consisting of an I-Field and an
   optional ULA (see section 6.2). Note: the term port as used in this
   document refers to a HIPPI port and is roughly equivalent to the term
   "interface" as commonly used in other IP documents.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Host

   An entity, usually a computer system, that may have one or more HIPPI
   ports and which may serve as a client or a HARP server.
   Port

   An entity consisting of one HIPPI Source/Destination dual simplex
   pair that is connected by parallel or serial HIPPI to a HIPPI-SC
   switch and that transmits and receives IP datagrams.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   PIBES

   The Protocol for Internet Broadcast Emulation Server (see section 7).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Switch Address

   A value used as the address of a port on a HIPPI-SC network.  It is
   transmitted in the I-field.  HIPPI-SC switches map Switch Addresses
   to physical switch port numbers. The switch address is extended with
   a mode byte to form an I-Field (see [4] and 6.2.2)

   Source

   The HIPPI port that generates data to send to a HIPPI Destination.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Universal LAN MAC Address (ULA)

   A 48-bit globally unique address, administered by the IEEE, assigned
   to each port on an Ethernet, FDDI, 802 network, or HIPPI-SC LAN.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IP Subnetwork Configuration</h2></a>

	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1  Background</h3></a>

   ARP (address resolution protocol) as defined in [12] was meant to
   work on the 'local' cable. This definition gives the ARP protocol a
   local logical IP subnet (LIS) scope. In the LIS scenario, each
   separate administrative entity configures its hosts and routers
   within the LIS. Each LIS operates and communicates independently of
   other LIS's on the same HIPPI network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HARP has LIS scope only and serves all ports in the LIS.
   Communication to ports located outside of the local LIS is usually
   provided via an IP router. This router is a HIPPI port attached to
   the HIPPI network that is configured as a member of one or more
   LIS's. This configuration MAY result in a number of disjoint LIS's
   operating over the same HIPPI network. Using this model, ports of
   different IP subnets SHOULD communicate via an intermediate IP router
   even though it may be possible to open a direct HIPPI connection
   between the two IP members over the HIPPI network. This is a
   consequence of using IP and choosing to have multiple LIS's on the
   same HIPPI fabric.
   By default, the HARP method detailed in section 5 and the classical
   LIS routing model MUST be available to any IP member client in the
   LIS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2  HIPPI LIS Requirements</h3></a>

   The requirement for IP members (hosts, routers) operating in a HIPPI
   LIS configuration is:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  All members of the LIS SHALL have the same IP network/subnet
      address and address mask [6].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The following list identifies the set of HIPPI-specific parameters
   that MUST be implemented in each IP station connected to the HIPPI
   network:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  HIPPI Hardware Address:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The HIPPI hardware address of an individual IP port MUST contain
      the port's Switch Address (see section 9). The address SHOULD also
      contain a non-zero ULA address. If there is no ULA then that field
      MUST be zero.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  HARP Request Address List (HRAL):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The HRAL is an ordered list of two or more addresses identifying
      the address resolution service(s). All HARP clients MUST be
      configured identically, i.e. all ports MUST have the same
      addresses(es) in the HRAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The HRAL MUST contain at least two HIPPI HW addresses identifying
      the individual HARP service(s) that have authoritative
      responsibility for resolving HARP requests of all IP members
      located within the LIS.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      By default the first address MUST be the reserved address for
      broadcast, i.e. the address for "IP traffic conventionally
      directed to the IEEE 802.1 broadcast address: 0xFE1" [4]. The ULA
      for this HARP service entry SHALL be FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      It is REQUIRED that the second address be the address for
      "Messages pertaining to (the) ... address  resolution requests:
      0xFE0" [4]. The ULA for this HARP server entry is
      00:00:00:00:00:00.
Therefore, the HRAL entries are sorted in the following order:
  1st **  : broadcast address            (0x07000FE1 FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF),
  2nd **  : official HARP server address (0x07000FE0 00:00:00:00:00:00),
  3rd & on: any additional HARP server addresses will be sorted in
            decreasing order of the 12bit destination switch
            address portion of their I-Field (see section 6.2).
  ** REQUIRED

   Within the restrictions mentioned above and in Section 6.2.2, local
   administration choose address(es) for the additional HARP services
   which they will put into the HRAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   An example of such a list:
      1st entry: 0x07000FE1 FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
      2nd entry: 0x07000FE0 00:00:00:00:00:00
      3rd entry: 0x07000001 <Alternate-HARP-server-ula>
      ...

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Manual configuration of the addresses and address lists presented in
   this section is implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this
   memo.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5"><h2>5.  HIPPI Address Resolution Protocol - HARP</h2></a>

   Address resolution within the HIPPI LIS SHALL make use of the HIPPI
   Address Resolution Protocol (HARP) and the Inverse HIPPI Address
   Resolution Protocol (InHARP). HARP provides the same functionality as
   the Internet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). HARP is based on ARP
   which is defined in RFC-826 [13]. Knowing the Internet address,
   conventional networks use ARP to discover another port's hardware
   address. HARP presented in this section further specifies the
   combination of the original protocol definitions to form a coherent
   address resolution service that is independent of the hardware's
   broadcast capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   InHARP is based on the original Inverse ARP (InARP) protocol
   presented in [7].  Knowing its hardware address, InARP is used to
   discover the other party's Internet address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo further REQUIRES the PIBES (see section 7 below) extension
   to the HARP protocol, guaranteeing broadcast service to upper layer
   protocols like IP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Internet addresses are assigned independent of ULAs and switch
   addresses.  Before using HARP, each port MUST know its IP and its
   hardware addresses. The ULA is optional but is RECOMMENDED if
   bridging to conventional networks is desired.
	<a name="section-5.1"><h3>5.1  HARP Algorithm</h3></a>

   This section defines the behavior and requirements for HARP
   implementations on both broadcast and non-broadcast capable HIPPI-SC
   networks. HARP creates a table in each port which maps the IP address
   of each port to a hardware address, so that when an application
   requests a connection to a remote port by its IP address, the
   hardware address can be determined, a correct HIPPI-LE header can be
   built, and a connection to the port can be established using the
   correct Switch Address in the I-field.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HARP is a two phase protocol. The first phase is the registration
   phase and the second phase is the operational phase. In the
   registration phase the port detects if it is connected to broadcast
   hardware or not.  The InHARP protocol is used in the registration
   phase.  In case of non-broadcast capable hardware, the InHARP
   Protocol will register and establish a table entry with the server.
   The operational phase works much like conventional ARP with the
   exception of the message format.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.1"><h4>5.1.1  Selecting the authoritative HARP service</h4></a>

   Within the HIPPI LIS, there SHALL be an authoritative HARP service.
   At each point in time there is only one authoritative HARP service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   To select the authoritative HARP service, each port needs to
   determine if it is connected to a broadcast network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The port SHALL send an InHARP_REQUEST to the first address in its
   HRAL (0x07000FE1 FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF). If the port sees its own
   InHARP_REQUEST, then it is connected to a broadcast capable network.
   In this case, the rest of the HRAL is ignored and the authoritative
   HARP service is the broadcast entry.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the port is connected to a non-broadcast capable network, then the
   port SHALL send the InHARP_REQUEST to all of the remaining entries in
   the HRAL. Every address which sends an InHARP_REPLY is considered to
   be a responsive HARP server. The authoritative HARP service SHALL be
   the HARP server which appears first in the HRAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The sequence of the HRAL is only important for deciding which address
   will be the authoritative one. On a non-broadcast network, the port
   is REQUIRED to keep "registered" with all HARP server addresses in
   the HRAL (NOTE: not the broadcast address since it is not a HARP
   server address). If for instance the authoritative HARP service is
   non-responsive,  then the port will consider the next address in the
   HRAL as a candidate for the authoritative address and send an
   InHARP_REQUEST.
   The authoritative HARP server SHOULD be considered non-responsive
   when it has failed to reply to: (1) one or more registration requests<br>
   by the client (see section 5.1.2 and 5.2), (2) any two HARP_REQUESTs<br>
   in the last 120 seconds or (3) if an external agent has detected<br>
   failure of the authoritative HARP server. The details of such an
   external agent and its interaction with the HARP client are beyond
   the scope of this document. Should an authoritative HARP server
   become non-responsive, then the registration process SHOULD be
   restarted. Alternative methods for choosing an authoritative HARP
   service are not prohibited.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.1.2"><h4>5.1.2  HARP registration phase</h4></a>

   HARP clients SHALL initiate the registration phase by sending an
   InHARP_REQUEST message using the addresses in the HRAL in order. The
   client SHALL terminate the registration phase and transition into the
   operational phase, either when it receives its own InHARP_REQUEST or
   when it receives an InHARP_REPLY from at least one of the HARP
   servers and when it has determined the authoritative HARP service as
   described in section 5.1.1.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   When ports are initiated they send an InHARP_REQUEST to the
   authoritative address as described in section 5.1.2. The first
   address to be tried will be the broadcast address "0x07000FE1
   FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF". There are two outcomes:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. The port sees its own InHARP_REQUEST: then the port is connected
      to a broadcast capable network. The first address becomes and
      remains the authoritative address for the HARP service.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. The port does not receive its InHARP_REQUEST: then the port is
      connected to a non-broadcast capable network.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In the second case, the port SHALL choose the next address in the
   HRAL as a candidate for a authoritative address and send an
   InHARP_REQUEST to that address: (0x07000FE0 00:00:00:00:00:00).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the port receives its own message, then the port itself is the
      HARP server and the port is REQUIRED to provide broadcast services
      using the PIBES (see section 7).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  If the port receives an InHARP_REPLY, then it is a HARP client and
      not a HARP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In both cases, the current candidate address becomes the
   authoritative HARP service address.
   If the client determines it is connected to a non-broadcast capable
   network then the client SHALL continue to retry each non-broadcast
   HARP server address in the HRAL at least once every 5 seconds until
   one of these two termination criteria are met for each address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   InHARP is an application of the InARP protocol for a purpose not
   originally intended.  The purpose is to accomplish registration of
   port IP address mappings with a HARP server if one exists or detect
   hardware broadcast capability.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the HIPPI-SC LAN supports broadcast, then the client will see its
   own InHARP_REQUEST message and SHALL complete the registration phase.
   The client SHOULD further note that it is connected to a broadcast

   The HARP client is responsible for contacting the HARP server(s) to
   have its own HARP information registered and to gain and refresh its
   own HARP entry/information about other IP members. This means, as
   noted above, that HARP clients MUST be configured with the hardware
   address of the HARP server(s) in the HRAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   HARP clients MUST:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   1. When an interface is enabled (e.g. "ifconfig <interface> up" with
      an IP address) or assigned the first or an additional IP address
      (i.e. an IP alias), the client SHALL initiate the registration
      phase.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   2. In the operational phase the client MUST respond to HARP_REQUEST
      and InHARP_REQUEST messages if it is the target port.  If an
      interface has multiple IP addresses (e.g., IP aliases) then the
      client MUST cycle through all the IP addresses and generate an
      InHARP_REPLY for each such address. In that case an InHARP_REQUEST
      will have multiple replies. (Refer to Section 7, "Protocol
      Operation" in RFC-1293  [7].)

   3. React to address resolution reply messages appropriately to build
      or refresh its own client HARP table entries. All solicited and
      unsolicited HARP_REPLYs from the authoritative HARP server SHALL
      be used to update and refresh its own client HARP table entries.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      Explanation: This allows the HARP server to update the clients
      when one of server's mappings change, similar to what is
      accomplished on Ethernet with gratuitous ARP.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   4. Generate and transmit InHARP_REQUEST messages as needed  and

      build or refresh its HARP table entries.  (Refer to Section 7,
      "Protocol Operation" in [7].)
   If the registration phase showed that the hardware does not support
   broadcast, then the client MUST refresh its own entry for the HARP
   server, created during the registration phase, at least once every 15
   minutes. This can be accomplished either through the exchange of a
   HARP request/reply with the HARP server or by repeating step 1. To
   decrease the redundant network traffic, this timeout SHOULD be reset
   after each HARP_REQUEST/HARP_REPLY exchange.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Explanation: The HARP_REQUEST shows the HARP server that the client
   is still alive. Receiving a HARP_REPLY indicates to the client that
   the server must have seen the HARP_REQUEST.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If the registration phase shows that the underlying network supports
   broadcast, then periodic InHARP_REQUEST/InHARP_REPLY operations of
   step 4 are NOT REQUIRED.

   If a HARP client receives a HARP message with an operation code

   to return any message to the sender of the undefined message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-5.4"><h3>5.4  HARP Server Operational Requirements</h3></a>

   A HARP server MUST accept HIPPI connections from other HIPPI ports.

	<a name="section-7"><h2>7.   Broadcast and Multicast</h2></a>

   HIPPI-SC does not require switches to support broadcast. Broadcast
   support has therefore been absent from many HIPPI networks.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   During its registration phase, every port, including HARP server(s),
   discover if the underlying medium is capable of broadcast (see
   section 5.1.2). Should this not be the case, then the HARP server(s)
   MUST emulate broadcast through an IP broadcast emulation server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   A HIPPI IP broadcast server (PIBES) is an extension to the HARP
   server and only makes sense when the LIS does not inherently support
   broadcast. The PIBES allows common upper layer networking protocols
   (RIP, TCP, UDP, etc.) to access IP LIS broadcast.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.1"><h3>7.1  Protocol for an IP Broadcast Emulation Server - PIBES</h3></a>

   To emulate broadcast within an LIS, a PIBES SHALL use the currently
   valid HARP table of the HARP server as a list of addresses called the
   target list. The broadcast server SHALL validate that all incoming
   messages have a source address which corresponds to an address in the
   target list. Only messages addressed to the IP LIS broadcast
   addresses, multicast address or 255.255.255.255 are considered valid
   messages for broadcasting. Invalid messages MUST be dropped.  All
   valid incoming messages shall be forwarded to all addresses in the
   target list.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the broadcast server run on the same port as
   the HARP server since this memo does not define the protocol for
   exchanging the valid HARP table. The default address to use for the
   broadcast address is the operational HARP server address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.2"><h3>7.2  IP Broadcast Address</h3></a>

   This memo only defines IP broadcast. It is independent of the
   underlying hardware addressing and broadcast capabilities. Any port
   can differentiate between IP traffic directed to itself and a
   broadcast message sent to it by looking at the IP address. All IP
   broadcast messages SHALL use the IP LIS broadcast address or.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is RECOMMENDED that the PIBES run on the same port as the HARP
   server. In that case, the PIBES SHALL use the same address as the
   HARP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.3"><h3>7.3  IP Multicast Address</h3></a>

   HIPPI does not directly support multicast address, therefore there
   are no mappings available from IP multicast addresses to HIPPI
   multicast services.  Current IP multicast implementations (i.e. MBONE
   and IP tunneling, see [9]) will continue to operate over HIPPI-based
   logical IP subnets if all IP multicast packets are sent using the
   same algorithm as if the packet were being sent to 255.255.255.255.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-7.4"><h3>7.4  A Note on Broadcast Emulation Performance</h3></a>

   It is obvious that a broadcast emulation service (as defined in
   section 7.1) has an inherent performance limit. In an LIS with n
   ports, the upper bound on the bandwidth that such a service can
   broadcast is:
                          (total bandwidth)/(n+1)

   since each message must first enter the broadcast server, accounting
   for the additional 1, and then be sent to all n ports. The broadcast
   server could forward the message destined to the port on which it
   runs internally, thus reducing (n+1) to (n) in a first optimization.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This service is adequate for the standard networking protocols such
   as RIP, OSPF, NIS, etc. since they usually use a small fraction of
   the network bandwidth for broadcast. For these purposes, the
   broadcast emulation server as defined in this memo allows the HIPPI
   network to look similar to an Ethernet network to the higher layers.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   It is further obvious that such an emulation cannot be used to
   broadcast high bandwidth traffic. For such a solution, hardware
   support for true broadcast is required.
	<a name="section-8"><h2>8.  HARP for Scheduled Transfer Protocol[17]</h2></a>

   This RFC also applies for resolving addresses used with Scheduled
   Transfer (STP) over  HIPPI-800 instead of IP. This RFC's message
   types and algorithms can  be used for STP (since STP uses Internet
   Addresses) as long as there is also an IP over HIPPI implementation
   on all of the ports.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-9"><h2>9.  Discovery of One's Own Switch Address</h2></a>

   This HARP specification assumes that each port has prior knowledge of
   its own hardware address.  This address may be manually configured,
   by means outside the scope of this memo or a port may discover its
   own logical address through the algorithm described below.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Ports are NOT REQUIRED to implement this switch address discovery
   protocol but are encouraged to do so since it reduces the
   administrative overhead.  The algorithm presented in this section is
   based on John Renwick's work as detailed in RFC-1374 [14]. The
   concept of the discovery process is to scan all possible switch
   addresses. The messages that are received will be the ones containing
   one of our switch addresses.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   If a port implements this algorithm it SHALL form a HIPPI-LE message
   as defined in HIPPI-LE: containing an Self_Address_Resolution_Request
   (see [3]) PDU Type, a Source_IEEE_Address and
   Destination_IEEE_Address (set to the correct ULA for the sender), and
   the Source_Switch_Address and Destination_Switch_Address.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This self address resolution message uses the same HIPPI-LE message
   format as described in HIPPI-SC and HIPPI-LE: the Self Address
   Resolution Request PDU and Self Address Resolution Response PDU type
   codes and no piggybacked ULP data.  The HIPPI-LE header contents for
   the request are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HIPPI-LE Message_Type is            = 3, Self Addr. Resolution Request
      HIPPI-LE Destination_Address_Type   = 0 (undefined)

      HIPPI-LE Source_Address_Type        = 0 (undefined)
      HIPPI-LE Source_Switch_Address      = 0 (unknown)
      HIPPI-LE Destination_IEEE_Address   = 0
      HIPPI-LE Source_IEEE_Address        = my ULA

   There is no D2 data; the message contains only the HIPPI-FP header
   and D1_Area with the HIPPI-LE header.
   Ports SHALL start the scan with a configurable logical address
   (default 0x000) and increment the value for by one for each
   subsequent try. The port SHALL continue until it sees its own self
   address resolution request or it has reached the end, which may be
   another configurable value (default 0xFFF). It is RECOMMENDED that
   the range of addresses to scan be configurable since some networks
   have equipment that does not gracefully handle HIPPI-LE messages.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   After a port sends the[se] request[s], two positive outcomes are
   possible:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  the port receives its own request(s), and obtains one of its own
      Switch Address, or

   o  the port receives an AR_S_Response with the

   Assume a HIPPI-SC switch is installed with three connected ports: x,
   y, and a.  Each port has a unique hardware address that consists of
   Switch Address (e.g. SWx, SWy, SWa) and unique ULA (ULAx, ULAy and
   ULAa, respectively). There is a HARP server connected to a switch
   port that is mapped to the address HWa (SWa, ULAa), this address is
   the authoritative HIPPI hardware address in the HRAL (HARP Request
   Address List).
   The HARP server's table is empty. Ports X and Y each know their own
   hardware address.  Eventually they want to talk to each other; each
   knows the other's IP address (from the port database) but neither
   knows the other's ULA or Switch Address. Both ports X and Y have
   their interfaces configured DOWN.

      copy of its InHARP_REQUEST. Client Y examines the source
      addresses.  Since they are the same as what Y filled in the
      InHARP_REQUEST, Y can deduce that it is connected to a broadcast
      medium.  Port Y completes its table entry for HWa. This entry will
      not timeout since it is considered unlikely for a particular
      underlying hardware type to change between broadcast and non-
      broadcast; therefore this mapping will never change.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-12.3"><h3>12.3  Operational Phase (phase II)</h3></a>

   The Operational Phase of the HARP protocol as specified in this memo
   is the same for both broadcast and non-broadcast capable HIPPI
   hardware. The authoritative address in the HRAL for this example will
   be HWa: <SWa, ULAa> and IPs for simplicity reasons.
	<a name="section-12.3.1"><h4>12.3.1   Standard successful HARP_Resolve example</h4></a>

   Assume the same process (steps 1-3 of section 10.1) happened for port
   X. Then the state of X and Y's tables is: the HARP server table entry
   is in the VALID state. So lets look at the message traffic when X
   tries to send a message to Y. Since X doesn't have an entry for Y,

   1. Port X connects to the authoritative address of the HRAL and sends
      a HARP_REQUEST for Y's hardware address:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HIPPI-LE Destination_Switch_Address = SWa
      HIPPI-LE Source_Switch_Address      = SWx
      HIPPI-LE Destination_IEEE_Address   = ULAa
      HIPPI-LE Source_IEEE_Address        = ULAx
      HARP ar$op                          = 1  (HARP_REQUEST)
      HARP ar$rpa                         = IPx
      HARP ar$tpa                         = IPy
      HARP ar$rha                         = SWx ULAx
      HARP ar$tha                         = 0 **
      ** is what we would like to find out

   2. The HARP server receives the HARP request and updates its entry
      for X if necessary. It then generates a HARP_REPLY with Y's
      hardware address information.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HIPPI-LE Destination_Switch_Address = SWx
      HIPPI-LE Source_Switch_Address      = SWa
      HIPPI-LE Destination_IEEE_Address   = ULAx
      HIPPI-LE Source_IEEE_Address        = ULAa
      HARP ar$op                          = 2  (HARP_Reply)
      HARP ar$rpa                         = IPy
      HARP ar$tpa                         = IPx
      HARP ar$rha                         = SWy ULAy *
      HARP ar$tha                         = SWx ULAx
      * answer we were looking for

   3. Port X connects to port Y and transmits an IP message with the
      following information in the HIPPI-LE header:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HIPPI-LE Destination_Switch_Address = SWy
      HIPPI-LE Source_Switch_Address      = SWx
      HIPPI-LE Destination_IEEE_Address   = ULAy
      HIPPI-LE Source_IEEE_Address        = ULAx

   If there had been a broadcast capable HIPPI network, the target ports
   would themselves have received the HARP_REQUEST of step 2 above and
   responded to them in the same way the HARP server did.
	<a name="section-12.3.2"><h4>12.3.2  Standard non-successful HARP_Resolve example</h4></a>

   Like in 12.3.1, assume that X and Y are fully registered with the
   HARP server. Then the state of X and Y's HARP server table entry is:
   VALID. So lets look at the message traffic when X tries to send a
   message to Q. Further assume that interface Q is NOT configured UP,
   i.e. it is DOWN.  Since X doesn't have an entry for Q,

   1. Port X connects to the HARP server switch address and sends a
      HARP_REQUEST for Q's hardware address:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HIPPI-LE Destination_Switch_Address = SWa
      HIPPI-LE Source_Switch_Address      = SWx
      HIPPI-LE Destination_IEEE_Address   = ULAa
      HIPPI-LE Source_IEEE_Address        = ULAx
      HARP ar$op                          = 1  (HARP_REQUEST)
      HARP ar$rpa                         = IPx
      HARP ar$tpa                         = IPq
      HARP ar$rha                         = SWx ULAx
      HARP ar$tha                         = 0 **
      ** is what we would like to find out

   2. The HARP server receives the HARP request and updates its entry
      for X if necessary. It then looks up IPq in its tables and doesn't
      find it. The HARP server then generates a HARP_NAK reply message.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      HIPPI-LE Destination_Switch_Address = SWx
      HIPPI-LE Source_Switch_Address      = SWa
      HIPPI-LE Destination_IEEE_Address   = ULAx
      HIPPI-LE Source_IEEE_Address        = ULAa
      HARP ar$op                          = 10  (HARP_NAK)
      HARP ar$rpa                         = IPx
      HARP ar$tpa                         = IPq
      HARP ar$rha                         = SWx ULAx
      HARP ar$tha                         = 0 ***
      *** No Answer, and notice that the fields do not get swapped,
          i.e. the HARP message is the same as the HARP_REQUEST
          except for the operation code.

   This memo could not have come into being without the critical review
   from Greg Chesson, Carlin Otto, the high performance interconnect
   group of Silicon Graphics (specifically Jim Pinkerton, Brad Strand
   and Jeff Young) and the expertise of the ANSI T11.1 Task Group
   responsible for the HIPPI standards work.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This memo is based on the second part of [14], written by John
   Renwick. ARP [13] written by Dave Plummer and Inverse ARP [7] written
   by T. Bradley and C. Brown provide the fundamental algorithms of HARP
   as presented in this memo. Further, the HARP server is based on
   concepts and models presented in [12], written by Mark Laubach who
   laid the structural groundwork for the HARP server.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-15"><h2>15.  Changes from RFC-1374 [14]</h2></a>

   RFC-2067 obsoletes RFC-1374 but left ARP outside of its scope because
   there was not enough implementation experience. This memo is an
   effort to clarify and expand the definition of ARP over HIPPI as
   found in RFC-1374 such that implementations will be more readily
   possible, especially considering forward interoperability with
   HIPPI-6400.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The changes from RFC-1374 [14] are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  A new message format to acknowledge the HIPPI hardware address
      format and to eliminate the requirement of HIPPI-LE ARP for HARP
      to function.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Explicit registration phase.
   o  Additional message formats: InHARP requests and replies as well as
      HARP_NAKs.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Details about the IP subnetwork configuration.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  Details about table aging.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   o  IP broadcast emulation.
