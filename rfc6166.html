                    A Registry for PIM Message Types

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document provides instructions to IANA for the creation of a
   registry for PIM message types.  It specifies the initial content of
   the registry, based on existing RFCs specifying PIM message types.
   It also specifies a procedure for registering new types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to this, one message type is reserved, and may be used
   for a future extension of the message type space.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   Apart from this document, there is no existing document specifying a
   registry for PIM message types.  PIM version 1 made use of IGMP
   [RFC1112], and there is an IGMP registry [IGMPREG] listing the
   message types used by PIM version 1.  PIM version 2, however, is not
   based on IGMP, and a separate PIM message type registry is needed.
   There are currently several RFCs specifying new PIM version 2 message
   types that should be in this new registry.  They are the RFCs for PIM
   Dense Mode [RFC3973], PIM Sparse Mode [RFC4601], and Bidirectional
   PIM [RFC5015].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   This document specifies the initial content of the new PIM message
   type registry, based on those existing RFCs.  This document also
   specifies a procedure for registering new PIM message types.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   In addition to this, this document reserves one message type.  This
   type may be used for a future extension of the message type space.
   The current message type space is only 4 bits, so it is not unlikely
   that this will be needed.  How exactly the extension should be done
   is left to a future document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   This document only creates an IANA registry.  There may be a security
   benefit in a well-known place for finding information on which PIM
   message types are valid and how they are used.  Apart from that,
   there are no security considerations.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA has created a PIM message type registry.  It has been placed in
   the "Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)" branch of the tree.  Each
   entry in the registry consists of a message type, a message name, and
   references to the documents defining the type.  The message type is a
   4-bit integer with possible values from 0 to 15.
	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Initial Registry</h3></a>

   The initial content of the registry should be as follows.

   Assignment of new message types is done according to the "IETF

   Thanks to Toerless Eckert for his suggestion to reserve a type for
   future extension of the message type space.  Also thanks to Mykyta
   Yevstifeyev for reviewing the document and proposing improvements to
   the text.
