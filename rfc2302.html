   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original TIFF specification [TIFF] to obtain complete feature and
   technical details.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph"> 2.1 TIFF Scope

   TIFF describes image data that typically comes from scanners, frame
   grabbers, and paint- and photo-retouching programs. TIFF is not a
   printer language or page description language. The purpose of TIFF is
   to describe and store raster image data.  A primary goal of TIFF is
   to provide a rich environment within which applications can exchange
   image data. This richness is required to take advantage of the
   varying capabilities of scanners and other imaging devices.  Though
   TIFF is a rich format, it can easily be used for simple scanners and
   applications as well because the number of required fields is small.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2  TIFF Features</h3></a>

   Some of the features of TIFF (from [TIFF]) are:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    - TIFF is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color,
      and full-color image data in several color spaces.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    - TIFF includes a number of compression schemes that allow
      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
      applications.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    - TIFF is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as new
      needs arise.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">    - TIFF allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or
      special-purpose information.
	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.  MIME Definition</h2></a>

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1  image/tiff</h3></a>

   The image/tiff content-type was previously defined in RFC 1528 as
   containing TIFF 6.0 encoded image data, with specific reference made
   to a subset known as TIFF Class F.  This document re-defines the
   original image/tiff definition to refer to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on TIFF 6.0 [TIFF] encoded image data,
   consistent with existing practice for TIFF aware Internet
   applications.  This definition is further enhanced by introducing the
   new "application parameter" (section 3.2) to enable identification of
   a specific subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions for the encoded image
   data.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2  Application parameter</h3></a>

   There are cases where it may be useful to identify the application
   applicable to the content of an image/tiff body.  Typically, this
   would be used to assist the recipient in dispatching a suitable
   rendering package to handle the display or processing of the image
   file.  As a result, an optional "application" parameter is defined
   for image/tiff to identify a particular application's subset of TIFF
   and TIFF extensions for the encoded image data, if it is known.  No
   values are defined in this document.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Example using a fictional value 'foo':

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">                 Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo

   There is no default value for application, as the absence of the
   application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image is
   Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the
   application.   It is up to the recipient's implementation to
   determine the application (if necessary) and render the image to the
   user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IANA Registration</h2></a>

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/tiff

   MIME media type name: image

   MIME subtype name: tiff

   Required parameters: none
   Optional parameters: application

      There is no format specified for the value of this parameter
      in addition to that specified by [MIME1].  Various
      applications of TIFF may define values as required.  New
      values should be defined in standards track RFCs and the
      values should be registered with IANA, using the
      registration form included in Appendix A.  There is no
      default value for application, as the absence of the
      application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image
      is Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the
      application.  It is up to the implementation to determine
      the application (if necessary) and render the image to the
      user.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred

   Security considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TIFF utilizes a structure which can store image data and
      attributes of this image data.   The fields defined in the
      TIFF specification are of a descriptive nature and provide
      information that is useful to facilitate viewing and
      rendering of images by a recipient.  As such, the fields
      currently defined in the TIFF specification do not in
      themselves create additional security risks, since the
      fields are not used to induce any particular behavior by
      the recipient application.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      TIFF has an extensible structure, so that it is
      theoretically possible that fields could be defined in the
      future which could be used to induce particular actions on
      the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional
      security risks, but this type of capability is not
      supported in the referenced TIFF specification. Indeed, the
      definition of fields which would include such processing
      instructions is inconsistent with the goals and spirit of
      the TIFF specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Interoperability considerations:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
      applications (or profiles within applications) of TIFF may
      not be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode
      and attempt to display the encoded TIFF image data only to
      determine that the image cannot be rendered.  The presence
      of the application parameter may aid in allowing this
      determination before dispatching for rendering.  However, it
      should be noted that the parameter value is not intended to
      convey levels of capabilities for a particular application.
