	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and
   X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use by applications
   that support the United States National Security Agency's Suite B
   Cryptography.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The reader is assumed to have familiarity with [RFC5280].  This Suite
   B Certificate and CRL Profile is a profile of RFC 5280.  All MUST-
   level requirements of RFC 5280 apply throughout this profile and are
   generally not repeated here.  In cases where a MUST-level requirement
   is repeated for emphasis, the text notes the requirement is "in
   adherence with [RFC5280]".  This profile contains changes that
   elevate some MAY-level options in RFC 5280 to SHOULD-level and MUST-
   level in this profile; this profile also contains changes that
   elevate some SHOULD-level options in RFC 5280 to MUST-level for this
   profile.  All options from RFC 5280 that are not listed in this
   profile remain at the requirement level of RFC 5280.
   The reader is also assumed to have familiarity with [RFC5480], which
   specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public Key
   Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography and [RFC5758], which specifies algorithm identifiers for
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   Conventions Used in This Document</h2></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Requirements and Assumptions</h2></a>

   The goal of this document is to define a base set of certificate and
   CRL formats to support interoperability among Suite B solutions.
   Specific communities, such as the US National Security Systems, may
   define community profiles that further restrict certificate and CRL
   formats by mandating the presence of extensions that are optional in
   this base profile, defining new optional or critical extension types,
   or restricting the values and/or presence of fields within existing
   extensions.  However, communications between distinct communities
   MUST use the formats specified in this document when interoperability
   is desired.  (Applications may add additional non-critical extensions
   to these formats but they MUST NOT assume that a remote peer will be
   able to process them.)

	<a name="section-3.1"><h3>3.1   Implementing Suite B</h3></a>

   Every Suite B certificate MUST use the X.509 v3 format, and contain
   either:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      * An ECDSA-capable signing key, using curve P-256 or P-384; or

      * An ECDH-capable (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key
        establishment key, using curve P-256 or P-384.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Every Suite B certificate and CRL MUST be signed using ECDSA.  The
   signing Certification Authority's  (CA's) key MUST be on the curve
   P-256 or P-384 if the certificate contains a key on the curve P-256.
   If the certificate contains a key on the curve P-384, the signing
   CA's key MUST be on the curve P-384.  Any certificate and CRL MUST be
   hashed using SHA-256 or SHA-384, matched to the size of the signing
   CA's key.
	<a name="section-3.2"><h3>3.2   Suite B Object Identifiers</h3></a>

   The primary OID structure for Suite B is as follows per [X9.62],
   [SEC2], [RFC5480], and [RFC5758].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ansi-X9-62 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 10045 }<br>

      certicom-arc OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) }<br>

      id-ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         ansi-X9-62 keyType(2) 1 }<br>

      secp256r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         ansi-X9-62 curves(3) prime(1) 7 }<br>

      secp384r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         certicom-arc curve(0) 34 }<br>

      id-ecSigType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         ansi-X9-62 signatures(4) }<br>

      ecdsa-with-SHA256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         id-ecSigType ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 2 }<br>

      ecdsa-with-SHA384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
         id-ecSigType ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 3 }<br>

	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   Suite B Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile</h2></a>

   This Suite B certificate profile is a profile of [RFC5280].  The
   changes in the requirements from RFC 5280 are listed here.  Note that
   RFC 5280 has varying mandates for marking extensions as critical or
   non-critical.  This profile changes some of those mandates for
   extensions that are included in Suite B certificates.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4.1"><h3>4.1   signatureAlgorithm</h3></a>

   The two algorithm identifiers used by Suite B are:
   1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 for ecdsa-with-SHA256 and 1.2.840.10045.4.3.3 for
   ecdsa-with-SHA384, as described in [RFC5758] AND [X9.62].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The parameters MUST be absent as per [RFC5758].
	<a name="section-4.2"><h3>4.2   signatureValue</h3></a>

   ECDSA digital signature generation is described in [FIPS186-3].  An
   ECDSA signature value is comprised of two unsigned integers, denoted
   as r and s.  r and s MUST be represented as ASN.1 INTEGERs.  If the
   high order bit of the unsigned integer is a 1, an octet with the
   value 0x00 MUST be prepended to the binary representation before
   encoding it as an ASN.1 INTEGER.  Unsigned integers for the P-256 and
   P-384 curves can be a maximum of 32 and 48 bytes, respectively.
   Therefore, converting each r and s to an ASN.1 INTEGER will result in
   a maximum of 33 bytes for the P-256 curve and 49 bytes for the P-384
   curve.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The ECDSA signatureValue in an X.509 certificate is encoded as a BIT
   STRING value of a DER-encoded SEQUENCE of the two INTEGERS.  As per
   [RFC5480], the structure, included for convenience, is as follows:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      ECDSA-Sig-Value ::= SEQUENCE {
          r  INTEGER,
          s  INTEGER
        }

   For example, in a signature using P-256 and hex notation:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      r=  52e3f7b7 27fba9e8 eddb1d08 3b75c188

   For ECDSA signing keys and ECDH key agreement keys, the algorithm ID,

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The parameters of the AlgorithmIdentifier in this field MUST use the
   namedCurve option.  The specifiedCurve and implicitCurve options
   described in [RFC5480] MUST NOT be used.  The namedCurve MUST be

   [RFC5480].

   [SEC1].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Suite B implementations MAY use either the uncompressed form or the
   compressed form of the elliptic curve point [RFC5480].  For
   interoperability purposes, all relying parties MUST be prepared to

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The elliptic curve public key (an ECPoint that is an OCTET STRING) is
   mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a BIT STRING) as follows:  the most
