                        The 'tn3270' URI Scheme

<h2>Abstract</h2>

   This document is the specification of the 'tn3270' Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) scheme, which is used to designate the access to the
   resources available via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) and Telnet 3270
   Enhanced mode (TN3270E).  It updates RFC 1041 and RFC 2355, which
   specify these protocols, and RFC 1738, which firstly mentioned this
   URI scheme without defining its syntax and semantics.

	<a name="section-1"><h2>1.   Introduction</h2></a>

   This document specifies the 'tn3270' Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme, which is used to designate the access to the resources
   available via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) and Telnet 3270 Enhanced mode
   (TN3270E).

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) is a name used to denote the special mode
   of Telnet session [RFC0854].  If it is used, the 3270 data stream
   [GA23-0059] is used when transmitting data during the Telnet session,
   whereas the Telnet 3270 Regime option [RFC1041] is used to enable and
   negotiate its use.  (See [RFC1576] for some other background
   information on TN3270.)  Telnet 3270 Enhanced mode (TN3270E) has a
   similar principle; see RFC 2355 [RFC2355] for its specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The 'tn3270' URI scheme was firstly mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738]
   as used in URIs that designate the access to "Interactive 3270
   emulation sessions".  Following the creation of the URI schemes
   registry per RFC 4395 [RFC4395], this scheme was added to the
   "Provisional URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  However, RFC 1738
   [RFC1738] does not give any definition of syntax or semantics of the
   'tn3270' URIs and does not have any guidelines for registration of
   this scheme.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   Since there is no acceptable specification of the 'tn3270' URI, there
   is a risk that somebody might try to implement it with some new,
   possibly undocumented, syntax, just by looking at the IANA registry.
   In order to minimize such risk, this document gives a precise
   definition of syntax, semantics, use of this URI, and it registers
   the corresponding scheme.  It also updates RFC 2355 [RFC2355], RFC
   1738 [RFC1738], and RFC 1041 [RFC1041].
   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].
   Registration procedures for new URI schemes are defined in RFC 4395
   [RFC4395].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-1.1"><h3>1.1   Terminology</h3></a>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2"><h2>2.   URI Scheme Definition</h2></a>

	<a name="section-2.1"><h3>2.1   URI Scheme Syntax</h3></a>

   The 'tn3270' URI takes the following form (the syntax below is non-
   normative):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      tn3270://<userinfo>@<host>:<port>/

   where the <userinfo> part with the "@" (at) sign character, as well
   as the <port> part with the preceding ":" (colon) character, is
   OPTIONAL.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The normative syntax of the 'tn3270' URI is defined in <tn3270-uri>
   ABNF [RFC5234] rule:

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">     tn3270-uri       = "tn3270:" "//" authority ["/"]

   where the <authority> rule is specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The semantics of each part of the 'tn3270' URI are defined below, in
   Section 2.2.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-2.2"><h3>2.2  URI Scheme Semantics</h3></a>

   The <host> part of the 'tn3270' URI, which is REQUIRED, denotes the
   host to which the TN3270 or TN3270E connection is to be established.
   The <userinfo> part is considered to define the information for use
   in the Telnet Authentication option [RFC2941], which might be used
   during the TN3270 or TN3270E session.  The <port> part, if present,
   denotes the port on which the TCP connection to the <host> is to be
   established.  If it is absent, the default port SHALL be 23, as
   registered in [PORTREG].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-3"><h2>3.   Security Considerations</h2></a>

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].
   Since 'tn3270' URIs provide access to services that are available via
   TN3270 and TN3270E, which do not add any new security issues to the
   Telnet session, as they are a modified form of it, there are no other
   security considerations for 'tn3270' URIs that are not discussed in
   RFC 4248 [RFC4248], the 'telnet' URI scheme specification.

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">   The Telnet protocol, as well as TN3270 and TN3270E, is inherently
   insecure.  Those needing remote login access and related services are
   encouraged to use a more secure technology, such as Secure Shell
   [RFC4251].

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">	<a name="section-4"><h2>4.   IANA Considerations</h2></a>

   IANA updated the registration of the 'tn3270' URI scheme using the
   following registration template (see [RFC4395]):

</p><p class="rfcparagraph">      URI scheme name: tn3270

      Status: Permanent

      URI scheme syntax: see Section 2.1 of RFC 6270

      URI scheme semantics: see Section 2.2 of RFC 6270

      URI scheme encoding considerations: there are no other encoding
      considerations for 'tn3270' URIs that are not described in RFC
      3986 [RFC3986]

      Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) [RFC1041]
      and Telnet 3270 Enhanced Mode (TN3270E) [RFC2355]

      Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC 6270
